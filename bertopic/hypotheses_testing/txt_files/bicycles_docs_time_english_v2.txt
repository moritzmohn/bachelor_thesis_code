Consumer simulator of the Veltheim / / (PK) traffic center traditionally offers the traffic safety center at its stand at the Geneva Motor Show a sample on further training.This year “traffic safety and energy consumption” is announced.
It is about the special topic "More security thanks to less energy".The saying amazes until you recognize the connections.If someone drives, for example, in the highest possible walk on low tours, he can - without disadvantage with regard to speed or driving comfort - roll in the urban of the brakingness.
It causes less exhaust gases and less noise.The generally emerging aggressiveness in road traffic is also automatically lost with the distance to the next road user necessary for the modern driving style.In elaborate tinkering work, experts from the Veltheim center, together with film experts and software experts, have developed a simulator program specially tailored to this problem.
At the Veltheim stand, it is now “live” for the first time.It is matched to a real -existing street between Wildegg and Aarau.Everyone can “drive” within 7 minutes, as you can not only achieve better travel times, but also master the route with less consumption.

The first long-distance cycling route of Switzerland / / Spi.Just in time for the start of the new bike season, the first busy bike route in Switzerland was recently presented to the public in Meiringen: the Aareradweg from Meiringen to Koblenz.
The very varied route was drawn up by the Bernese Oberland and Bernese district association together with the Velore trip organizer Euretrek.The concept is based on the extremely successful role models in Austria such as the Tauern or Danube Cycle Path.The route leads from Meiringen along Lake Brienzer to the Giessbach Falls to Iseltwald and Interlaken.
From Interlaken it goes to Beatenberg and down to Sigriswil down to Lake Thun to Gunten.You put the ship over to Thun and drive from there to Bern and to Aarberg.The next stages are Bielersee, Büren and Solothurn;
Finally, via Olten it goes to Koblenz to the mouth of the Aare into the Rhine.As an organized trip with or without a guided tour, the route from Euretrek from Zurich and Eurobike from Austria (addresses see further boxes) is offered.It can be booked as a cozy tour in six stages or as a sporty tour in four stages and with various hotel categories.

Together instead of against each other / / lre.The national bike day, which also took place in Zurich on Saturday, pulled hundreds of cyclists onto the street.The day was under the motto "More space for bike: halve car traffic".
In her speech, Zurich's city councilor Kathrin Martelli emphasized the importance of the wheel as a means of transportation, especially in local transport.Cycling is not only environmentally friendly, but a welcome alternative to car traffic in the increasing space.It advocated increased mutual tolerance of all road users.
Peaceful coexistence is only possible with each other.Actually, this goal is very easy to achieve with a little consideration.However, she finds that reality is still very far from the ideal state.
It is therefore necessary to grant the cyclists more space in the city centers and to ensure that the Veloweg network will continue to be expanded.Barbara Flury, on the age of 75 on the road with her bike in the city every day, emphasized in her speech how important cycling can also be for older people.It not only gives a good feeling that it can still be sitting on the steel horse with a straight back, but above all enable mobility that is no longer possible.
However, it is problematic that cycling has become dangerous due to the high traffic.Some bike paths also led to chaotic situations in which the cyclists are forced to dodge, since the paths resulted directly in streets or intersections.The cyclists, who had gathered at the Münsterhof in bright sunshine, then drove through the city center and the red factory, where a cultural-musical mix was on the program until dawn.
The aim is to draw attention to the concerns of cyclists.This time signatures were collected for a petition that demands halving car traffic and more space for cyclists and pedestrians in the cities.The colorful Völklein of cyclists who took part in this year's bike day showed that this concern has many supporters.

No free (Velo) trip on the Utoquai / / Velos on slalom trip, TA from April 22nd.So it is claimed that mixing traffic applies in the entire right -wing quaian system, that is, the driving ban for bicycles no longer applies in the entire quaian system.
That is clearly wrong!The regime of so -called mixing traffic in the quaian layers only applies from Bellevue to the height of Feldeggstrasse and has been re -signalized accordingly.The signaled general driving ban, i.e. also to bicycles, continues to apply to the whole area of the Quaian layers, i.e. from the height of Feldeggstrasse to the Tiefenbrunnen lido!
Neither the announcement by Ms. City Councilor Martelli changes something nor the TA article.The city police alone are responsible for the traffic regime, and fortunately, with the exception of the Bellevue section to Feldeggstrasse - this does not release the quaian layers for Velos.From a pedestrian perspective, mixing traffic is clearly rejected in the entire quaian position.
The pedestrian association Zurich therefore asked the police board that the general cancellation of the general driving ban was officially published beforehand so that recourse can be raised.Christoph Sautter, Pedgrowers' Association Zurichm traffic on the outer quaian layers.

Campaign «Velo everyday life» / / ncw.With various smaller campaigns, the new campaign “Die Velo in everyday life” by IG Velo Switzerland was presented in twenty Swiss cities.
The campaign, which is supported by the federal government, various cantons, cities and municipalities, is created in a period of two years and is intended to indicate the advantages of bicycle as an everyday means of transport.For this purpose, IG Velo Switzerland sent a brochure on the subject of “Velos in Working Converale” to 18,000 companies and public administrations.The brochure contains suggestions on how farms can be equipped with simple means and can be prompted to switch to the bike for local transport.
In Zurich, the civil engineering office in the Amtshaus V is using a good example of how to experience the media orientation on the Werdmühleplatz.The bike storage room was provided with a workbench and an air compressor, showers are present in the basement, and additional bicycle parking spaces were created around the building by means of simpler, on the wall or on the floor.A velopool with ten bicycles is available to all employees.
Operations with private bicycles are compensated for with ten rapps per kilometer driven.Pete Mijinsen, Managing Director of IG Velo Zurich, and Beat Brechbühl from the civil engineering office agreed that the bike was not only a cheap, but in city traffic, at a distance of up to six kilometers.This Saturday, the national “Velo-Tag”, a “sympathy tour” for Velofans takes place under the knowledgeable guidance of bike.

The Limmatquai - An important Velo section / / by Paul Böschdie City of Zurich used CHF 25 million in the eighties and early nineties to produce a piece of work.
The loan was spoken in 1984 in the referendum with an overwhelming majority.The authorities were obliged to set up an attractive bicycle route of around 200 kilometers in length by the end of 1992.The result is a torso: a piece of bike path here, a piece of bike strips there.
As with a puzzle game, the edges were assumed.The outdoor quarters are richly blessed with bike paths.On the weekends, the bicycle families and couples are looking for their way into the countryside.
On Monday, on the other hand, when the bank official drives the secretary to work in the city center, the bike remains in the basement.For many, driving to the city with the bike is a horror performance.Because the core pieces that the puzzle first make a picture are missing.
As once at the Sz, we take the cycling route through the Platzspitz as an example.This path from Wipkingen and Unterstrass is open again.It is an ideal and safe access to the city center, but this is only up to the Walchebrücke / Museumstrasse junction at the main train station.
Here the idyll ends.There are many people who would love to swing on the saddle, but who are shy away from the dangers that threaten the crowds on Bahnhofplatz or when turning into Löwenstrasse.But what use is the good wheel strip in Löwenstrasse when access is a test of courage?
Hundreds of meters cycle path are devalued because of a short bottleneck.The situation is reminiscent of the Sihltal and Üetlibergbahn when it still had its end station in Selnau station.A large part of the transportation potential remained unused - because the link to the rest of the rail network was missing.
Winterthur shows the CHF 25 million, which have been spent on sections for ten years, are poorly invested money as long as the gaps in the city center are not closed.The call to complete the unfinished is more than the standing for the special interest of a special group of road users.Because only with a higher bike content can be made, in the case of air pollution control with sensible effort, noticeable progress.
The bike is the patentest and fastest means of transportation in the city, cycling is healthy, economical and a good balance for officeists.Zurich is the city of short distances, a large part of the movements measures less than five kilometers.Today 7 percent of all paths in the city are covered with the bike, 28 percent on foot, 28 percent by car and motorcycle, 37 with tram, bus and train.
Winterthur shows that an increase is possible.Here the bike content is around 20 percent.No expensive measures for the promotion of environmentally friendly mobility is point 2 of the city council's traffic policy 5-point program.
It is part of the generally recognized repertoire of political confessions and must not be mere lip service.A kind of snowball effect has to be triggered: a small impetus that triggers further impulses.The more bicycles shape city traffic, the more secure and more attractive it becomes cycling, and the more people dare to swing on the saddle.
It is not necessary to meet expensive measures, bike strips and advance traces.They must not go at the expense of the pedestrians, because the bike belongs on the street, and the potential for conflict between two -wheeler and footmakers must be reduced (which the Velorowdies should finally write behind the ears).to four most important bicycle routes in the city to close the gaps.The former GP councilor Toni Baur and the FDP representative Rolf Walther asked this with a motion in 1995.
You have recognized that the previous piece work brings little.The core of the claim is the route from the Walchebrücke / main train station to the Bellevue.Only when it is possible to establish a safe bike compound that many of the cycle path fragments in the surrounding quarters get their full sense.
The future traffic regime in Limmatquai is currently under discussion in the local council.The bike must not be forgotten - not only in the interest of the bike travelers.Because the promotion of cycling brings more traffic safety, homeliness and health for everyone.

Bike driver dilemma / / cyclist in the city.PICTURE
Archive Taverkehr controls, TA of November 26th New Community claims in the TA interview that the bike controls in Zurich are handled as intensely today as four years ago.This is demonstrably wrong.Velokon rolls of this extent have not existed in Zurich for at least ten years.
Five years ago, such an action against the users of the most environmentally friendly means of transport would have led to a collective outcry.The trigger for the controls is certainly also the higher buses, which are now also worthwhile to pay a casting from bicycle.The Velo interest group is also of the opinion that bicycle traveling rights and obligations have to have or must adhere to rules.
However, the crux is in detail: the traffic rules are still largely designed for motorized traffic, and bike travelers often have to behave illegally to ensure their safety.So that the buttoning police do not have to expose itself to the accusation of cynicism, it should be able to offer the bicycle -driving legal routes.
This is neither the case on Bahnhofstrasse, on Limmatquai, nor on the Langstrasse, where IG Velo has proposed solutions several times or is now recurring against the tender on the Rennweg.Against this background, the bus distribution campaign for pure eyewiping and alibi exercise.Common information campaigns for more consideration between road users, such as the St. Gallen city police, would continue to help everyone in the endeavor for an environmentally and bike-friendly, but also pedestrian-friendly city of Zurich.

The four main branches in the Veloweg Network / / "Four passion routes in the city of Zurich are to be realized. For this, the city council applies for a loan of CHF 1.84 million.
Two of the proposed main routes are to lead from a city limits to the opposite, the two others are tangent (see map): Zollikon-Hauptbahnhof-Schlierenadliswil-Hauptbahnhof-Seebachhirlanden-Hochschule-Schwamendingen-Affoltern28 Lückendie with a total length of around 40 kilometersTo a large extent, have already been realized today, but have 28 gaps.These gaps are to be closed by 2002.For this purpose, the city council requested a loan of CHF 1.84 million to the local council.
Measures on over -communal streets are financed by the canton.With this money, "" simple and inexpensive solutions "" are to be realized, but which must not only have an alibic character, the city council writes in its instruction to the parliament: "" The measures should be modeled for further promotion of bicycle traffichave urban streets. "" The application of the city council goes back to a motion by Toni Baur (GP) and Rolf Walther (FDP) and is in conversation with the motionaires, with civil engineering, city police, IG Velo and - where over -communal streets are affected -was developed with the cantonal administration.
Veloweg through the Limmatquaiviele of the 28 gaps can be closed with little effort.Others are connected to the traffic regime or buildings with larger interventions.A bicycle strip is planned in the north on the Limmatquai between Torgasse and Rüdenplatz;
The further path via Rudolf-Brun Brücke and Bahnhofqua Unit is shown to cyclists with pictograms.The route continues westward via Zollbrücke, Konradstrasse, Heinrichstrasse, Escher-Wyss-Platz, Bernerstrasse Nord and Bandlistrasse.The Route Adliswil -Seebach also leads via the Limmatquai via Brandschenkestrasse, Paradeplatz and Münsterbrücke.
From the main train station it goes via Platzspitz and Lux-Guyer-Weg to the Kornhaus and Rötelstrasse.For the driveway to Bucheggplatz, a widening of the roadway is necessary in the Rötelstrasse over a length of 270 meters.Knorz at the Central Station Center, however, remains: the dangerous knot Bahnhofquai / Walchebrücke / Museumstrasse.

"Veloland Switzerland" with nine national main routes / / on May 30th A big bicycle festival will take place in Bern, the birthday for "Veloland Switzerland", a total length of 3300 kilometers covering the whole of Switzerland.Desize a bike tourist temptation for all active recovery, because in terms of their facility and attractiveness, the nine crissopers are unparalleled across all regions.
In addition, route guides, specially selected accommodation offers and transport options for bridging difficult route sections provide all conceivable help."Veloland Switzerland" is the fruit of persistent perseverance and more minute preparation for years.And it is also a community work in which authorities, economy, tourism, public transport and associations of various objectives are integrated.
The trigger for a nationwide bike route network was the bike office Olten, a collective company grown out of the bike scene, which realized the Solothurn cycle path on the occasion of the CH 91.Even then, in the minds of the bicycle agency members, the idea of putting a route network across the whole country that should encourage tour and recreational cyclists to drive Switzerland and its diverse nature.An ambitious project in which the existing bike path network could be used in realization, which was, however, greatly expanded and supplemented with new services.
The basis is nine routes with characteristic names, as is the case with names such as "Autoute du Soleil" or "Autostrada dei fiori"., 316 km.2 Rhein-Route: "The R (h) an enjoyable", Andermatt-Basel, 424 km.3 north-south-route: "The classic", Basel-Chiasso, 363 km. 4 Alpen Panorama route."The challenging", Aigle-St.Margrethen, 483 km.5 Mittelland route: "The unique", Romanshorn-Lausanne, 365 km. 6 Graubünden-Route: "Die St. Breathtaking", Chur-Martina / Bellinzona, 152 /130 km.7 Jura route: "Special », Basel-Nyon 275 km.8 Aare route:" The varied ", Gletsch-Koblenz, 305 km.9 Lake Route:" The Water Kingdom ", Montreux-Rorschach, 501 km.
These national bicycle routes are branched in 3000 kilometers of regional SRB Velowege, so that a well-known Velonetz is now waiting for cyclists.Minuceable preparation no doubt - behind the matter is an immense planning and workload.And persuasiveness, because there were many if and buts to be cleared up, Thomas Ledergerber from the Velobüro Olten recalls.
Switzerland showed tourism, at that time still Swiss traffic center and today with marketing for the cyclist paradise at the forefront, first the cold shoulder.The first contact with the Swiss Tourism Association (STV), which as a partner in the project planning community, was more pronounced.Route designs, recognitions, text and image procurement, creation of documentation, evaluation of surveys, presentations with authorities and possible partners, sponsorship searches, financing models (which satisfy all associations and cantons) required a shaken work before the Veloland Switzerland Foundation in November 1995could be founded.
It belongs to it: the 26 cantons, the Swiss construction, planning and environmental protection director conference, the Swiss tourism association, Switzerland Tourism, SBB, the Touring Club Switzerland, the Swiss Traffic Club, the Swiss cycling and engine driverBUND, the Association for Transport, Sport and Leisure, IG Velo Switzerland, the Association of Swiss manufacturers, large -scale lists and importers from the two -wheeler industry, the Swiss Advice Center for Accident Prevention and the Swiss Olympic Association.The 36-page colored prospectus "3300 km escape route before Tourism-Veloland Switzerland" provides routes for a bike holiday grob planning, reference points for hotel vouchers, bicycle rental stations of the railway, bike holiday package offers, prices and addresses.Anyone who plunges into the big bike adventure involves one of the three official route guides as a guide, each contain three national bike routes.
Their information content hardly leaves any questions open.They contain detailed card sections with the signposted routes, information about the route system, list the suitable partner companies for the overnight stays and point out with colored illustrations and short texts on the well-known and unknown on the side of the path.Timeters with tariffs provide information about the routes recommended for the unloaded routes.
These can be road sections with high traffic volume or sweat -stroying gradients.A propos timetables:
A free bike schedule in regional timetable format records all trains approved for the bicycle bike on 80 routes.Consistent numbers and signs in the timetable, on the means of transport and in the route guides facilitate planning.Peter Rüfenacht, Velo-officer at the SBB, explains that additional transport options such as larger Veloplattforms could be created due to weather and seasonal and seasonal.
The bike schedule is supplemented with a directory of trains from the Zurich - Basel - Bern metropolitan triangle to the endpoints of the bike routes.On the way on the "water -rich" "en route", with a map, route guide and Velofahplan in the luggage on the "water -rich".A warning name, because the longest bicycle route leads to the Gestades of Walen-, Zurich-, Sihl-, ägeri-, Zuger-, Vierwaldstätter-, Alpnacher-, Wichel-, Sarner, Lungern-, Brienzer-and Thunersee, Lac Dur Vernex and Greyerzersee.
On this Tour de Suisse, the cyclist rolls unnoticed strasses on 50 kilometers and paths and coped with 3320 meters of height difference, without loading routes.The less enjoyable sections of Pfäffikon SZ-Einiedeln by train (SOB), Unterägeri train by bus (ZVB), Lungern-Brünig can be avoided with the Brünigbahn / SBB and Brienz-Iseltwald with the ship (ship farm BLS).The signaling leaves no doubt about the path to be taken.
Red signpost with “Veloland” logos, a blue square with the route number, primary and confirmation boards, distance information, height difference boards in front of gradients and information boards at station connections are part of a guiding system through the bicycle-dorado Switzerland, a comfort that drivers have known for a long time.In addition to the transport companies, the guest businesses for bike tourists are the most important “Veloland” partners.In 16 towns, the bed exchange plays a remarkable innovation in the tourist offer, in which the innkeepers with new overnight accommodations can react to supply and demand and the cyclists can benefit from cheap offers.
All train stations and travel agencies in the whole of Switzerland have access to this stock exchange.The diversity of the accommodations ranges from sleeping in the straw via campsites, youth hostels and guest operations of all kinds to the four -star hotel.The accommodation companies, which are awarded with a quality label, meet the condition "bicycle-friendly", have a drying room for wet clothes, a final bike room, the most necessary patch stuff and supply the bike tourists with strong juice and muesli-Zmorge with new energy.
Bike tourism as an economic factor planning and execution of the tourist project cost money.The largest chunks on the output side names Peter Anrenig, Vice Director at the Swiss Tourism Association, the cantonal costs for administration, routing signalization and external orders, which he estimates at around CHF 4.5 million.CHF 1.1 million were spent on project planning and planning in 1995/96.
There are also project management (1.1 million), information boards (1 million), route guide (1 million) and promotion (2 million).This has not yet been done, because another CHF 3.6 million are used for the operating development and optimization phase from 1999 to 2002.finance director
Annig indicates that this sum not only gradually enclosed improvements in the route network but also market research.It hopes for information about the return flow of invested funds.Bookings for overnight stays and the tickets issued by the transport companies will provide meaningful figures.
The black on white expenses for Veloland Switzerland are faced with non -measurable income, funds that also include bicycle sales, spare parts, repairs, sportswear -, flow back to the hospitality and the transport company.Investigations in Holland, however, have shown that the costs for a new velor route are recorded after one year at the latest.The state of Schleswig-Holstein puts the income from bike tourism at 1.2 billion D-Mark (1992).
In the Münsterland, a third of all overnight stays (1 million) are eliminated on cycling tourism.The image “Velotourism = Army-Swallowing Tourism” is to be corrected as soon as possible.Hannes

But a Veloparkhaus at the HB Zurich / / C. W. City Councilor Kathrin Martelli opened on Monday together with representatives of the asylum organization for the canton of Zurich and the Velo interest group between Zollstrasse and main train station "Velogate" - a barrack in which a good 150Velos can be accommodated dry and safely.The fifth season of the free rental “Züri rolls” has also started these days.
The fact that transportation means in the overall context of a often combined mobility that the train needs a local connection and that the bike is particularly suitable for this, if it can also be parked somewhere, is an older insight.Ten years ago, in September 1988, the city's vocalists, however, rejected an initiative for a 20 million franc to parking hall under the main train station with a connection between circles 4 and 5, especially in the last phases of the railway renovation, the decentralized parking matters were increased significantly, but in the last phases of the railway station, especially in the last phases of the railway station.Especially on the two sides of the underpass, on the post office and the customs bridge.Velos can be attached and secured on around 1250 hooks and eyelets.
The variety of access routes and needs will certainly meet this.The situation has also been significantly improved at other train stations, especially at the Stadelhofen.What was still missing was a system for upscale claims, covered, guarded and looked after.
On the space on Zollstrasse, which is long used for construction facilities, right next to platform 18, “Velogate” now offers 150 places with services such as cleaning, small streams, timetable advice, sale of vignettes and daily general subscriptions.Users pay for a certain period of time (CHF 12 per day, 120 francs per year), hang their two -wheeler on a hydraulically moving arm of a carousel and secure it with their castle.The room is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., the forecourt continuously.
The SBB provide the area, the investment costs for the city were limited to around CHF 120,000.The company should be self -supporting, as the work - as with free rental - is directed by the asylum organization of refugees and newly also done by other unemployed.- The “bike” is a provisional.
Definitely solutions are hoped for as part of Eurogate and the new Sihlpost.“Cages” with carousel devices were also set up on the Kasernenstrasse.For rent keys can be found in the “Tagblatt” on Tuesday.
The bike rental is running again by the end of October (against depositing an ID and CHF 20).“Velogate” and the Altstetten train station have been added to the stations at the Globus (Bahnhofstrasse), on the Theaterplatz, the Oerlikon market square and at the Enge train station.“Züri rolls” is financed by sponsors and the Federal Office for Refugees.

The Touring Club in Switzerland (TCS) is always noticeable for cyclists.Insiders are certain that the previous bicycle nobility, the IG-Velo Switzerland and the Swiss Rad and Motor Driver Association (SRB), are forced to move.It is only a matter of time before membership cards come, the bike drivers open up privileges of all kinds and at the same time can be used as a comprehensive means of payment.
Services such as bicycle service, booking tourist offers or general advice offers Switzerland tourism with regard to Veloland Switzerland about its bike, 157 02 04.The fact that bike in the shop window is currently in the focus of interest is also shown over a length of 36 meters in the most respected shop window in Switzerland of the Bernese department store Loeb.The evolutionary history of the bike is documented there until June 7th.
Villiger Bicycles Switzerland sells directly from the shop window and shows what avant -garde means for the city bike: Full -suspended city bikes are now offered as a matter of course, with parking light and luggage systems, on which you do not finger when installing a basket.With another variety of high-tech bike, the European headquarters of the sporting goods manufacturer Scott (Givisiez FR) dominates the spring discussion around mountain bikes:
Scott Intoxica is called his fully sprung Bergvelo built on a carbon fiber structure, which looks like it would come from an Italian designer smithy.Optics and lightweight construction are currently the big topic: Simon Joller, technology editor of the cycling climb "" Move News "", has developed a racing bike, which with its almost 5.8 kg is the lightest bike in the world.The trend is clear and shows that the Union Cyclist Internationale (UCI) should probably be on the wrong track:
The cycling roof association wants to restrict the development of bicycle technology with the edition that in future only racing bikes with diamond geometries, i.e. with the conventional triangular frames, are to be constructed.Electronically cushioned initiatives can delay the development a bit.
In the meantime, the K2 brand's brand springs through the landscape-with an electronically controlled smart shock control, which automatically sets the suspension.This is described by the Technical University of Hamburg as a clear progress.In the area of the sprung forks for the front wheel, the double bridge fork, as it is already standard for motorcycles, is the bid of the hour.
These new suspensions are so powerful that forks hardly break anymore, but instead the frames no longer always withstand the loads that a radical mountain bike can be exposed.Not all innovations are undisputed.The specialist magazines have been hammered in the keyword freerider for several months.
What is meant is a bike with a lot of travel and an upright seating position, which is intended to convey the "" ultimate feeling of the loose ride ".Now the stunned bikers hear that the mountain velos of seasoned racing drivers are also fully sprung - and not yet sixteen kilos, but at most their eleven or ten weigh.The young makers of the Burgdorf company BKTECH do not care for weight problems:
They have now sold a three-digit number of so-called e-bikes, electrovelos.According to the award -winning young entrepreneurs, more and more people want to put their daily way to work with an electrovelo.And have the fascinating experience of being supported by a drive that consumes just 20 centers for 20 kilometers.

The silently rolling tricycles cover 10,000 km - with a maximum pace of 80 km / h.In the afternoon, seven electromobiles from the Swiss company Twike stopped in Winterthur-Töss to charge their batteries in the workshop of the city works.The initiator of the campaign is FDP National Councilor François Loeb, who leads the tour with his Twike.The Bernese politician and entrepreneur wants to break a lance for "" good Swiss high-tech products and alternative forms of mobility ".
The Twike-Mobil needs a maximum of 800 kilowatt hours for the whole trip, which corresponds to 80 liters of petrol.Loeb, whose own company sells smart cars, among other things, emphasized that he was not traveling out of entrepreneurial interest, but from Goodwill: "" I only have a share of Twike."" Loeb is not certain whether the group will arrive at the North Cape: A Twike-Mobil can also be driven with muscle strength like a bike, but the batteries have to be recharged every 50 to 80 km.
This is not always easy in Eastern European countries."" We will have to improvise a lot. "" (Mö) picture

General Way for Velos at Guisan-Quai / / C. W. In the city of Zurich, the traffic area is apparently definitely distributed except for the last square meter.
Sometimes something can be changed, there is “new” space.On the General Guisan Quai, the three city-side traces (towards the narrow) have been reduced to two in favor of a bike strip.This gives the cars more space on their remaining paths, the right -wing turners (into the Stockerstrasse), which could inhibit the flow of traffic, are not very numerous, and the wheel strip - sometimes sometimes narrow and dangerous than nothing - is of more comfortable width.
The use of one of the two main traces was bicycle drivers - and actually the automotiveists behind them - could hardly be expected.The innovation should also cause the illegal route from Seefeld - left, on the part, over the Quai bridge and between harassed footballs into the quaian layers.At the confluence of the Claridenstrasse at the congress house, a transition to the "mixed" used promenade is set up - in contrast, there is not everyone at the pension towards Wollishofen to the left.
A bottleneck remains, especially towards Bellevue, since the Veloweg (or the permitted use of the pedestrian area) ends with the Guisan-Quai just before the unpleasant funnel.The sequel to the sidewalk has now been legally legalized.At the point of the bus station, which was moved to Bahnhofstrasse in connection with the detour around the locked Limmatquai, a yellow bicycle in a gray area, where two -legged bikes have to be taken into account.

"Veloland Switzerland" in the test / / Spi.The “Veloland Switzerland” was officially opened on May 30th.Nine large routes and various variants cover the whole country with a consistently signposted bike path network (cf.
NZZ from April 16, 98).May other countries like Austria have been successful with their showcase cycle paths for a long time, the project, which is carried out with good helvetic thoroughness and perfection, is unparalleled in Europe.On the 275-kilometer Jura route from Basel to Nyon, we subjected the “Veloland Switzerland” to an intensive test.
Always make the red signs with the Velo vacation, also want to drive bike and not stop every few kilometers, study the map or route booklet or ask locals about the path suitable for bike.Especially if you wanted to take a tour of several days, so far, frustrated, frustrated with the confusing local signage for cyclists, it has preferred to leave the car breeds.At least one was sure to get from A to B in a reasonable way.
Today, if you want this, you can cycle 3300 kilometers through the country, and it will actually find one of the red signs with a white bike at every intersection, at every junction, which reliably indicate the destination.We always found the signage in the right place at the loneliest heights of the freely, there was practically never uncertainty.At most, the local variants, which were also signaled with red signals, confused at the beginning:
Sometimes bicycles indicate three different directions.The main route is always provided with the corresponding number in white on a blue background.How far is it to the next stain?
It is only to be criticized that with distance information on the signs is handled in a sparingly.You can only find the branches of the big routes and station connections.Actually, distance information would be desirable every 10 kilometers, but in any case from one town to another.
At half past two, most cyclists want to know when the next pub can only be found in 20 kilometers.Although it is now quite possible to always go to the red signs, but if you want to plan your tour a bit, you will use the information material published by the “Veloland Switzerland” foundation.For the large overview there is the “Tourist Velokarte Switzerland” on a scale of 1: 301 000, which actually contains all the important information for the route itself.
If you are a little more interested in what awaits him on your trip, you are very well served with the official route guides.In the practical spiral-bound A5 cross format for the handlebar bag, there is a 1: 100,000 scale card for each section of the route as well as carefully selected and well-edited information about the places and sights on the way.What we lacked is, however, the description of the character of the respective stage, for example in the way "Always along the river banks" or "after the climbing elevated flat path" with a spectacular view ".
The summary of three large routes in one band makes the booklet unnecessarily difficult.We therefore used the emergency solution and simply separated the pages for our route.Future expenses should only contain one route each.
Always carry out a good velor route away from Hof to Hofmuss away from car breeds?This requirement is controversial.At the exit from Basel, for example, which leads quite confusingly in the zigzag through residential areas, we had the impression that we would have progressed faster and ultimately more secure on one of the regular default streets.
It is of course ideal if, like on the Jura heights, you can fall back on the well -maintained small streets that combine the scattered courtyards and on which a tractor or isolated day trippers are on the road.Overall, one seems to have found a good compromise between the use of the old traffic routes that connect the places on the fastest way and the demand to avoid the worst traffic.What to do when it gets steep?
Despite 21-speed circuits, mountains are an obstacle that should not be underestimated for the not purely sporty.In the bicycle cards, the gradients with one to three arrows, in the respective direction, are drawn.Three arrows mean gradients with more than 10 percent.
That should not be underestimated.Small agricultural roads such as in the Jura are often much steeper than the old Alpine passes.We found that, for example, passes such as Furka or Julier can be driven much faster and more than the many steep small ascents in the low mountain range.
Once we even accepted a detour of 30 kilometers across the French Le Frambourg in the Jura, since the official mountain route via Ste-Croix would have taken longer.On the other hand, of course, the agony of a leg -hard climb such as the Mont Soleil or the Col de Marchairuz are quickly forgotten if you enjoy the trips obtained by the bitter beauty of the Jura heights.If you want to save yourself demoralizing surprises - especially with children - you should study the card carefully and plan the stage cleverly: The heavy chunks prefer to tackle in the morning than after lunch with Vaud Saucissons in the stomach.
For a whole series of worst slopes on the nine routes, there is an excellent service of the railway: Colored numbers in the bicycle card indicate where a climbing aid is recommended by train, bus or cable car.The corresponding departure times can then be found in a timetable available at every larger train station.We tried it.
That also works perfectly.Veloland Switzerland, phone: +41 157 02 04. Internet:

Mobile (almost) without automobile / / es.In cooperation with a number of partners, the civil engineering office, more precisely the traffic planning department, has expanded the previous Velo city map of the city of Zurich, which has already been published in four editions, into a “mobility city plan”.On the back of the Veloplan, on which bicycle paths and bike strips are entered and the streets are rated on the basis of their “bicycle suitability”, there is a plan on which footpaths have their own signatures and the tram and bus lines including stops are recorded.
In addition, car rental companies and the locations of the “Züri Mobil” car cars are registered, but not the parking garages in the city.The users should be able to take the timetable, among other things, the optimally short footpaths, but also in particular beautiful walks and strollers.Cyclists find the current status of the route network including safe parking spaces.
All lines of public transport are specified, including the tram line extension to the Zurich trade fair and the Hallenstadion and the extension of the trolleybus line 33 to the Tiefenbrunnen station.In an accompanying book, numerous information about these means of transport and transportation is compiled.For example, the booklet can be found in which (often astonishingly short) times pedestrians have to expect to coping with inner -city routes, where you can register for "Züri Mobil", where bicycle workshops are located or where bicycle steels and the stolen bicycles are reportedcan become.
City councilor Kathrin Martelli, who presented the new work on Monday, advocated “efficient mobility”.The place for the "processing of mobility" is limited - especially in a city like Zurich.It is therefore an important task to optimize traffic, to organize mobility as best as possible to organize efficiently and environmentally friendly.
The “Mobility City Plan” counts for the infrastructure, which is necessary for efficient traffic management, it serves as information in favor of a self-responsible choice of means of transport.The Zurich traffic planning was supported by partners and sponsors to implement the “Mobility City Plan”.These include, for example, the Bundes Energie 2000's energy saving initiative, the VBZ, the Velo interest group and the working group law for pedestrians, but also the taxi center taxi 2000 and smart automobile.

Company messages / / Switzerland multi -link on the telephone network.The Multilink SA, Vernier, is a Swiss joint company of Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom, which together with the American sprint form the worldwide active joint venture Global One and who also want to build up common bases in Italy and Great Britain.
In Switzerland, the preparatory work has progressed most, as the Multilink officially starts operating on Friday.First of all, she mainly goes online for Geneva customers, but wants to extend her activities to the cities of Zurich and Basel at the beginning of next year.The company, which is headed by General Director Rolf Schurter, will employ around 100 people by the end of 1998 and will double this number within a year.
It should look similar in the vestation program, which is estimated for over 50 million CHF for 1998.Multilink's target audience are small and medium-sized companies as well as “by telephone active” private individuals with an important transnational conversation and data transmission.According to the management, the national and international tariffs of Multilink allow savings of up to 54 % to the Swisscom rates valid in early October.
The company considers the special rate of 30 RP to be particularly attractive.Each minute for the regions close to the border in France and Germany.Ww.
Loss of Logitech.The Logitech Group, which manufactures peripheral devices, had to accept a net loss of $ 7.1 million in the second business quarter at the end of September due to extraordinary expenses ($ 3.68 per share).For example, depreciation on research and development projects of the recently adopted Quickcam PC video business was made of $ 6.2 million.
Depreciation of $ 5.8 million on the traffic with Storm Technology (a change and participation), to which the Logitech scanner product line was sold in December 1997, were also urged.Either the buyer was poorly selected or the sold -out product line was less worth less than originally hoped for.But even in proper business, Logitech did not necessarily shine in the second quarter.
Consolidation -adjusted turnover increased by 2.2 % to $ 92.2 million, and the net profit without special expenses fell from $ 3.6 million to $ 3.1 million in the previous year.According to the assessment of Logitech, however, this met the expectations.For the 3rd and 4th business quarter, you are confident that sales and net profit can be significantly increased over the previous year's values.

Neuchâtel lake northern routes are not built / / According to the HPM project manager Daniel Leupi from Velobüro Olten, a special HPM topic is highly written on EXPO.01 on every species.Neuchâtel is all kind of bike species in Yverdon in Yverdon, in Murten an offer of various water vehicles is planned and in Biel there is above all the connection of the bike to everyday life in the center.
There are a few major events such as car-free experience days or a skating race.As far as the bike routes in the Expo area are concerned, the Velobüro mainly uses the existing national and regional bike routes network.A new line was planned between Neuenburg and Yverdon.
In the meantime, however, the canton has unfortunately declared itself because of the new construction of the SBB line and the Aussherstande motorway to carry out the route as intended north of the lake, Leupi regrets.With regard to the remaining new lines, especially the networking between Neuchâtel, Murten and Biel, Leupi is confident: «It works as planned.We can be suitable for the mass operation for mass operation
make. »The Velobüro Olten and the Veloland Switzerland Foundation are available for the implementation of the HPM project.The entrepreneurship office Schaer & Gerber in Bern, the company Euretrek / Eventur in Zurich and the Blaise Dériaz traffic consulting office in Geneva are involved in the project.According to Leupi, a special Expo velorouute guide is also planned.
This should be opened similarly to the already published bicycle area guides.Leupi: «The three Veloland route guides are already appearing in the third edition.In 1998 we sold around 50,000 books.

With muscle strength through the Expo.01 / / Last year, the Oltner Velobüro launched a new national bike route network, the “Veloland Switzerland”.Now the bicycle is to extend their know-how to Expo.01.
By mid-March, all details on the promising project "Human Powered Mobility", for short "HPM", are said to be available.so that our offer will be good, »says the 33 -year -old economist.Finally, several thousand “Human Powered Vehicles” - muscle -powered vehicles of all kinds are to be offered at the state exhibition opening in May 2001.
The palette extends from mountain bike to skates and borrowing to pedalos.Leupi: «We are still aiming for the entire selection of vehicles, even if this has not yet been determined due to some missing partners."Only the SBB -" The largest bike rental company in Switzerland " - are set as a partner.
The HPM project must be set in detail by the HPM project by mid-March.According to the coarse concept, the aim of the HPM project is that expo visitors go from one place to the other with their own strength.
For this purpose, the artplages are connected by a network of routes for bicycles, skates and boats.And: "People should also look at other sights in the region by bike," continued the project manager.The HPM project mainly refers to the three-sea region between Biel, Yverdon and Murten.
Leupi, who is supported in Olten by Markus Capirone, Marianne Frei and various other employees ("Together we share 200 job percent"), but not only focuses on this area: «We want to intercept people in Olten, Solothurn and LausanneAnd motivate you for our project."The Expo visit can already begin here, not least because of the" favorable accommodation options in the canton ".
Further advantages, such as the attractive landscape or the well-suitable bike route of the Aare for families, would have to be communicated even better by the canton, Leupi notes. "If the relevant concerns come, we will also support them," says the cantonal expo-Coordinator Rolf Maegli.He also finds the local bike paths "fantastic".Para-hotel industry can benefit from this.
So far, little has changed in the canton of Solothurn regarding HPM.The only one is in contact with Grenchen, says Leupi.There, however, he is “confident” that the links and improvements to local bicycle traffic are going well.
The bicycle paths are also to be expanded around 15 kilometers in Biel until Expo.01.Leupi: «In the local transport area of the Expo cities, it is our goal that around 30 percent of the residents drive to the exhibition with the bike.»Today the proportion of bicycle city population is around 10 percent on average.
New services «how can and can the bike also need the bike in everyday life?»Is the HPM topic for Biel an der Expo.01 (see box).So that as many citizens as possible understand the bicycle as something everyday, today - analogous to the garage or service offer for cars - services are also required perfectly tailored to bicycles.Leupi: «People are getting used to it.»
However, because today's offer often leaves something to be desired, the Velobüro is planning various improvements throughout the Expo area.This includes, for example, setting up showers and lockable subjects for larger bike parking spaces or the offer of express repairs - also on weekends.One more word about the major events with which Expo visitors are to be made tasty in a playful way.
"In order to connect the ARTEPLAGES HPM-Like, we are planning one or two car-free adventure days," says Leupi.A car -free adventure day should also take place in 2000 and further after 2001 - a good proof of the idea of sustainability that is very important at the Expo.With an attractive bike route network as possible, the Velobüro Olten wants to awaken the desire to move around with its own muscle strength with the Expo visitors.

Ingenious invention: Skid trainer - sling slope in small format / / Veltheim AG - New GAG at the Geneva automotive salon: Thanks to the help of a ingenious inventor, the Veltheim traffic safety center can simulate on the model, which is actually going on on the large sling slope.
Skid coach is called the almost five-meter-long spin slope.As in real life, a test person can spin over the slopes by car.The only difference: the vehicle is remotely controlled and on a scale 1:10.
The model is moved via a normal steering wheel.A swimming angle sensor indicates when the model car is losing without a radiant, i.e. out of control.Then the simulator breaks off.
This corresponds to an abortion in Veltheim when the instructor calls: "Block brakes immediately, no longer fight!" Inventor and builder of the skid coach is Ruedi Binder.As a driving instructor, a qualified Veltheim instructor, a trained mechanic and passionate aircraft, car and ship model maker, he brought the right specialist knowledge and the necessary manual skill.At the stand of the VSZ Veltheim (Hall 4), the car salon visitors have the opportunity to be on the "black ice" every day.

The IG Velo launches a city brevet / / If you are fighting through the city successfully on a bike course, the new city brevet will be sure.· Hans Peter Rothab In early June, cyclists in the city can now earn a city brevet.

"Posting" by Bern "We would like to sensitize the bikers to traffic measures that affect them," explains, "explains,"Daniel Bachofner, secretary of IG Velo Bern.
On two different courses through the city, the Brevet candidates encounter good and poor examples of traffic measures.The courses work like a power run.The material for this consists of a city map with the marked items, a sheet to comment on it, and a stamp card that can be stamped as "evidence" at the next SVB stop.

Veltheim Skid coach at the Geneva automotive salon / / MST.On the model to show what happens on the large sling slope in Veltheim has become a reality.
Thanks to the help of a inventor, the old idea could finally be implemented and is specified for the first time under the audience participation at the Geneva Salon.The test person has to drive through an obstacle course on a “spin slope”, which is almost five meters long.Mixing tires is simulated on the remote -controlled model of a Toyota Celica GT on a scale of 1:10, which promotes spinning, just like in real training.
The vehicle is checked via a normal steering wheel and can be “driven” in five different speed levels.If the Celica breaks so far that it can no longer be collected, this is displayed by a so -called swimming angle sensor.The test breaks off.
This corresponds to the demolition of the exercise in Veltheim when the instructor calls: «Block immediately, do not fight on!»Of course, a Veltheim instructor is also available on the cars, which offers test subjects the necessary explanations and assistance.The inventor and builder, Ruedi Binder, is a qualified Veltheim instructor and leads its own driving school.
During the almost two-year development phase, he was able to contribute his everyday experiences from the anti-talented trainings as well as his specialist knowledge as a trained mechanic and passionate aircraft, car and ship model manufacturer.The competition on the skid trainer is fun.The device is at the stand of the VSZ Veltheim in Hall 4.

Velos as a tax killer?/ / Companies that actively promote the use of the bike with their employees should pay less tax."No," says the government council to the concerns brought by Grand councilor Margrith Göldi Hofbauer (GB / Bern) by motion.
Bruno Utzder Use of Velos as a means of transport in everyday life is profitable for everyone, writes the motionärin.The advantages for companies are justified by the fact that bicycle commuters get into traffic jams less and they need only a little parking space for their vehicle in the company.The internal work traffic can also be mastered with the bike time -saving and environmentally friendly.
Margrith Göldi Hofbauer continues: "Bike is also health -promoting, and healthy people are less lacking in the workplace.»Specifically, Göldi Hofbauer leads the free delivery of Velos to workers, company bikes, changing rooms and showers as tax -worthy points.A Göldi Hofbauer, which has resigned from the Grand Council, continues to have had a major impact on tax reliefs in Holland in several ways.
Not permitted "yes, the use of the bike can bring different advantages," says the government council, the Motionärin's view.Companies that made the corresponding infrastructure available to their staff could debits the costs as tax -effective effort.Additional incentives for tax deductions could, however, lead to certain expenses items could even be deducted twice.
"Such a privilege would object to a principle of direct taxes anchored in the cantonal constitution and would not be permitted even according to the federal law on the harmonization of direct taxes of the cantons and communities."Council to reject the motion.The government council still underpins its no with the indication that bicycles benefited from the existing streets, but would not be taxed: "In contrast to the cars and ships".And last but not least, the government response said that the required tax funding is indirect subsidization according to the casting can principle and thus inefficient use of financial resources.

Integration, instead of separate bicycle paths / / integrating it now means for bike in city traffic.This also includes roundabouts.
The following also applies to bike: integration instead of segregation.The new philosophy is now to be promoted in Biel."Cyclists do not want to go on side streets, but drive on the cantonal roads," says construction director Ueli Haag, describing the new thrust.
The cohabitation between bicycles and cars does not only arise from the guesto of the cyclists to use as direct connections as possible.Rather, separate bike paths can be dangerous for their users.The reason is, among other things, confluence with car breeds.
This experience can understand who is forbidden on the avenue on the seaside suburb.Haag now wants to incorporate more and more integration aids into the normal road network.For example, the bike sac, which allows cyclists to place in front of the automotiveists in red light and thus continue to drive in their respective direction.
Further milestones for safer bicycle traffic are the roundabouts created in recent years.Especially if you do not exceed 30 m outer diameter, increase the safety of road users, because you reduce the speed of the cars, press down at bike speed if the geometry is right.However, roundabouts are only safer for cyclists if they behave integratively and prevent the cars from driving in the middle of the road.
Alexandre Luczy, traffic engineer of the city of Biel, has created an accident statistics, each of which records the situation before and after the construction of the roundabout.In general, it is striking that the property damage incurred decreases.Luczy: "The accidents in the roundabout are much lighter than with conventional intersections." However, the roundabout deviates from this positive balance on the pianoplatz.
Here the damage even increased during the first four years until the roundabout was rebuilt in 1997.Because roundabout only increase traffic safety if the road width and geometry are correct if the vehicles are really redirected into a curve by the construction of the roundabout.At the pianoplatz, the cars were originally able to rap practically unchecked.
Since the road construction projects at Jürg Stähli, the person responsible for bike in the city planning office, have to be avoided, such accidents have been avoided from the outset.The latest example: the roundabout Moser / Aebi / Gurnigelstrasse.Stähli: «In the first variant, the cyclists would have to be driven onto the BTI rails in much too pointed angles.

This went too far for the government because "the consequences of the cost would be considerable" (more than CHF 1 million).Therefore, the Grand Council Rejection of the Motion is requested in the main points (wheel strips, gyro building).The construction of a protective island in front of the Loueli underpass, on the other hand, is advocated.

"Millions" in Veloland / / "Veloland Switzerland" can look back on a successful first season.The national bicycle paths are used lively, are worthwhile and are usually judged as well. 3,3 million bike tourists were on the “Veloland Switzerland” foundation in 1998.This tourism is also worthwhile:
In advance in the form of transports in public transport (public transport), overnight stays and food, these cyclists issued CHF 110 million according to the foundation.The use of public transport is also gratifying: 4 out of 5 holiday travelers use the public transport at some point.And: 90 % of the customers are “satisfied to enthusiastic” - this picture gives the almost 300 letters.
What do the cantons pay?So that positive balance sheets can continue to be drawn, the project management - the Velobüro in Olten - takes on efforts to promote quality.Routes and signaling are regularly checked and danger spots are collected.
Any structural measures are to be submitted to cantonal specialist agencies.However, it is still unclear how far cantons and communities will participate in the proposed work.The most prominent route in the region has been the Aare bike hiking trail since 1993, which last year became part of the “Veloland Switzerland” route network.
Today the national routes 5 and 8 of the Aare lead: the former as "Mittelland route", as the "Aare route" the latter.For more ambitious “bikers”, the two hillier cantonal cycle hiking trails are recommended.One leads from Büren a.A. through the Bucheggberg and the Wasseramt to Graben, where it flows into the national paths.

Safe Velowege in and for Bern: With good will it goes / / BZ from June 21, “On the way with the Velo” I would like to recommend Urs Gloor, head of traffic planning in the Bern city planning office, to drive to Oldenburgto rent a bike there.

With such an experience in the head, Mr. Gloor could plan a very different way in Bern.With good will it is possible to create safe bicycle paths in and around Bern.The many wide sidewalk invites you to see how it works elsewhere.
I cannot imagine that Mr. Gloor uses the Bernese bike strips in the middle of traffic.Brigitte Schwaufstorf

The best times of bike are over / / "Nowhere in the canton of Zurich are more bicycles stolen than in Winterthur. Nevertheless, the city police are getting fewer and fewer theft ads.
Roger Kellerim Kanton Zurich reported 11,900 Velodiebstehle last year.That is 33 a day.1817 advertisements were in Winterthur - in relation to the population almost twice as many as in Zurich.
This is not astonishing: in Winterthur it is far more pleasant to drive bike than in Zurich.And where more bicycles circulate, there is also more to steal.
Other numbers are more astonishing.Around 40 percent came back ten years ago in Winterthur significantly more bicycles were reported than stolen, namely in 2345. Since the total number of bicycles has increased in the same period rather than fell, there are only reasons for this decline:
"" We have the impression that the bicycles are better completed today than before, "says city police spokesman Peter Gull.However, both unsecured and secured two -wheelers are stolen, from three -way to mountain bike."" No castle is 100 % safe, "says Gull.
Nevertheless, he advises to park and secure the bicycles in bike rooms or in the Bicycle Central Station.Gull: "" Anyone who runs away with a bike with a ironing lock on their shoulders stands out. "" So the best times of bike thieves seem to be over.However, Gull does not rule out that some bike thiefs are no longer reported - because there are now cheap bikes, which the activities for the owners do not be worthwhile, and because many bicycles are no longer automatically included in the furniture insurance.
The city police make some efforts to help the legal owners to help them again: Every month, the vehicle search systematically searches for stolen bicycles.And practically daily, Ernst Gutherz collects abandoned two -wheelers due to reports from the population:
It is considered to be a VIP - as "" Veloiipacker "". According to Gull, around 40 percent of the stolen reported bicycles come back to their owners.The assignment has been practically impossible since the abolition of the bicycles, where the owners have not kept the framework or vignette number.The city police hand over stolen bicycles that cannot be conveyed after 120 days.
Nevertheless, thieves have little to fear: only 1.6 percent of the bike thiefs are informed across the canton.PICTURE

Successful first season / / The “Veloland Switzerland” offer, opened by Federal Councilor Adolf Ogi in May 1998, passed the test.The statistical figures (they were levied on a random and calculated on 16 days) speak of 3.3 million bike tourists who vomited 150 million kilometers on the network in 1998.
Around 120,000 cyclists were on the road for several days and booked a total of 340,000 nights, of which 150,000 are omitted on hotels.Overall, bike tourists - whether holiday travelers or day trippers - consumed CHF 110 million.If you collect the expenses for transport (public transport) and meals, cyclists, if they are on the road for more than one day, spend an average of CHF 150 a day.
In the case of day trips, the sum is reduced to CHF 20.Almost 70 km are usually driven per day.From the nine routes of the Veloland Switzerland network, the Rheinroute is the most popular.hle

Veloplausch and Crosscountry at the weekend / / two years ago, the founder and “father” of the Veloplausch of TV Meinisberg, Kurt Oppliger, withdrew from responsibility.After he had looked after this enjoyable bike pass for 25 years, he passed the management to his son Oliver and his gymnastics colleague Reto Wälti.
Actually, opplier wanted to give himself a little quieter times through this step.These have just taken two years now, because this summer he will take a new project to the public: parallel to the Veloplausch, the next Saturday and Sunday, August 28th and 29th, in the usual way with a digestible route and attractive game postWith a new 6-member OK for Sunday, he launched and put out the 1st Meinisberger Mountainbike Cross-Country trophy.For nine different categories (from schoolchildren about juniors, women, men, seniors and veterans), this has stained a racetrack depending on the category 8 to 20 km long in the Büttenbergwald.
The authorities brought up a lot of understanding of this project.By accommodating the community, the start and finish could be created in the center of the village with a temporary traffic blocking of municipal roads.And with the consent of the burger community, forest paths are available that guarantee the driver and the audience an attractive sports event

If something comes, you have been a mud / / "There have been bicycle in Zurich for ten years. They are the last really free road users.
Christian Hubschmidman can only say it pathetically to put it to the point: bike embody freedom and adventure that they no longer exist on the streets.In daring maneuvers, they sit over law and law and only accept a rule:
Time is money .Leave the radio in front of your chest casually when you walk through the glass door through the glass door on the lightning blanks and balanced the backpack off your shoulder, while the bike is waiting outside, in undulating like a cowboy horse.Envied of the public transport users in their creeping trams, hated by the drivers in their tinny prisons, they whiz all their ears and put their lives at risk.
Freedom is where the risk is: in the middle of the street.Bicycles have been banging through Zurich for ten years.The Veloblitz was the first in 1989, today there are four small businesses, the Traffic Jam, Kurier AG and the Flash Delivery, and there is at least one bicycle in almost any other Swiss city.
The "" Blitz "" is still the greatest pure bicycle, he employs 65 people;According to the managing director Markus Sulger, his sales should exceed the 2 million border for the first time this year.When Samuel Iseli ignited from the kitchen of his flat share from the Veloblitz ten years ago, the ecobonus was probably an equally good start -up aid as the CHF 10,000 from the father and a bank.
At that time it was in green and alternative, and under the styled advertising rims it was soon considered chic to rush the sweaty romper from Hochglanzoffice to the designer office.The bicycles were the good ones that were committed with a mixture of admiration and pity, at least as long as the pity did not prevail, because in the event of rain and snow, according to Sulger, there were practically no orders at the time.It's different today.
Today the couriers are also required when cats hail.Firstly, you saw that you do not consider yourself, and secondly, the pity has evaporated.Today, the bikers are considered "" strassenrowdys "", who ride the image of all cyclists.
On the popularity scale of all road users, for example, they come from razors and manta drivers, and far behind the skaters and the occasional bike drivers of old school.It is the latter that endanger the pedestrians on their rickety three-speed ladies, and not the "" Bikemaniacs "", which, firstly, are hardly ever on the sidewalk because they do not go forward, and secondly drive so wellthat they can avoid.Each "" Veloblitz "" receives a leaflet when it is employment.
It says: "" Fuses you have to be held by footmaster. "" Consideration for the pedestrians has a top priority, says Markus Sulger.Compared to the drivers, however, the bicycle are the weaker.That is why all maneuvers are allowed on the street, be they so daring.
Basically, it is driven in the middle of the street, where it is the safest.Particular caution is advised to overtake trams on the left, because "" if something comes, you are mud!"", it says in the way management.
Accidents are rare, says Markus Sulger.There were only two serious accidents in the history of the Veloblitz.What gets on the nerves of many drivers are the disregard for the traffic rules.
"" You will notice that there are certain traffic rules that, depending on the situation, prove to be extremely unfavorable or even senseless "," is diplomatic in the way of line, but clearly.The police distribute few buses.There are "so phases", says Sulger, where the controls become more systematic, but as soon as a courier has discovered control, he warns the others.
In the urban area, the bicycles today cover an estimated three quarters of all courier orders.For a program from Seefeld to Albisriederplatz, a client must expect a period of half an hour and costs of CHF 18.The "" bike flash "" drive on sales participation, the men get 39 percent, the women, almost none of whom has, 44 percent.
Above all, routine is needed to get a right wage, says Markus Sulger.Everyone has to train the fitness, including a racing driver, because the Stop-and-Go driving of the bicycle bike is unusual.In a five -hour layer, a courier traces 40 to 60 kilometers.
On average, a driver stays with the "" Blitz "" "for one and a half years, after which he burned down." "At some point you have to stop," says Markus Sulger.The daily fight in traffic is a kick, something that can make you as addicted as a computer game, but at some point "you can no longer see it".All written documents and pictures are probably a historical appearance, because if the Internet is used as a transport channel for photographs, it is no longer needed.For the time being, however, the Veloblitz still has growth of ten percent a year.

Six solutions for the bike / / / "We know six different forms of leading bike transport," explains Oskar Balsiger, head of the cantonal department of Velo.Which solution comes into play depend on the respective circumstances:
· In the “independent leadership”, bicycle traffic is guided over a separate street regardless of the cantonal road.Example in the Oberaargau
: Bike path between Lotzwil and Madiswil.· The “separated” bike path is classic: a green strip separates it from the road for motorized traffic.
The round, blue signal panel indicates that cyclists are obliged to use the bike path.In the Oberaargau, the route between Roggwil and Langenthal is equipped with such a bike path.·
During the “joint leadership”, cyclists and motorized traffic use the same roadway.For bicycles, a trace is divided using a line or a special covering.Cars and trucks must not hinder cyclists on the strip.
Bicycle drivers can switch to the road for overtaking maneuvers if they observe the course rules.· The canton of Bern has developed a specialty for school children and cyclists who feel uncertain in traffic:
In the “individual leadership”, they are allowed to use a footpath or a sidewalk (example: Langenthaler Bützbergstrasse).If you are traveling with the racing bike or the moped, you can use the road.·
The "selective solution" is used on less busy routes.Example: a bike creep track in a slope.This is only created one -sided, since on the other side in the departure the cyclists swim in traffic and reach too high speed for a narrow track.

The canton of Bern has had a “guiding principle bike” for more security / / since November - a reason to inquire about what will be improved in the region for bicycle traffic in the future.Several wheel strips are planned.
Bike paths, on the other hand, seem to be passé.Daniel Haller «The canton of Bern is bike -friendly!»With this sentence - including an exclamation mark - the“ Missionum Velo ”of the canton, which was adopted in November, begins.
He expressed a good will to equate the environmentally friendly means of transport with the other types of traffic, to increase the number of bicycle trips and reduce those of accidents, but is limited from the start by the framework: "Expertise of the existing scope of action". "We have to renovate a street, we think about whether one could also improve the conditions for bike transport, »Oskar Balsiger, head of the Velo of the cantonal civil engineering office, specifies.Velo projects in the regional past, new projects would be particularly suitable if there are obviously dangerous routes or statistically proven accidental areas of the accident.The financial ceiling is extremely short for new projects.
It will therefore not be easy for concerned parents in the future to strive for a bike path for their children's way.But at least there are currently several bicycle projects in the region or under construction: · bike strips in both directions on the old Bern-Zürichstrasse between Bützberg and Herzogenbuchsee is about to be completed.·
The Langenthal - Bleienbach bike strips are planned, there were no objections.If the Grand Council decides to finance this year, it could be usable in 2004.·
The plans will be launched in the coming week for the wheel strip between Höchenetten and St. Niklaus (coupled).Running plan approval, financing and construction optimal, so it will be operational from 2004.·
At the Jura South Foot between Oensingen and Solothurn, bicycle traffic is to be managed independently of existing side streets."There are still problems to solve," explains Balsiger.So the new route should not contain long detours, otherwise it is only used by bike tourists, but not by the commuters.
Cycle path or strip?In contrast to the past, when the bike path was preferred separately from the road, the new projects are mostly wheel strips.«Cycle paths are more difficult to keep dirty and snow clean.
In order to really get a bike path, you need a lot more salt, as the autopneus release warmth to the road and help with the snow removal, »he explains.In addition, a cycle path had to be under -kissed as much as the rest of the street: agricultural vehicles with its high axle pressure cross it and would otherwise destroy it.
But security considerations also speak for the bike strip: «On the bike path, the cyclist feels more relaxed, but any cross -traffic is all the more dangerous.And the confluence on the road at the end of the cycle path has often proven to be a focus of the accident, »explains Balsiger.While the Bützberg - Herzogenbuchsee is still being built in the Bathwald on the bike strip on the bike strip, it can already be accessed to the edge of the forest.

The Langer Leidenweg / / The central square's cycle route is the last stumbling block for bike drivers who want to cross the city as safely as possible.Otherwise, the Veloroute See-Länggasse approaches its perfection.
It took long enough!Samia Guemeibiel.So far, Biel is Brachland.
At least for the cyclists, even more precisely for the bike pandering drivers.Because Biel is a black hole on the cantonal and national bicycle cards.Inexistent.
It could be different for 13 years.Or almost, at least.Because in 1987 the vocal cord approved a framework loan for a bicycle -friendly Biel over six million francs.
In 1989 the corresponding structure plan was available.With its concrete implementation, however, it was a problem.In 1995 the city council dismissed a first loan template See-Länggasse.
As the bike commission stated, the bike loan also advised measures that primarily benefited the car traffic.Finally, it worked in November of the same year.The city council gave its consent to 22 individual measures.
The loan amounted to around CHF 2.5 million.And today ?In the past few months, the civil engineering office has intervened six times in favor of the cyclists, namely as follows: · Lower Quai Süd (section Landtestrasse-Neuhausstrasse): Opening for two-wheelers in both directions.
· Hauserwehr: New two-wheeler and pedestrian bridge.· Intersection Hallerstrasse / Spitalstrasse: safe traffic routing through Middle island (provisional).· Upper Quai Süd (section Neumarktstrasse-Centralplatz): Opening for two-wheelers.
· Stämpflistrasse (section Hauserwehr-Omegaplatz): New wheel strips on both sides.· Intersection Kirchenfeldweg / Bürenstrasse: secure transition using an early stop area.
· Länggasse (Höhe Kirchenfeldweg): New Middle Island as a crossing aid.But for a continuous south-north axis of the city, the cyclists still lack various points: · crossing the central square in all directions.However, this measure can only be realized with the new space design.
· Upper Quai (between Jura and Neumarktstrasse): Opening for two-wheelers.If this last measure is realized, the whole schüss between Hauserwehr to the lake can be driven south side by the cyclists.
This is a renewal compared to the original structure plan, which would have planned to lead the bike transport north on the north of the Schüss, towards Bözingen, but south -sided."The new concept has the advantage that cyclists can move freely in the city," explains Jürg Stähli from the response point for bike issues of the city of Biel, "because one -way traffic significantly limits freedom."Bike drivers are open in both directions are not dangerous for cyclists, says Stähli, because the different road users have a view of each other.Something that only supports the IG Velo Biel-Seeland to a limited extent.
Board member Gabriella Bollliger: «The opening for two -wheeler traffic would have to be better marked, otherwise drivers will show you the bird!"Stähli, on the other hand, says:" Over time and due to upgrade VELO pictograms, drivers will get used to the fact that many one-way streets are open to bike traffic!»Biel's path to regional recognition as a Velowanderstadt is not too long.
The correct signage will soon be missing for the crowning glory.The IG Velo is a special concern.Bolliger: «It should be a signaling that Biel is really attractive as a bike city

Velovignettes are only free for students / / only pupils who live in Spiez get a velovignette for free.However, this decision of the Spiezer Parliament is subject to the optional referendum.
On February 28, the Spiezer municipal council had applied to the parliament that the velovignettes could no longer be given free of charge.With 17 to 14 votes, the large municipal council (GGR) briefly rejected the business at the time (the BZ reported). At Monday evening, the parliamentarians had to deal with the agendaism again.The municipal council had revised the template and proposed to fundamentally abolish the free of charge of the bike to the end of the year.
However, all students living in the municipality of Spiez continue to receive a free vignette annually."With the money saved, the account of 'traffic -assuring measures' is to be increased," said municipal councilor Bernhard Abbühl.No special financing of the revised template generally met with positive response.
"In this form we can agree to the abolition of the free vignettes," emphasized Elisabeth Glaus (Free Spiez).Only the question arose, which is why no separate Kässeli could be created for the money saved."That would be too much administrative effort for the relatively low amount," said Bernhard Abbühl.
With 33 to 0 votes (one abstention), the large municipal council supported the abolition of the free vignettes.It was decided to increase the account “traffic assurance measures” to 60,000 francs annually.MMT

The bike claw as a year -round sport / / regularly disappears in the canton of Solothurn well over 2000 bicycles every year: in August Warens 270.
The city is also the city, mainly the suburb.Are the bicycles only “loan” for the journey home?Or even organized abroad, as one -way dealer suspects?
Fabian Schäferer lets the wrench slide through the hand again and again."Junge and Junkies," he says, looking at the damaged bike next to him.Most of the time, it is young and junkies who come to him with old bicycles, once or twice a month - with bike, from which he prefers to keep his fingers.
René Hauser's workshop for bicycles and Motos is optimally located, at the Rossmarktplatz, slightly away from the Velo-Klau epicenter: "At the post office, around the train station, basically in the suburb," Fritz Zimmermann sketches the room for two-wheeler parkers.And the vice commander of the city police also locates the delicate season: the warm summer months.
"Who drives bike when it rains." Velo deliveries abroad ... so cyclists: avoid the train station, and for the warm months, buy a summer lock that should not be cracked.Because the numbers also underpin Zimmermann's experience: The pillars of the bike love statistics on the homepage of the cantonal police are growing steadily from February:
At that time, 110, in March 190, 210 in April, then 284 in May and June finally, this year, 338. After a break -in in July (181), 270 again in August - and these are just the reported thefts.If you take the previous year's figures to help, the falling interest in two -wheelers standing around for the autumn months can be predicted. ”Before the summer vacation, there are always a lot of customers who have been stolen a new bike.»
Here in the small workshop of Heinz Brumann, in front of the window the used bikes are lined up, Zimmermann's weather thesis seems to be confirmed.But the man in the mechanic's grapes draws a different conclusion than that in uniform: Since new bicycles in particular come away before the summer vacation, and he has been observing that for years, he suspects that these are often brought home by foreigners.
An adventurous thesis apparently, but it is also supported by René Hauser: he himself knew one who stole some bicycles and then brought abroad.«Here in the city a stolen, new bike would be a great risk.»
Although, he adds, even a reported bike can be easily manipulated thanks to the new vignette system, so that it could not be recognized again ... or just indifference?Fritz Zimmermann gets it: «I often have the feeling that people have too much money.»
There are no theories about foreign deliveries for him, for him the main reason for the hundreds of characters of stolen cyclists is determined: «Most of the bicycles are not completed.»It also agreed with the cantonal police:
"Today there is indifference," states Walter Borner.Hehlei (toilet and resale) always exists, he knows, and there is also the possibility that larger quantities came abroad, but he knows no signs of commercial organization - and finally there were really many bike, he emphasizes again."There is no search" Walter Borner is at the Kapo employee in the vehicle investigation department.
He has little gratifying to report: of the officially 2716 bicycles who found the involuntary path in strange hands last year (unofficially: "The number of unreported cases is probably very high"), 632 bicycles have reappeared - not even every fourth.No wonder: "There is no search for stolen bicycles," says Borner openly.
That is also not the mandate of the Kapo.Nevertheless: He would like to ask all bike holders to remember the frame and vignette number and specify if necessary.In any case, the one, whose bike is reported by an irritated housekeeper or shopkeeper of the police and passed on to the detector (see box). Who would have not reported this luck, but did not report the theft because the insurance - which requires an advertisement- Nothing pays anyway, he may be able to meet his bike at a dealer:
Missed bicycles, which are not registered as stolen, sells the cantonal police to a bike dealer after one month."But the interest in this bike is small," he explains: usually you still have to pay for the disposal.

Bicycle traffic should double / / Today Christof Bähler starts his new 100 percent position.The long-time Vice President of IG Velo Bern takes over the newly created department for promoting foot and bike.
· Pascal Schwendener "IG Ha Keis Outo", says Christof Bähler.For him in the city, the bike is the ideal means of transport par excellence, says the 35-year-old, who today receives his office at the department for promoting bicycle and pedestrian traffic.Bähler estimates that he traces 90 percent of all his ways with the two -wheeler.
«So I drive comfortably from door to door, don't have to worry about traffic jams and parking problems and do something for my health."The engineer wants to work on the newly created department that as many Bernese as possible will follow his example in the future." There is potential, "says Bähler.Just under ten percent of all ways that are undertaken in Bern would be covered on the bike.
That should change.The ambitious goal of the urban planning office: the doubling of Stadtberner bicycle traffic over the next ten years.Ten -year planned millions of CHFs are available to the promotion of foot and bike transport until 2011 - 40 million in total.
This is not new expenses, but only a relocation in the traffic sector.22 million are planned in the execution plan for “light two -wheeler traffic”.As Christof Bähler explains, structural measures for foot and bicycle traffic should always be implemented where it is already being built.
"If a street is torn open to renovate plant management, we will implement improvements for cyclists and pedestrians at the same point," he says.«By using such synergies, we keep the construction costs deep.»Wherever possible, the paths for the weakest road users should become shorter and safer.
Specifically: street traces should be made more bike -friendly for “environmental traces” for public transport and cyclists or crossings.Excellent specialist
Bähler knows the concerns of pedestrians and cyclists like no other.He has been a member of IG Velo Bern since 1992, since 1995 he has been on its board and since 1997 one of the IG Vice President.City planner Jürg Sulzer praises his new employee as a "excellent specialist".
And indeed: Christof Bähler has followed his training as a civil engineer to study in environmental technology, which he concluded with the diploma thesis “Cost-benefit comparison of integral bicycle funding in Bern”.Already in an earlier diploma thesis, he had dealt with traffic in the federal city.Despite these references, Bähler is “amazed” about his choice:
"It is not a matter of course that a bicycle fanatic comes to such a place," he smiles.“But ultimately everyone benefits when cycling is increasingly being ripped.The drivers also enjoy more space, clean air and less noise. »More bicycles do not only make fun everywhere - even Bähler not.
"The parking situation at the train station, for example, has to be tackled," he says.Solutions related to the station redesign are currently being discussed.As soon as the government has decided which measures are to be implemented to promote the bike this year, Bähler wants to inform about it.

Hard struggle for bicycle policy / / "Hart struggle for bike policy MEK." A lot has been achieved in the past 25 years, "said Grand Councilor and IG Velo board member Anita Lachemneier on the panel discussion on the subject of" step back or progress in Basel Veloverkehr?" on Tuesday .
Only many bike routes had been torn open, the situation had worsened.An example is the Bangstrasse, which was previously normal.«Today parked cars stand there on both sides, for two -wheelers it is a slalom ride.»
"Not the best solution" reason for removing the bike marking in Sperrstrasse, according to Peter Huber, head of department and traffic in the building construction and planning office, is the introduction of the Tempo 30 zone: «The cars parked on both sides are at the expense of bike stripnecessary to contain the speed.Drivers have to notice that they are in a Tempo 30 zone.»However, he was aware of the problem that arises for the cyclists.
There are no bicycles in the Tempo 30 zones, which were limited to main traffic routes, said Huber.“This is certainly not the best solution for bike rides and cyclists, but if you look at the entire traffic, it makes sense.»In the case of Tempo 30 zones, Andreas Brenner, head of the traffic department of the police and military department, also speaks of a hermaphrodite solution.
“However, not only the narrowed streets, but also regular speed controls ensure that the limit is observed."" It seems to me that so far only the simple bike measures have been implemented, "said IG board member and Grand Councilor Lukas Stutz.So far, 117 out of 140 kilometers of the planned bike route network have been realized, 16 kilometers are being processed.
«However, we lack a Veloparking concept for the city, for example.»But the VeloCredit of 25 million is almost used up."A new loan application is in preparation," Huber reassured.
Around 9.8 million of the old loan are still available.This is particularly financed by Euroville Veloparking.Improvements are also planned in St. Jakobs-Strasse, Riehenstrasse and in the Dorenbach district.
That can still be done with the remaining money."You have to be able to cycle throughout the city," said Lachenmeier.However, this is hardly possible:
Many bicycle paths are not consistently and often interrupted at dangerous crossings."We are on closing the holes on the net," replied Huber, pointing out: "Many gaps are related to larger construction measures, since the route for bicycles is recently defined.»
A bike path improved the situation in the CiaraRastrasse, which is difficult to drive today.Greifengasse, Faiknerstrasse and Klybeckstrasse would also be designed in such a way that everyone can get past each other.Even in detail, one tries for more security:
"At the Riehenring, for example, we have chaste the overnights to the street to avoid accidents," said Jörg Jantz, head of the projects in the Transport Buildings division.Handling festivals for bike paths?When the discussion was opened for everyone, the approximately 80 present stormed the official representatives with many questions and suggestions:
For example, the question was asked when the middle bridge was finally becoming car -free."In July, the bridge panel will be renovated," said Huber.Then the bridge for the cars was closed:
«We will then see where the traffic chaos breaks out.If everything goes well, it is possible that the bridge becomes car -free.»The question was also asked what the government generally had for goals.
"The traffic plan will be sent in the next few days," Huber said.The government council also wanted to promote the needs of slow traffic.However, propaganda is increasingly necessary for the bike: "You also make inauguration festivals for new bicycle paths as with new tram lines," Anita Lachenmeier suggested an idea that Huber wants to implement in the future.

Cyclists criticize cycling plans / / / The Stadtbahn Glattal will force cyclists to get off.
The IG Velo defends itself against this.The light rail, which is built between 2006 and 2010 and Zurich is to connect to Kloten, Opfikon, Valaisellen and Dübendorf, crossed by Liliane Minor.An obstacle to bike: If you want to behave correctly, you have to descend and push your wheel over the street and rail.
“Scandalous and discriminatory” is that, says Daniel Leupi from IG Velo.Because, according to the execution plan, regional bike routes must allow the most smooth journey possible.The IG has now lodged a complaint against the interruptions in the bike routes as part of the planned edition of the Stadtbahn.
Above all, she criticizes the canton: the cantonal police prevented a more bike -friendly solution.The Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG) originally planned, which build and operate the light rail, to create bike strips in parallel to the pedestrian strips.Such so -called bikes are available in the city of Zurich at some intersections.
However, these fords are not intended in the federal signaling ordinance."That is why our plans would not have been approved," says VBG director Andreas Flury.The VBG was only one thing:
The pedestrian strips are created wide enough, so that if bike is allowed at some point, you can easily retrofit.The instructions of the Kapo that bike are not allowed came out last year - the city -wrinkled fords were therefore not illegally created.They are tolerated until a street is renovated anyway.
The IG Velo now requires that the canton of the federal government is committed to ensuring that bicycles are included in the signaling regulation."That would not be a problem," says Leupi."In any case, the change in the law regarding Inline-Skates was much more revolutionary than the introduction of bicycles." Plans and models exhibited Stadthaus Opfikon can be seen by June 21, with a exhibition on the Stadtbahn, with planned and models.

Positive balance sheet is encouraged to continue / / / The bicycle taxis operated during Expo.02 have been given a lot of sympathy and many passengers.Initiator Hans Ueli Köhli therefore wants to let Biel roll it next year.
With the success of the bike taxis, the initiator and manager Hans Ueli Köhli is more than satisfied: "We never expected this idea to take this idea," he says.The company will have generated around CHF 100,000 in turnover if the company started at the beginning of the Expo will be discontinued on October 26.Average 3000 trips were carried out each month.
Both passenger spaces were usually occupied.However, the idea of the passengers was much Biel's scouting.The opposite is the case :
"Bieler was against 80 percent of the customers," estimates Köhli.The majority of these would have requested the vehicle by phone: “Up to 100 calls per day were received in the headquarters.“That is why Hans Ueli Köhli is clear:
The bicycles should also roll through Biel next year."People encouraged us to do so," says Köhli.«You told us that you would like to have bicycle taxis available in the future.»
In 2003 the company is to be started at the beginning of spring.Charging on the electricity is to be used next year only five units.At present, twice as many bicycles are stationed in Biel.
There are six of them.The other four hang on the power grid for two to four hours to recharge the battery for the electric auxiliary engine.The range is 25 to 30 kilometers, depending on the slope and use of muscle strength.
The balance is also positive for the drivers."With 100 percent working hours, around CHF 3,500 plus tips were to be earned per month," says Köhli.The top result was 5000 francs and CHF 3,000.
But several of the 26 drivers were less about money than the ideals. "I am not dependent on the earnings," explains Jill Kauer with a smile.«It was just a very nice job that I will be missing.He enjoyed me and he enjoyed people.»
The Pedaline company made the vehicles available free of charge on the condition that they are traveling at least seven hours five days a week.The independent drivers have to deliver 10 percent of their income to Köhli."For insurance companies, repairs and so on," emphasizes.
«I don't want to make a lot of money with it.I am concerned with sustainability.»Ro

If you want to sell a bike, you will get over between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., set the sales price and come back between 2 and 4.30 p.m. to collect the sales price or your unpaved bike.The margin in favor of the organizers depends on the defined price, is at least ten francs.A question about the Velostadt Basel: What does she annoy as a cyclist in the city?
Urgent need for action is necessary at the train station.The new parking spaces under the passengerlle are only coming, the parking lot at the French train station has already been lifted, there are more parking spaces.What I generally miss in Basel are covered bicycle parking spaces, such as it is along the BLT line.
And on the street?There are still some gaps in the Veloweg network, especially at intersections, the good, clear traffic routing stops, which I regret.I also found that mistakes were made to convert to Tempo 30 streets:
In the Sarring Strasse, for example, confusing, offset parking was introduced, the bike tracks were lifted at the same time - these errors were recognized and reversed in retrospect in Sperrstrasse.This is important, because the Tempo 30 introductions must not cause deterioration for cyclists.Interview Marc Krebsstephan Wullschleger.

Requirement for car -free Langstrasse / / Ark.On Tuesday, the interest group (IG) Velo Zurich called for the opening of the Langstrasse in district 4 for bicycle traffic with an approved demonstration.Around 50 people took up the road section for half an hour and painted Velo pictograms on the asphalt with water-soluble color.
In order to emphasize its demands, the IG Velo launches a petition under the title "Now open the Langstrasse for the bike".The bike travelers have been waiting for an acceptable solution for 20 years, said IG Managing Director Dave Durner on request.So far, the Langstrasse in Circle 4 can only be legally used in one direction - from Badenerstrasse.
In the other direction, it is reserved for the buses of line 32, but is already heavily used by cyclists.This condition is not portable, said Durner.The relocation of through traffic to surrounding streets in the regional execution plan must finally be implemented.
Langstrasse should be reserved for bicycles, buses, taxis and vehicles from residents and supplements.At the President of the district association Aussersihl-Hhard, Max Künzig, IG Velo encounters approval with its demands.He has been propagating a ring -shaped one -way street around the Langstrasse for a long time.
According to Künzig, it should lead from Kanonengasse via Military Strasse, Schöneggstrasse and Feldstrasse to Stauffacherstrasse.The President of the Zurich 4 trade association, Erich Burri, has little pleasure in this request.The ring road is not an alternative because of the “journey around seven corners”, says the garage owner.
This does not guarantee the necessary capacity.He sees the problem in a "certain overgrowth" of bike;The cyclists take out so many freedoms that car traffic is partially hindered, Burri complains.
The responsible city councilor Martin Waser did not want to commit to solutions for the recognized problem on request.He hopes to be able to present alternatives to the current state within a useful period.Waser emphasized that the implementation always had in detail.

Velodiebstähle: On wheels, back on foot / / In summer more bicycles are stolen than in winter.
Basel is particularly affected.Among other things, this has to do with the proximity to the border: professional thieves smuggle the bikes to neighboring countries and sell them there.
Sometimes it even goes to Bosnia.Basel.On the bike it is pleasant in this heat, but as soon as you descend, the sweat only runs down.
That is why bike racks in front of swimming pools are currently among the most popular places to rise from the bike.But what a forced pleasure means for humans can be the end of the bike - or in other words: a new beginning with a new owner."Our border guard patrol find that most bicycles are stolen from swimming pools and tram end stations in summer," says Patrick Gantenbein, information chief border twach command Basel.
By Martina Rutschmann the most professional bike thieves are on the road with small vans.They hold where there are pretty foreign vehicles, invite them, scratch the frame number away, spray the bike with a different color and sell it in the area or in neighboring countries.Lately, however, people from the border guard have been able to observe a new phenomenon:
Velos, which are stolen in this way, should not only be smuggled across the border into Alsace or anywhere else, but to Eastern Europe.Thieves caught by chance «our people caught two thieves in flagranti within a short time.
In the last case, there were asylum seekers from the east in Basel who wanted to sell the stolen bicycles in Bosnia, »says Gantenbein.A few weeks ago, a border patrol caught a thief duo in Riehen."It wasn't even dark when the men tried to crack wheels that were connected to bike racks," says Gantenbein.
The problem is the evidence in cases like this.Because the bicycles have not yet been reported as stolen.And even if - until the corresponding data can be called up, it takes a while.
In addition, it is not part of the core business of the border patrols to make bike thieves.And: «Since the boundaries to France are no longer consistently occupied due to the narrow population, it is only possible to secure stewards by samples.“If one goes online, the case is passed on to the police as soon as the alleged thieves have been asked at the border.
"Most people either say that they have been given the bicycles, or they stand naive by pretending to be allowed to take bicycles around," said Gantenbein.Basel seems to be the paradise for bike: "We find a lot of bike steels in the Basel area," says Renata Tschudi from Winterthur Versicherung.
And her colleague Maurizio Ilona adds that far more bicycles disappear in the city center than in the Upper Basel area.This is also confirmed by Markus Melzl from the public prosecutor.While between 60 and 70 bicycles per week are usually reported in the city, there are currently over 100th Melzl:
«In summer, more and more bicycle steels are being reported than in autumn or winter.For a simple reason - when it is warm, more people are cycling. »Veloleichen in the Rheines applies to a distinction between two types of thieves:« The largest part steals a bike because no tram drives or the money for the taxi is missing.
Only a small part steals professionally, »says Melzl.But no one has yet been arrested by the professional thieves.So many more unprofessional has already been caught.
However, not in flagranti, but driving for traffic violations.Nevertheless: The chance to get his stolen bike back is small.Maybe you would do well to dive down the Rhine here and there:
Looking for a murder weapon, divers found over 20 bicycles there years ago.However, there is still no trace of the weapon.Corpse with spokes.
If you do not properly secure your bike from long fingers, you can sometimes find it on the bottom of the Rhine.Photo Tino Brinerbücklöser on the Safe Rut.They can be locked and consist of one temple: According to Thomas Triet from the shop for bike accessories “Veloplus”, ironing locks offer the safest protection against theft.
But other types are also considered certain: "Castles with straight keys are very good in terms of mechanical security, at least better than those with round keys, because they are easier to crack," said Triet.The number one showed tests that the “Abus Granit X Plus” Castle was.Sometimes a cable lock is enough:
If you only leave the bike in front of a shop.However, if the bike remains unattended for a long time, Triet advises a coarser castle, because: «Cable locks can be easily cracked with a bolt cutter.»Different the so -called tank cable locks that not only offer a lot of protection, but also have other advantages.
Triet: «You can carry her around your shoulder and better tie it around a post than ironing locks.»However, the safest method is to complete the bike twice, according to Triet.“Professionals are usually specialized in a castle type, as soon as they are dealing with different types, it will be difficult.

25 years of free ride for bicycles / / in the past 25 years, IG Velo has fought the way to bike in the city of Bern.Today, the interest group is fighting primarily against the poor image of the bicycle drivers.
· Pascal Schwendener 25 years ago there was no single bike strip in Bern.They were more dangerous than no marking at all, the traffic planners said when the newly founded IG Velo campaigned for more security on Bern's streets.However, the first bicycle spontas were not impressed by such answers and grabbed self -help.
Equipped with a saucepan full of yellow signal color, they moved out to turn on a safety strip in a night and fog campaign.In such cases, the buses, because of “attaching a signaling without an authorized authorization”, carried the collective in solidarity.Spontis are beamede of the IG Velo are over.
The IG Velo has grown to an impressive organization with over 3000 members of a few indispensable bicycles who were fed up with being pushed to the roadside.And it can look back on a considerable number of successes.Last but not least, bike strips were painted in Bern, crossings were made more bike -friendly, one -way streets and driving bans opened for bicycles or bike parking spaces created.
The 1991 interest group presented 250 suggestions for improvement that should make Bern “Veloparadies”.In the meantime, more than a third of it was implemented.And the “Light two -wheeler traffic” structure plan from 1995 will oblige the city to take further improvements.
A small, almost missionary group of VeloFreaks blends into a serious partner for the authorities and is now being involved in many important plans."We achieved the greatest success in this regard four years ago," says IG Managing Director Daniel Bachofner."At that time, the municipal specialist office for foot and bike traffic was also created on our initiative, which has a budget of CHF four million annually." Bern has not become Veloparadies until today.
But compared to other Swiss cities, the local bicycle funding is quite impressive.Despite steep streets and cobblestones, the bike has become number 1.Four out of five Bernese have one.
And if you don't just have your two -wheeler in the basement, you know that no vehicle is faster in the city than the good old bike.City vehicle
Number 1, if different Bernese streets are still quite dangerous for bike drivers, a lot has happened for security and comfort.The statistics clearly reflect this: 1070 were involved in around 400 bicycles in accidents.
In 1980 there were 300, in 1990 and last year 118. "About half of these accidents were caused by the cyclists themselves," says Hans-Martin Baumann from the city police."Apparently they are not better or worse than the other parties." The black sheep's grimaces make the bike drivers take care of road safety.
Every spring, at the beginning of the bike season, the discussion about the so -called Velorowdies broke out again.And when an old woman was surprised by a bicycle driver this summer and fatally injured the Aarebord when falling, the call was loud that the police had to be harder against the "Velo-Rambos".The victims on the street are the perpetrators on the sidewalk, the tenor was in the letters' letters.
Not without reason .All too often, bike drivers ride through the city without taking care of traffic rules and traffic safety;Transfer red lights, disregarded driving bans, lawns over pedestrian strips of bricks about sidewalk - without any respect and caution. "That is actually a problem," says Daniel Bachofner.
«Even if there are only a few individuals, they harm the image of the bike drivers enormously.»The IG therefore do the possible to train and sensitize the bikers;Starting with reconnaissance campaigns, through driving courses to design measures on the streets.
However, Bachofner believes that only a rethink in the increasingly close street space can actually bring permanent tension.The territorial thinking of pedestrians and cyclists must stop."Where it is reasonable, we propagate mixed traffic zones where pedestrians and bicycles use the same traffic area," says Bachofner.
This solution had proven itself well on the Kornhausplatz or in the Hirschengraben."Because", "said Bachofner," it forces all of the slow traffic participants to consider mutual consideration.»· Picture Daniel Fuchsvelorowdies regardless of passers -by:

Velo paths: 86 percent realized / / baz / gs.The bicycle and moped meal network, as it was decided in 1988, is slowly growing towards its completion.
With a planned length of 140 kilometers, around 120 kilometers were realized at the end of 2002 and another twelve kilometers are being processed.The government council records this in its annual report on the status of realizing the bike and moped paths.Some of the sections that have not yet been realized are related to the north tangent and are therefore also tied to their construction.
For cost reasons, further sections can only be realized in the context of total renovations of the relevant streets.This applies, for example, to the Margarethenbrücke, Burgfelderstrasse or the Elsässerstrasse between Lichtstrasse and border, as Barbara Auer, Department of Transport and Transport in the Building Construction and Planning Office.In 2002, CHF 2.1 million were spent on the bike and moped measures.
At the end of 2002, almost two million francs remained of the framework of CHF 25 million.The remaining amount is needed for measures in connection with Veloparking at the train station and for measures in the Schwarzwaldstrasse and -Allee, the outer Baselstrasse, the Kleinhüningeranlage, Grenzacherstrasse and Hammerstrasse.A template for a new bike frame loan that has been announced for a long time is being developed.

Angaum for cyclists defused / / One of the most dangerous bicycles in the city, that between the main train station and the state museum, has become safer.The city wants to finish its bike network by 2008.
By Erik Eitlestadttrat Martin Waser (SP) held word.A year and a half ago, he presented four fully continuous bike routes at his first media conference as a city council.At the same time, the head of the civil engineering and disposal department at that time promised that he would deliver the still guilty solution for the passage that Daniel Leupi, President of the IG Velo and the Greens municipal council, once referred to as Zurich's “worst fear”: the route around aroundthe main station.
If you want to drive the bike from Bahnhofplatz or Central to Platzspitz or in the district 5, you need Courage - and a saddle -resistant guardian angel.Nadelöhr remains aside for a short time, this so -called museum node for bicycles is also reasonably passable.
The media representatives were able to convince themselves of this yesterday Tuesday.For this, the new generation of service from the Zurich city administration was ready for the trial trip - also a promise of Wasers.For the Bahnhofquai between the HB and the State Museum, the city, canton and IG Velo have found such a simple solution that the previous decades of searches are amazed.
Bruno Sommer of the traffic department of the police department spoke of an "optimized intersection".Dangerous, even though statistically not extremely accident, was so far the three -lane street to the red light in front of the whale bridge on the Bahnhofquai, where the above -ground car traffic mingled with that from the underpass from the left.Bicycles came into the clinch with automotiveists who changed lanes.44 Service for urban branches - after the bus stop and at the end of the underpass - now alternately hold back a traffic current.
With this, cyclists have enough time to get to the other side where the bicycle paths are marked yellow.In addition, bending on the left is prohibited in the middle lane.According to the city's representatives, nothing more was possible because the place in this needle is missing.
So there is no comfortable gondolas for cyclists.But if you sweat, at least not out of fear.The short test drive on the blue and white urban city bikes showed something else:
Velof promotion is obviously not an empty phrase in the city administration.After a long evaluation phase, in which numerous urban among the eight models were able to describe their favorites, the choice of Philip Douglas in Maschwanden fell in Maschwanden.The model with extra wide tires (because of the tram rails) is quite comfortable and, thanks to hub brakes, hub gear and a dynamo with a light sensor, is as good as maintenance -free.
The 44 bicycles at 1280 francs are distributed to the various office houses and, according to the motto "First come, first serve", are available for trips during working hours.So there are no specially reserved service bikes.You will be completed with the personal office key.
If the fleet is too small, the city wants to buy more city bikes.The Velo 2006 project was also presented on Tuesday, thanks to which Zurich should have a nationwide bike path network in a few years."Our goal is that Velo travelers can follow a safe route from each neighborhood," said Waser.
The programmatic name therefore stirs that the concern is part of the “Urban mobility” legislative focus.Velor routes were better laid in the Tempo 30 strategy, this time in cooperation with the canton, a so-called measure of measures was provided.Where close space does not allow separate bicycle paths, the safety of cyclists must be guaranteed in other ways in the future.
The existing infrastructure was to be “optimized and complemented as simple as possible,” said Waser.An unconventional example from the measure of measures are, for example, the light gray stripes in the Langstrasse, which today keep the bicycles free in traffic jams.A clear signage of all bike routes is also important.

Learning to live up / / / / The municipal civil engineering office wants to propagate the bike.There are guided tours for newcomers and anxious.
By Jürg Rohrerzürich.- “Velostadt Zurich” is the name of an action program that has developed six service departments of the city administration and the IG Velo.The purpose is to give bike in the city a new kick, to show the uses of the bike and make safe routes known.
Among other things, the program includes the following measures: The Velostadt Plan is reissued (expected in September), stand actions, mobile secured parking spaces at the Züri-Fäscht and at the theater spectacle as well as various adventure trips.Guided bike tours for the Puure-Zmorge in the Juchhof, the Langenberg zoo, to the brunch on the Katzensee, are planned for the noises of the night and the traces of history.
The adventure trips last until September;The detailed program will be announced in mid -May.According to City Councilor Martin Waser, the aim of these tours and actions is to bring those people to the bike who actually want to be afraid of traffic.
In Zurich, about 7 percent of all paths are currently covered by bike, 43 percent with the feet and 50 percent by public transport or by car.As Waser announced on Monday in front of the media, the bike campaign is part of the city's mobility strategy, which has been working for three years and which was confirmed by the voters in February with the yes to the traffic plan.In order to bring the message of the mobility strategy to the people, the civil engineering office organized the so -called mobility games in the main train station / Löwenplatz area last year, whose green traces and sayings are still visible today.
“Velostadt Zurich” is a kind of continuation of these games, next year the foot traffic is to be propagated.All of the principle of traffic strategy is to be space: coexistence instead of dominance, all types of traffic should have space, none should have a solo.Specific examples of this are the journey model for the leisure center Sihlcity, the lanes of car and bike in front of the state museum or the redesigned Franklinplatz in Oerlikon.
The urban traffic strategy is divided into 18 sub -strategies, of which there are now 12, 6 only recently.They were introduced yesterday: partial strategy (goal of low speed, especially in neighborhood centers), foot traffic (must be promoted especially in the development areas), disabled people, elderly and children (as little obstacles in public space), shopping and leisure traffic (feet andPromote), design of public traffic areas (simple and elegant), as well as economic and freight traffic (better information about the available special permits).

New constitution: Velo forgot / / In the draft for a new cantonal constitution of the canton of Basel-Stadt, cyclists are just as not mentioned as pedestrians.In its statement on the cantonal constitution, the IG Velo of both Basel pointed out this injunction.
It requires the admission of state promotion of locomotion on foot and with the bike in the new cantonal constitution.Basel without bike?It takes a lot of imagination to imagine Basel without bike.
You are an integral part of the cityscape;Likewise in the communities.And yet whoever travels the world is that there are not only cities that record more bicycles as Basel, but also those where, in the absence of the necessary infrastructure, no bicycles can be seen.
In the City of London, the bicycles were eradicated under the Thatcher government, so to speak.Now, like the beavers in the Basel area, room is created again and they slowly reappear.Such development fluctuations are the result of short -sighted planning.
They cost a lot of money and they would be avoidable if, majority -capable basic values and ideas of society were legally anchored in such a way that they are withdrawn from the displacement of the "daily policy" trimmed for quick success.The new constitution new Baselstadt constitutional draft comprises 150 paragraphs and ranges from the inviolability of human dignity to ensure the offer of education and the quality of life of the elderly until the protection of the community autonomy in order to take just a few topics.In just one paragraph, the draft constitution deals with the canton's transport policy.
The amazing thing: there are neither pedestrians nor cyers.Constitutional traffic policy
Following the draft constitution, the state ensures safe, economic, environmentally friendly and energy -saving mobility.This also ensures bicycle traffic, because the bike is particularly characterized by its economy compared to other means of transport, is environmentally friendly and energy -saving.According to the design, the state is also commissioned to promote sport and to protect and promote health.
The fact that health also plays an important role in transport policy was not taken into account.The IG Velo of both Basel therefore suggests that the text “health -friendly” complement: Transport politics §37
The state ensures safe, economic, environmentally friendly, energy -saving and (new!) Health -friendly mobility.If mobility makes us sick, we have to change it.The individual constitutional draft constitutional draft gives public transport.
It should be supplemented by private transport.Goods transport on the rail and the Rhine should be promoted and the state airport should be supported.No priority, no funding, not even support for bicycle travelers and foot traffic.
Fortunately, sighdering and bike strips are not uncommon for us today, but that can change again at any time.Or do we set other basic values in the long term?The most natural forms of locomotion, those who are not only economically, environmentally friendly and energy -saving, but also health -promoting, were not given a special mention in the constitutional draft.
Maybe the Constitutional Council took it for granted.That would be hope, but that's not enough - it's too short -sighted.Preserving the health of the residents is one of the most important tasks of the state.
One speaks of an ominous cost spiral in healthcare and does not recognize obvious relationships.A reasonable traffic policy can directly influence the way people move (continue).Driving in everyday life earns no less support than sporting activities in general.
And to recognize that the bicycle population represents a group of as representative as the athletes, a look at our streets is enough.The principle of funding IG Velo of both Basel therefore proposes to add the constitutional draft as follows: he (the state) promotes locomotion on foot and by bike.
In order for more people to move healthily, the prerequisites for a comfortable and safe transportation must be expanded on foot or by bike.The promotion of the really economic, environmentally friendly, energy -saving and healthy forms of locomotion is an important state task and requires a constitutional basis.Missing and foot traffic belong in the cantonal constitution.

Only for daring: Veloweg in Mexico City / / The Mexican metropolis never becomes a Velostadt.
Distances and dangers are too great.The newly built Veloroute cannot change that: the bike experience is a tedious obstacle trip:
Planning errors must be remedied six months after the opening.Mexico City.How does a salmon feel when he fought against a strong current and breaks down pebbles past him without a non -stop?
Probably like a cyclist who is traveling in Mexico City on the new Veloweg, which was created exactly between the motorway and the expressway.The cars race to the left and right, no closure separates the bike track from the motorized traffic lanes.By Martin Jordanwie the Salmon, which fails on a threshold that fails too high, the cyclist in the 20 million metropolis also comes across an almost insurmountable obstacle.
Suddenly the deafening journey is over: "Veloweg in repair", the sign announces in front of the construction site.The driveway to the bridge over a busy road is completely new.A serious planning error is fixed six months after opening the Veloweg:
The ramps were built far too steep, people had a lot of trouble up and roar down on the other side at a breakneck pace.The result was bad accidents.A policeman remembers a girl who fell on the descent, slipped onto the expressway and was carried away by a taxi:
«That was ugly.The little one probably broke all the bones. »Nevertheless, accidents are relatively rare, because the bike path is hardly used.Except on weekends when families take a trip to the Chapultepec Park with the bike.
"On working days, a cyclist comes over every two hours," says one of the police officers who sit in the shade under a bridge and read newspaper.Actually, they would have time to control the helmet obligation, but they don't see themselves.«How should we force people to wear a helmet if we don't get any helmets ourselves?“Asks the policeman back.
Because of the construction site, the transfer must be bypass, the expressway must be passed otherwise.That comes up with a real test of courage.Until you caught a moment to take a crossing, you can spread well and like five minutes.
On the other hand, the next obstacle is waiting.A bridge is currently being renovated there, with money from a private sponsor, as the responsible architect explains.A construction company donated the equivalent of around CHF 170,000 so that the steep ramps are also flatter.
The city government has estimated around CHF 13 million for the construction of the entire bike route, which is one of 80 kilometers.The second hurdle is overcome, follows the next.The bridge over the six -lane Avenida de la reforma will only be opened in a few days.
The waiting time for a crossing is at least ten minutes.Because no red light stops the flow of traffic, sprinter qualities are required.You can also in vain for special light signals for cyclists.
Stop signs do the highest of feelings when it comes to crossing streets.And then you are abruptly forced to repent.The Veloweg is over in the Nobelquartier Polanco, and a continuation is not planned.
What sounds adventurous and daring can still be attractive to tourists.The two round courses in the Chapultepec Park are particularly recommended, where there are no obstacles to be mastered and only have to be careful for walkers.However, two problems arise: Where do I rent a bike in Mexico City?
And how do I get to Veloweg safely through city traffic?Abrupt end of the two-wheeler excursion.The ramps on transfer bridges have to be rebuilt on the Veloweg in Mexico City because they were too steep.

Neither storm nor ice are on / / / / a total of 65 drivers work at Zurich's oldest bicycle service, the Veloblitz cooperative.To be a courier is not just a profession for her, but rather an appeal.
In the meantime there are even world and European championships for courier drivers.As a pedestrian you can often only feel their draft, the yellow bag sees flashing in the sun, and then they are bumped past you at a high pace: the bicycle, which are indispensable from today's cityscape.The largest and oldest bicycle service in the city of Zurich is the Veloblitz cooperative.
Founded by three students in 1989 and at that time native to a shared apartment, the Veloblitz has now blossomed into a reputable company.Nevertheless, everything is a little different in the bicycle scene.It is not for nothing that the drivers are “freaks” of the street.
Felix Schöpfer is convinced that Velokurier is not a normal profession, but a attitude to life.The lawyer switched to the bike one hundred percent and has been traveling for the Veloblitz in any weather for ten months.Neither storm nor
icy streets keep the couriers from fulfilling their orders.Although Creator only earns around half of his previous wages, the 31-year-old has never regretted the decision;The whole city of Zurich had become "his office".
At their extensive workplace, couriers occasionally also come into uncomfortable situations.So a driver recently refused to advance and then insulted him, says Schöpfer.The police, as a customer, four years ago, a Zurich courier was negative in the headlines:
After he had jostled a pensioner on the sidewalk on Bahnhofstrasse, he fell so unhappily that he later died of his head injuries.This was not an employee of the Veloblitz, says Roland Munz, chairman of the cooperative.Both Munz and Creator emphasize that it is not only dangerous, but also ineffective, to drive on the sidewalk.
However, some drivers would certainly occur that they occasionally disregarded a red light.Anyone who gets caught has to pay the buses from their own wallet.- But the drivers of the Veloblitz have to have a good reputation, because the Zurich city police are also found in their customer file.
Incidentally, the couriers in their five-hour shifts primarily supply media companies and banks.Anyone who enters the headquarters of the 50 drivers and 15 drivers in Zurich 4 initially thinks they are in a cozy student booth.A Töggelicast and a computer with an internet connection provide variety after the layer, and several colorful sofas nestle in a corner of the room.
The air is filled with the seductive fragrance of lunch, which cooked Heidi every day for the heroes of the street.Only those who penetrate deeper into the area of the bicycles realize that it is a control center: a bike hangs on the ceiling of the business room, large yellow pockets are stacked, and the dispatcher tries patiently, the couriers distributed all over the city by radioto reach .
Anyone who works as a telephony or a dispatcher at the Veloblitz knows what is happening on the street from their own experience, because nobody can avoid the courier trips.After the layer, the celebration is celebrated, even if the last driver has delivered his letters and packages, it goes up and down at the bike.Then it could be tomorrow for the last ones from the sofa, according to Munz.
Swiss bicycles are not only world leaders when celebrating, but also at international competitions.This year's European Championship of the Bicycles in Warsaw was more of a Swiss championship, explains Munz.The tasks at these championships are diverse.
Not only the delivery of temporary shipments, but also the long -standing sitting, without tipping off the saddle, and reversing in circles are disciplines in which the couriers compete and fight for medals.The last World Cup was held in Edmonton, Canada: of course - a Swiss.
However, the dream of every bicycle is to drive through New York's street gorges, says Munz.According to Munz, couriers are less likely to be overtaken by a motorcycle, this is sensitive to their pride.The SP cantonal council has a ambiguous relationship for car traffic in the city of Zurich:

No more bicycles on the motorway / / from bike and moped drivers to agricultural tractor;On the A 16 between Biel and La Heuchte everyone can run.
Now the federal government and canton are presenting a project to defuse the situation.Who voluntarily drives the bike on the highway?Velo and moped drivers who want to go to the Jura from Biel has no choice.
The only way to the Jurassic valleys leads over the A 16 - a former cantonal road that was classified in 1984 as a national road with mixed traffic.Again and again accidents that Denise Schiffmann, managing director of IG Velo Biel-Seeland, has long been questionable.«There were always accidents.
That is why we have been committed to the unbundling of traffic for ten years. »The greater is Schiffmann's joy now, since the federal and canton of the project, which is announced in JanuaryIn Schützengasse, the old Kantonsstrasse should lead along the forest into the Jura."This path is not only safer," says project manager André Liniger from the cantonal civil engineering office.
«He also has a gentler incline.»A new connection between Rondchâtel and Frinvillier is planned for agricultural vehicles, as the building, transport and energy directorate announced."For these connections, slow traffic has to accept detours," says Liniger.
For example, agricultural transport can only get to Biel via Magglingen or the Bözingenberg.The renovation of the A 16 and its expansion to the motorway are planned for a real motorway with traffic."We are planning to expand today's Rondchâtel quarter-connection to the Rondchâtel-Péry half-connection and the half-connection Biel-Nord / Magglingen as a roundabout for a full connection," explains Liniger.
A new cantonal road is to be built between Péry and Rondchâtel.The costs for traffic detention and for the road renovation amount to around CHF 55 million.The two -year construction work is to begin in 2006.

Velor route network is said to be ready by 2012 / / Peter Wittwervom 140 kilometers long Velorouuten network of Basel have been built in the past thirty years.In order to close the remaining gaps, the government council plans to invest another eight million francs in the promotion of bike transport. "Basel is one of the leading bicycle cities in Switzerland, but other cities such as Winterthur have been capable of caught up lately»:
For Barbara Auer, who heads the long-sam traffic department in the building department, it is therefore clear that there will be further investments in the promotion of bike intercourse in the next few years if the already high proportion of bicycle traffic in the city canton is to be further increased.With the CHF 25 million, which the Grand Council approved in 1988 to build a nationwide bike route, 123 of the 140 kilometers have been realized in recent years.However, essential gaps still gap from the inner city via St. Jakobsstrasse to the St. Jakob Park on the airport street or on the phases, which is heavily frequented.
The leadership of bicycle traffic over the new Margarethenbrücke is still open.As with other major projects, the financing of a secure bike connection here is not under the framework loan decided in 1988 to promote bicycle traffic.12 percent.Not least because of the CHF 11 million, which unexpectedly had to be invested in the construction of the bicycle at the SBB station, the loan approved 16 years ago has largely been used up.
The government council therefore decided yesterday to apply for a second framework loan at the Grand Council.With this money, not only the remaining 12 percent of the bike route network is to be finished by 2012, but also further measures to promote bicycle traffic should also be financed.According to
In addition to structural measures such as the defusing of dangerous crossings or improving bike storage systems, Barbara Auer also deals with targeted clarifications of the needs of the Basel Velo drivers.A location determination HA-BE showed that at the level of quality in frastructure measures that have now been achieved, the government council writes in a media release alone, in order to further increase the proportion of bicycle traffic.
Specifically, in the next few years, suggestions for improvement of the affected people should be collected and checked in a scientific monitoring how traffic reacts to individual investments in bicycle traffic.Poor data.The aim of these measures is to improve the still poor data situation in the planning and management of bicycle traffic in Basel.
In order to be able to exploit the great potential in Basel alone in terms of topography, the framework loan should also be available for measures in the areas of public relations, training and image funding in the coming years.If the Grand Council approves the loan template, the government no longer has to have all these individual measures approved in separate advice from parliament.

Fathers of Veloland Switzerland / / Solothurnonnohne Velobüro
Olten would not have a sophisticated route network.What started in the canton of Solothurn in 1991 is today a prime example of sustainability in tourism and everyday life.They are the fathers of Veloland Switzerland: Markus Capirone and Thomas Ledergerber.
With your team from the bike office Olten, you have created something that Switzerland is doing well - and the tourism industry lets it clap in your hands (see box "Economic Factor").Because now country is known to land: with bike tourists is good at cash.
The struggling travelers leave the Swiss streets around CHF 200 million annually.Therefore, it is worth taking a look back at the history of the bike hiking trails.It was on an autumn day in 1989: "From a damp -resistant velobrainstorming on the subject of cycle hiking trails" is written in the annals.
It was the birth of the Solothurn cycle hiking trails as a CH91 project."We had a vision," says Capirone. "We were also lucky enough to have good advocates," added Ledergerber.The then government councilor Alfred Wyser and his secretary Marianne Frei, a tourism specialist, were impressed by the idea of the planners.
And so in the Olten-Gösgen-Gäu region, the 700th anniversary of Switzerland, the country's first official bike hiking trail was opened.Two years later, the Solothurn region was also included in the route network.This time, too, the bicycle office had a prominent fore spokeswoman: old government councilor Cornelia Füeg.
"Politicians helped us to make a breakthrough," says Markus Capirone.Large corridors of the canton that had a signposted bike hiking trail now had enough, but the initiators are far from enough.
«We already had new plans in our heads.We wanted to create a nationally networked bicycle pike offer, »says Ledergerber.Something that the two Velo-Weltenbummler would have wanted in their tours through the neighboring countries.
The project was launched in 1994 together with the Swiss Tourism Association.The bike office was again in charge.The Veloland Switzerland Foundation was founded in November 1995 for the implementation of the ambitious plans, in which all cantons and many public and private associations and companies are represented.
The project was implemented within three years.Quality at the first Stellas Velobüro now left the tip to others.From then on it was a contractor of Veloland Switzerland.
"Quality improvement and quality care are our most important tasks today," says Capirone.This also includes the revision of the route guides.To date, 1,80,000 of the nine route guides of Veloland Switzerland have been sold.
Control drives on the route network are part of this quality care.The “bicyclists” - the team includes six men and one woman - regularly on the cycle hiking trails.That too may be a reason for the success story.
The fathers who call themselves a service provider still hold their threads in their hands in the background.They negotiate with communities, cantons and landowners when choosing a route.You are the recognized contacts.
This is also confirmed by Peter Geissbühler from the Office for Transport and Civil Engineering.He is the bike officer of the canton of Solothurn.«Without the bike office
Olten there would be no Veloland Switzerland, »he says.Thomas KnappzVG control trips are part of the job: The team of Veloland Switzerland regularly leaves the bike pandering.
Markus Capirone, Thomas Ledergerber, Martin Utiger and Peter Anrig (from left to right).According to a survey by the Veloland Switzerland Foundation from 2002, the kilometers driven annually generated a turnover of around CHF 200 million from Earth to the sun).The approximately 150,000 multi -day travelers spend around CHF 130 a day.
They leave 2 francs per kilometer and 40 centimes on the Swiss streets.The annual estimated 3.3 million day trippers "plaster" 60 centers per kilometer driven.The bike tourists book over 600,000 logging nights every year.
A third of all tourers come from abroad.Erich Egli, Tourism Director Solothurn, speaks of a "very strong and indispensable factor in medium-sized tourism".In numbers that means:
Velotourists leave around 5 million francs in the canton of Solothurn every year - from spring to autumn.When the survey in 2002, 1000 bike tourists were counted in a single day in a single day.TKO500
Kilometers through the Canton Veloland Switzerland launches new regional routes.In the canton, the route network is extended by 150 kilometers.
The route network of Veloland Switzerland is 3300 kilometers.The nine national routes lead through around 1,000 municipalities.Now Veloland Switzerland plans to expand the routes until 2008.
In cooperation with the cantons, a regional route network of a total of 4000 kilometers is to be built.The national routes remain marked with the numbers 1 to 9.In the future, the regional routes will be signposted with double -digit, local routes with three -digit numbers.
New signaling for the “regionalization” of the cycle hiking trails was transferred to the Velobüro Olten.In cooperation with the cantonal traffic planers, the specialists have determined the routes - or will still determine them.This summer, the canton of Solothurn will also open regional routes, and local cycling trails will be added next year.
This means that the route network is expanded from 350 to 500 kilometers today.However, in the canton of Solothurn, however, it is not partly new.Part of the signaling is replaced and / or supplemented with new signs and information boards.
The regional routes continue to lead through the already known cycling trails.The canton is responsible for maintaining the bike paths.According to Peter Geissbühler, project manager and Velo -officer in the Office for Transport and Civil Engineering, the entire route network is checked in spring and before the autumn holidays.
The new regional routes in the canton of Solothurn: number 34: Alter Bernerweg, Route de l ’Ancien Régime Bernois.From Estavayer to Baden.

Still not satisfied / / mbm.Anyone who is traveling with the bike in the city center of Zurich is not always easy.
It is not everywhere, not all automobileists take into account the two -wheelers.Satisfying solutions for all road users are not possible for structural and financial reasons.Representatives of the Velo interest group described the situation as very unsatisfactory at a press conference on Thursday.
President Daniel Leupi criticized the responsible city councilor Esther Maurer, who did too little to improve the situation.Since it had been in office, bike traffic has increased significantly, but the problems associated with it had never been addressed to the cause.Instead, the number of harassed buses against cyclists, especially on the Langstrasse, has increased.
For this reason, the IG Velo is launching the petition “City of Velo drivers - now”.According to Leupi, the quick implementation of a safe and continuous bike route in the city center is required.In addition, misconduct by automotiveists should be lost to bike drivers.
Finally, it is required to renovate conflicts between bike drivers and footmakers.Leupi is also bothered by the inconsistent signaling and the frequent mixing guide of traffic, which inevitably leads to any way in terms of compliance with the rules.However, he was aware that there are also black sheep among the two -wheelers.
The IG is committed to ensuring that bicycle traffic is generally led on the road and not on the sidewalk.Dave Durner, Managing Director of IG Velo, actually wants to ride on the street.Automobilists who overtake too closely, hold on the bike strip, turn without flashing, and open the door without looking back, forced the cyclists to switch to the sidewalk.

Switzerland, the Veloland / / Andy Kesslerkolumnstroße Week, I once again felt that we live here in Switzerland in Veloparadies.Of course, I also fled to the south over Pentecost, because the weather was slowly becoming depressed here.
I experienced a wonderful week in France;Of course with the bike to explore the area.On the way there I was able to ride in the car, but I had to take the way back with a train and bike.
In Montélimar I wanted to solve a ticket for myself and my bike at the train station.The whole story turned out to be quite difficult: Unfortunately, the dear computer of the SNCF did not find Grenchen in his route network.
I then tried Biel, since Grenchen does not seem to be one of the most popular Swiss cities ... - but also there: None.I was only able to solve a ticket to Geneva and I was told that I should look in Geneva - so much about globalization.We eat potatoes that come from Austria, are washed in Italy and be processed in France, but are processed in France to buy a train ticket to Switzerland, this is not possible!
When loading the bicycle, I only received a compassionate smile from the nice counter: something like that was not possible in France.When I thought that I should be in Grenchen the following day, I slowly but surely started sweating a little.
Fortunately, I had my bike sack with me.In Switzerland, it enables me to transport free of charge.Unfortunately, it didn't go long until the next disillusionment.
Unfortunately there was no place on the train to deposit the sack.As the only option, I had to position myself with a bike sack in the entrance area of a wagon.But this was also the case of four and a half hours, getting out at each station, let the passengers get in and out, and then, after the last one had entered, squeeze on the train again.
After Geneva then the redemption: bike compartments, where you could hang the bike comfortably.In Biel the surprise: the train was stormed by bike drivers.It was clear to me that this could only be in Murten because of the slow -up.
Slow up, the Woodstock of the cyclists.An event with the 45,000 cyclists and inline skaters moved silently on car-free streets.In addition to normal bicycles, you can find the wildest creations on two or more wheels.
All the ordeals in France were forgotten in one fell swoop and I was proud to live in a country with over 3,300 kilometers marked bike paths, with trains in which you can load bicycles and with train stations where you can rent bicycles.By the way, one of the most beautiful routes is in front of our door.The Solothurn-Biel bicycle route is one of the highest-safe routes in the whole of Switzerland.
My suggestion for a wonderful day with the family: start in Solothurn with a rented bike at the train station.On the Veloweg to Biel, with a Znüni in Altreu.Give the bike back in Biel and with the ship to the St. Peter's Island.
After a culinary break on the Heideweg on foot to Erlach and from there by public transport back to Solothurn.A wonderful triathlon of locomotion, which unfortunately - or luckily, is only possible in bike -friendly Switzerland.Andy Kessler (40) is the managing director of BMC Trading AG in Grenchen, who equips the professional cycling team Phonak with racing bikes.

Another heat impact idea is obviously in the distribution of various speed categories (10, 30 and 50 km / h) on a hiking path, Veloweg and street - with a corresponding signaling forest and control effort.The recipe of the quirky Munich comedian Karl Valentin could also be checked against the traffic chaos: on Monday only pedestrians, only cyclists on Tuesday, only drivers on Wednesday...Or in January only pedestrians, in February only cyclists, in March etc.

Winterthur receives the Prix Velo / / Winterthur.- 175 kilometers of cycling routes, privileges in the signaling, many bikes in the street - Winterthur is a bicycle -friendly city.
IG Velo Switzerland also recognized this.Winterthur has granted a recognition award of the Prix Velo for exemplary bike infrastructure.The competition was announced for the first time.
Nineteen cantons, cities and municipalities have applied, four were awarded a specialist jury yesterday in Biel.The main award winner is the city of Biel.In addition to Winterthur, Thun and the canton of Zug have received recognition prices in the form of a clock with the inscription "Comes time, Coming".
Winterthur as the "pioneer city" Luzia Meister, Vice President of IG Velo, described Winterthur in her eulogy as a pioneer city in bike funding.For two decades, the “fastest, cheapest and healthiest urban means of transport” in Winterthur have been consistently promoted.The result: a admired proportion of a good 20 percent Velo vocational spendlers in the city and a decreasing number of incorrect cyclists.
The PRIX Velo aims to spread good ideas and knowledge.Construction manager Reinhard Stahel (FDP) pointed out the long bike tradition in the former industrial city.In fact, the first special bike paths were called fifty years ago in Winterthur.
In the future, it is about further improving parking at the train station and overcoming the bike barrier railway tracks in the city center, said Reinhard Stahel.Parking garage for Velosdie City of Biel has also received the main prize of CHF 10,000 for their intelligent combination of car and veloparkhaus as well as for decentralized, covered bicycle parking spaces.The canton of Zug not only set a coherent cycle path network, but also a specialist office
Slow traffic also ensures that the plans actually become bike routes.The city of Thun has a holistic traffic policy and has achieved positive improvements for slow traffic in recent years, says the jury.The Prix Velo is to be awarded every year in the lines, in the straight years to bike -friendly companies, and in the odd years at public institutions.

In Switzerland, 100,000 bicycle parking spaces / / Bern, Oct. 25 (SDA) in Switzerland are missing, according to experts in public spaces, over 100,000 safe bicycle parking spaces are missing.
At a conference of the interest group (IG) Velo Switzerland, actors from bicycle traffic discussed possible remedies on Tuesday.Especially at train stations and other central locations, there is a lack of quality bike parking spaces, said Christoph Merkli, Managing Director of IG Velo.These are often incorrectly placed, insecure or overcrowded.
This would promote damage, vandalism or even theft.Merkli also demands that the public sector support new facilities financially.For Rudolf Dieterle, director of the Federal Office of Roads, bicycles play an important role in solving today's traffic problems in the agglomerations.
The example of the city of Biel was presented at the conference, which received the Prix Velo for the first time in 2005.In Biel, it was possible to create attractive and safe bike parking spaces all over the city, said Martin Urwyler from the Swiss Velokonference.With their “Bike and Rail” program for the years 2006 to 2015, SBB want to cover the future needs of bicycle parking spaces at train stations.

In it, the IG defends itself against a break in Route 3 from Schwamendingen to the university district.This route is "brutally cut off" because a gravel path next to Winterthurerstrasse on which the Veloroute runs was banned.In addition, the Veloroute 2 from Wollishofen to Seebach is also at risk from a driving ban at Paradeplatz. «The blocking of an important traffic axis is probably only conceivable in the bike sector.
It is inconceivable that someone would even come up with the idea of putting on driving bans on the rose garden, »writes IG Velo.In the city, the problem with the interrupted Veloroute 3 has now been recognized, as Jürg Hellrigl, deputy director of the traffic department, explains.The signaling with the driving ban was "an accident" that will be corrected in the next few days.
The fears of route 2, on the other hand, are unfounded.Hellrigl assures this.(mth)

Basler Velonetz spins away / / Markus Kochervelobe should become even faster and even more attractive in Basel.The Great Council's Traffic Commission proposes a higher passage in the implementation of the measures provided for in the second frame loan.
Basel is still eight million francs away from the perfect Velostadt.The network for the leg -powered two -wheelers is already quite dense - which Basel makes one of the most interesting cities in Switzerland for cyclists.However, 12 percent are still missing in the Basel bike route, the Great Council of which had spoken a total of CHF 25 million in 1988.
Today, 17 years later, the first bike frame loan has been used up.With around CHF 12 million, the construction of Veloparking at SBB station devoured the lion's share of the loan - an investment that was not planned at all.In October 2004, the government council therefore stimulated a second bike frame loan in the amount of eight million francs to complete the work.
The business went to the environmental, transport and energy commission (Uvek), which a sub-commission, presided by DSP-Grandrat Stephan Maurer.And it now switches a gear."We are convinced that the upcoming measures can be implemented within five years," summarizes Stephan Maurer the most important decision of the sub -commission.
The government had originally planned for the implementation for eight years.The eight million loan, Maurer believes, is sufficient.However, only thanks to a "paradigm shift" (bricklayer) in the building department: the VeloCredit is only burdened if a project stands for itself - and cannot be financed as part of a major project from a different pot. New parking?
Nothing has changed on the routes themselves.Important supports from the Velostadt Basel are still aware of their implementation (see above).( 1 )
A separate bike bridge, which, together with a pedestrian overpass, leads parallel to the SNCF bridge over the Zolli.(2) The continuation of the Veloweg along the Euroville houses at SBB station (Peter-Merian and Jakob-Burckhardt-Haus) to the Münchensteiner Bridge.
(3) The expansion of the underground Veloparking at Centralbahnplatz."This is the most concerned with cyclists," says Kathrin Schweizer, Managing Director of IG Velo of both Basel:
The free area is overcrowded and there are too few annual tickets for the payment area.(4) A sensible solution for the wildly parked bike at the Baden train station.
This project, says Barbara Auer, head of the slow traffic department in the building department, still bears many question marks.Maybe there is even an underground parking?"In this regard, we are in negotiation with the landing owner, the Deutsche Bahn," says Auer.
But also in the inner city, the Uvek reports, more parking spaces are urgently needed.In residential quarters and at public transport stops, in addition to the number, the quality of the stands should also be increased (theft and covered). An increasing opening of one-way streets is also planned.Today of 651 one-way sections 436 are open to bike contrast.
In some cases, an opening was rejected - a reignalization for 141 more one -way streets is still being examined, said Stephan Maurer.The Uvek says that this program should be completed in the next two years.In a good three weeks, the Grand Council will decide whether it prefers the accelerated procedure of the Uvek compared to the eight-year proposal.
"Then we would have to see how we can get through with our projects in the shorter time," says Barbara Auer.By the end of 2010, the remaining 17 street kilometers would have to be paved for bicycles. Motivation campaigns.Public relations are also contested for the first time with part of the bike frame loan.
For half a million francs, campaigns and promotions such as “Slow Up 2007” (which you want to bring into the region), “Basel rolls”, a car -free day or motivational campaigns are initiated, reports Barbara Auer.For the IG Velo of both Basel, the faster gait would be a good thing."Little has gone here for a year because of the expired loan," says Kathrin Schweizer.
However, there are also some losses - such as the lifting of the bike strip on the Gundeldingerrain or the unsatisfactory situation in the access to the Claramatte car park.An American bicycle planner who recently examined the situation in Basel enthused whether the advantages for pedalers on the Rhine knee said.He almost declared Basel to be the greatest Velostadt in Switzerland - if he hadn't traveled to Winterthur shortly afterwards.> Www.veloklimatest.ch more and safer.

The bike as a hand luggage - it depends on the cover / / Gerhard Lob, Bellinzonanur Velos, which are packed in the SBB -owned bag, are transported free of charge.This requirement continues to apply.
Nicola Colombo from Bellinzona is a locksmith by profession.This may explain a certain persistence when it comes to his great passion: the locomotion on two wheels.As an ecologically set person, he swears primarily on the combination of bike and train.
For years he has been fighting for the SBB Velos to transport free of charge.Colombo believes that this type of promoting public transport for tourism and the environment is necessary in a canton like Ticino.
The biking biker therefore prefers to force the Swiss railway on the legal process for the concessions of the grid transport.But his request received a sensitive damper last Friday.A criminal judge in Bellinzona whispered him to pay CHF 100, 250 francs to SBB and to assume the court costs because he was caught twice with the bike without the corresponding ticket on the train and his buses (deliberately) are not payable.
The argument that the bike is a normal hand luggage and takes less space than some overseas cases had not already accepted the SBB.According to the federal law on public transport, “the traveler” may take easily portable objects (hand luggage) into the vehicle free of charge if the conditions allow it.“But this provision does not apply to a bike, even if it is easy, the sole judge judged.
"The bulkyness of the object is decisive whether something can be defined as hand luggage," said the judge, even if he recognized the good intentions of the accused.Completely covered.
Velos can be carried as hand luggage for the SBB on the train if they are packed in the “Transbag” bike bag.But the front wheel of the bike must be removed and the handlebar has been turned.To prevent this, Colombo took his own cover, a so -called "Transburka".
This completely hides the bike, making it easier to transport - but a ticket makes it necessary.Now the 35 -year -old has lost the battle in front of the Kadi - but the political struggle for the free of charge from Velos into the train is not over.As the founder of the “Ruotalibera” internet platform, he wants to continue to struggle for efficient intermodalverkehr Velo / Bahn.

In 1975 the traffic planners discovered that they had forgotten the bike / / Today there are more bicycles in the city of Zurich than cars and almost 340 kilometers bike routes.Zurich .
- «30 years of bike promotion in the city of Zurich 1975 to 2005» is a brochure that City Councilor Martin Waser (SP) and its traffic planners from the civil engineering office presented on Tuesday.This success story is rather the chronicle of a late love with a happy end.Because although the bike was the means of transportation of the little man in the first half of the 20th century, the bike completely disappeared from the heads of the Zurich traffic planners after the Second World War.
Their attention was paid to the canalization of the rapidly swelling car flow and public transport.The impetus for reversal came from politics: in 1973 the young LDU councilor Alfred Rudorf found a majority for his postulate of a bike route through the outdoor quarters 11 and 12.
In 1975 the first signaled bike route was opened from the Katzensee to Oerlikon and Stettbach.Supported by the growing ecological awareness, IG Velo celebrated a triumph with its popular initiative in 1984: 76 percent of the voters said about a continuous bike path network of 200 kilometers.Praise from the healthy laziness bis at the end of 2006 Zurich will have 340 kilometers of bicycles, of which 150 kilometers are provided with signs.
It is estimated that there are 160,000 bicycles in the city, more than 140,000 cars.The bike uses about ten percent of the mobile population every day.Like City Councilor Martin Waser: «I am too lazy for sport.
With cycling, I have it as a waste product with me.»(DS) The 46-page brochure can be ordered free of charge at the civil engineering office, mobility and planning, Werdmühleplatz 3, 8023 Zurich, or on the Internet: www.stadt-zuerich.ch / Mobil-In-Zuerichbild Reto Oeschgerdas Zürcher Velowegnetz lies cyclistsand politicians.

The bike as a full -fledged urban means of transport / / AVA.Through the streets of Zurich, more bicycles roll than cars.Estimates assume 160,000 bicycles and 140,000 cars.
The bike uses around ten percent of the mobile population every day.Until the 1970s, however, the bike had no place in Stadtzürch's traffic policy.It has only become a full -fledged urban transport in the past 30 years.
The civil engineering office of the city of Zurich worked on the history of bike promotion from 1975 to 2005 and presented the publication “30 years of bike promotion in the city of Zurich 1975 to 2005” at a media conference on Tuesday.The 48-page free brochure shows the history of Zurich's transport policy from the first political advance to the present day.It is designed and presented with contemporary sources and pictures portraits of people who have been committed to cycling.
City Councilor Martin Waser told the media that the constant increase in overall traffic should only be mastered if the space -saving bicycle transport continues to take over traffic shares.This is "not an ideology, but simple necessity".Waser emphasized that the population's mobility needs would continue to increase, but the existing space would remain the same.
At the end of 2006, around 340 kilometers of bike routes will be available in the city of Zurich."Nevertheless, many children no longer master cycling too well," complained Daniel Leupi, President of IG Velo.He called for campaigns that fight this fact.
At the moment, many children would still be bike, but the trend is decreasing.Leupi thanked everyone who has helped in recent decades to make Zurich more and more a bike city.To do this, you had to "kick something from time to time, and not just in the pedals," he said with a smile.
He compared the last 30 years of bike promotion with the upbringing of a toddler.One was proud of the smallest achievements and have caught and maintained the project.But it always goes on, and you shouldn't rest on the achieved.

At the Limmatquai, tolerance is required / / To the construction site at the Limmatquaidie construction site at the Limmatquai demands consideration from all road participants.Velo travelers in particular have to be patient, since there is a bicycle ban from the helmet house to the Rudolf-Brun bridge-understandable if the bike path is impassable.
In the morning before 8 a.m., few passers -by are on the road, and the quiet Limmatquai literally invites you to oppose the ban and drive the sidewalk with the bike.However, the enjoyment of the peaceful pedal finds an abrupt end: The city police are already awake and eagerly takes it for unauthorized driving on the footpath - mind you: for 100 meters.
For large construction sites in which all road users are restricted in their mobility and have to take into account, I also expect tolerance from the police, especially since the bike is doing active environmental protection, especially in this weather (topic ozone).My criticism only refers to the area mentioned;I do not mean that traffic rules for bike are not valid.

For such a project, average daily traffic with over 3000 movements would have to be achieved.In addition, "more than two accidents with bike participation would have to be done annually," writes IG Veloweg Eriswil-Huttwil in a message.The IG is disappointed with the cantonal decision, but does not think about giving up.

For bicycles, the climate / / in the first Swiss Veloclimatest, Burgdorf did very well in comparison.Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do.
In Burgdorf it is easy to drive.This is the result of a survey by the Velo Switzerland interest group and the Velojournal.As part of the first Veloclime test, 3000 bicycles were interviewed all over Switzerland last year.
The questionnaire consisted of topics such as traffic climate, security, comfort, importance, infrastructure and own behavior.In addition to Winterthur, only Burgdorf received a sufficient result with a grade of 4.1.The results of the Burgdorf population were officially handed over not surprised.
"It doesn't surprise me that Burgdorf has reached second place," said Christoph Merkli, Managing Director of IG Velo Switzerland.However, he would have expected that the grading level would be higher overall.Burgdorf has received a sufficient grade for the traffic atmosphere, for its importance and the infrastructure.
The grades for security and comfort are almost insufficient.Most cyclists considered their own behavior as enough to well.Schleche notes were available for security in terms of bike thief.
48 questionnaires have been received in Burgdorf, which, according to Merkli, is a top value in view of the population.The Veloclimatest is not a representative survey - it is more of a mood barometer.The need for improvement "The grade 4.1 shows that there is still a need for improvement," said municipal council Markus Grimm.
The idea of the cyclists is part of every street construction project of the city.Martin Wälti from IG Velo Burgdorf emphasized the importance of marketing.It does not bring anything if you have a good infrastructure and the bike paths would not be used.
"Burgdorf has proven that public relations can promote cycling," said Wälti.With a combination of communication and infrastructure, one can contribute to a good bike climate without much financial effort.He was convinced that the mood between bike and drivers is less aggressive today than 25 years ago.
Nevertheless, it was criticized in the test that conflicts with cars and other cyclists could sometimes be problematic.Wälti also sees need for improvement - for example at the cycle path ring around Burgdorf.Although this is "a great thing", it is rather difficult to get to the city center with the bike.
You will be determined at the next Veloklimatest 2008 what the future state of Burgdorf looks like.Theophil Bucher is increasing to his bike.

Dirty bicycle paths / / 400 million for Zurich bike paths, TA from July 21st, it is gratifying that the canton of Zurich wants to expand the existing bicycle path concept, it serves traffic safety for cyclists - provided that everyone also uses the bike paths.But before you start expanding, there are other priorities in this regard.
So you should better entertain the existing network and clean the cycle paths from time to time.Two days ago I caught a flat foot on a bike path - the third time this year.This time it was a smashed beer bottle.
But not only broken glass contaminate the bike paths.Often it is stones from mornings, dirt from farmers who order their fields, or cow flatbread.Fortunately, the rain occasionally cleans the bike path of dirt.
I recommend that the competent head of office or government councilor Rita Fuhrer once check the routes of Seelmatten-Turbenthal, Elgg Winterthur, Ellikon on the Thur-Rickenbach or Aesch-Henggart.I could list more bike paths that are constantly dirty.Ernst Fischer, Winterthur

Routen-Highlight also leads through Langnau / / Langnau in the Swiss Mobil project.The municipal council gave the green light for the inclusion of two routes, the Langnau municipal area.
The Switzerland Mobil project wants to ensure that Switzerland wandering, cycling, mountain biking, skating and paddling worldwide.In 2008, 20 national routes and 100 one or several days of route highlights are to be realized for these sports.In order to achieve this goal, the federal government, the cantons and institutions from tourism, transport and sport are developing special offers.
The municipality of Langnau am Albis is also to take part in the project, with the following routes: Regional Route 47, section Hike (Albis Panoramaweg-Zurich / Zug) and Regional Route 94, Rubrik Velo (L'oeuse-Emme-Sihl, Fleurier-Zurich). The Langnau municipal council approved the admission of these routes into the project, especially since the municipality does not add any additional signaling costs.The hiking country routes usually lead over already marked hiking trails, the Veloland routes are also already signaled at national and regional level.

Advantages of the bike / / for the third time a mobility week is carried out in Freiburg.The bike is at the center of the campaign.
The third mobility week in Freiburg runs under the motto "With the bike into the city".«The bike is often associated with a sporting activity.
It is forgotten that the bicycle is primarily a means of transportation, »explains Silvia Maspoli Genetelli from VCS Freiburg, who organized the mobility weekhas .Distances up to four kilometers were easiest to cover the bike. "But time savings are not the only advantage of a bike," says Silvia Maspoli.«Bike driving guarantees good health.»
Furthermore, the bike does not cause air pollution.It was time to invest in bicycle -friendly measures in western Switzerland cities.The program of the mobility week is versatile.

The Global Player couldn't do better / / five years ago, the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee and Oberland announced the cooperation with the global company Veolia.The cooperation observed by the competition has brought little more than sobering knowledge to the little partner.
The call of the stirrup holder for the invaders from France is still liable to the small transport company from Grüningen today.Five years after the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee and Oberland (VZO) have announced their cooperation with the global group Connex (now Veolia, one of the world's largest operators of rail and bus lines), they are still observed in the industry.Offers to cooperate have already been answered with a rugged “with you certainly not”, says VZO director Werner Trachsel.
In anticipation of the soon-to-be liberalization of public transport, the VZO (209 employees, 56 bus lines) in 2001 sought cooperation with the French global company (72,000 employees, 236 rail and bus nets in 15 countries).The small Zurich Oberländer Transport company, an AG owned by 14 municipalities, hoped for the cooperation in particular.Veolia without magic middle
On the other hand, Veolia took the opportunity for partialization to get to know the Swiss market environment.If the market opened up as part of the bilateral contracts, according to the consideration at the time, the group would have gained enough experience with the regional bus lines to concentrate on lucrative city traffic.For this reason, the Veolia concluded a contract with the bus operators from Grüningen in which the global corporation committed not to deny a tender in German Switzerland without VZO.
The company thus had a lot of costs its helvetic market entry.But in the five years that have passed since the much -noticed shoulder end, less than expected in the stained Swiss market.The liberalization of public transport is still long in coming, and bus lines have only been tendered in recent years.
Where tenders were carried out - for example in the Aargau Wiggertal, in the Engadine or in Interlaken - there were usually legal disputes.The St. Gallen government councilor Josef Keller recently also had to experience how rough the wind can blow on the face.After the government council rewritten 17 bus lines in the Sarganserland and finally struck it to a company with a Austrian minority stake, the head of the economy department was threatened with death.
Because Rheintal Bus AG offered the service, which had previously been performed by Postbus Switzerland, much cheaper, the passengers fear for the Public service and the Buschauffeurs for their wages.The Veolia was one of the competitors in the St. Gallen tender in conjunction with the VZO.However, the French Swiss tandem was not successful this time either.
Because despite the world's worldwide experience of the French group, the unequal partners have not yet been able to win a single tender.The global corporation, which expects a minimum return of 3 percent, is simply not yet competitive in Switzerland, VZO director Werner Trachsel sums up.In the five years of the collaboration, it was shown that the globally active French would have no magic means.
Another reason for the unsatisfactory competitive result is VZO and Veolia's wage policy.Instead of saving in personnel costs - the much largest cost factor in public transport - they proposed to increase the additional income.Among other things, they planned a parcel service and a paid mobile phone service with information about any delays.
The offer, which the partners submitted, was finally 250,000 francs below that of the competition winner.However, the VZO and Veolia were still more than 1 million francs cheaper than the Swiss Postbus.In their own market area, the bids of the competitors lie so closely together also shows how hard in Switzerland must be calculated so that a tender can be obtained.
The victorious Rhine Valley Bus AG offered a prize that is CHF 1.5 million under today's compensation for Postbus Switzerland AG.Despite the sobering balance sheet, the Zurich Oberländer want to capture transport companies in cooperation with the French large group.If Veolia had won the tender in Sarganserland, only service orders would have been removed for the VZO.
"When cooperating, the VZO was primarily concerned with gaining experience," says Werner Trachsel.An expansion was never the goal."Growing", sums up the VZO director, "we have to in our own market area.

"Veolia wants to grow in Bern" / / French Veolia does the waste disposal business from Bern and applied for the operation of bus lines.Switzerland boss Jean-Marc Janailhac: "We see ourselves as a supplement to the public sector." Monsieur Janailhac, Veolia as a French group has applied for the operation of public transport in Worb.
Why ?Jean-Marc Janailhac: Veolia operates underground railways in Boston, Sydney as well as Stockholm and, for example, rail and bus lines in France and Germany.
I would like to show that the company has achieved know-how in the operation of complex transport systems for more than 15 years.We offered in the canton of Bern to draw attention to our services.Our model does not provide for the privatization of public transport.
Rather, Veolia sees itself as a supplement.If you combine the public services services with the know-how of a private company, this results in powerful offers.Are you disappointed that the mail has been awarded the contract?
The disappointment is that Veolia could not show what was in the company.However, we continue to endeavor to offer real added value.Didn't it work because Veolia is a foreign company?
I do not believe that .The holding company may be in Paris.But Veolia also works in Switzerland with the four fields of water treatment, waste disposal, transport and energy service.
These are Swiss subsidiaries that employ more than 1000 Swiss workers locally.Will you take an appeal?In contrast to local competitors, I see no reason for this.
The mandate has been correctly awarded.Will Veolia apply in other Swiss cities to operate public transport?If the opportunity arises and the cities want it too, we will definitely try.
Where ?In Geneva, Veolia already operates some bus lines from the municipal transport company with Dupraz Bus.In the transport area we started in western Switzerland in this country.
But if you look at the population, it should hardly be surprising that we are now increasingly focusing on German -speaking Switzerland.The waste disposal division has the Swiss seat in the capital Bern.The proximity to politics is important in this business.
The proximity to the citizen is even more important.That is why our contacts take place at the community level.National politics comes into play when it comes to new environmental laws.
We chose Bern as a location because it is central, lies in a populated canton and we are already significantly represented with the battery cycling company Batrec in Wimmis and the special waste user Sovag in Münsingen in the canton of Bern.Do you want to expand in Bern?That is intended, yes.
There are two levels.On the one hand, we want to strengthen the cooperation with the public sector.We are interested in disposing of the waste in Bern cities.
On the other hand, growth also means more coordination.This means that more management activities are needed.What does that mean in places?
Veolia's growth over all four business areas between five to ten percent a year is overall Switzerland.Theoretically, we speak of 50 to 100 new jobs per year in Switzerland.Of course, the growth of sales and personnel is not congruent.
Veolia recently acquired the companies Amstutz in Obfelden, Sibag in Emmenbrücke and Schmucki in Dällikon and provides to bring them together with SOVAG in Münsingen.Does the concentration continue?Waste disposal requires investments, coordination and high -tech.
The challenge is to better reconcile all of these areas in order to work even more environmentally friendly and efficient.The concentration process is therefore not yet complete - not only in Switzerland.How lucrative is waste disposal?
It is an industrial activity.Investments are needed, staff and a strong financial structure is necessary.Our margins are neither higher nor deeper than in other industrial groups.
However, we focus on research and training.It is about sustainable development and the protection of our employees' health.Does that even fit together, economy and ecology?
It must .Only a growing economy gives people the necessary financial means to fix environmental damage.However, in the long run, humanity can not only react constantly.
It is high time that we act.That is why our business is clearly towards the prevention of environmental damage.How difficult is it to sell services like yours?
We don't speak of sensual products such as perfume or luxury watches here.Indeed, that is not easy.We actually sell a promise based on 150 years of experience.
Veolia provides a service for certain conditions and demands money for this.At European level, we underline sustainable development and environmental aspects in communication.For example, Veolia Environment 2006 had an advertising appearance in all important European airports.
In Switzerland, Veolia's first appearance will be the first important appearance in Bern on February 15th.CEO Henri ProGlio, together with the President of Nestlé and Credit Suisse, takes part in a podium on the topic of "Sustainable development from the perspective of globally operating companies".Interview: Jon Mettlerveolia154-year-old history French Veolia group was created from the Générale of the Eaux, which was founded in 1853.
In 1998 Vivendi participated in Veolia, but rose again two years later as the main shareholder.Since then, the company specializing in environmental services has been listed on the Paris stock exchange.Veolia employs 2,70,000 people worldwide and generated sales of 25.2 billion euros in 2005.
In Switzerland, Veolia works in the areas of waste disposal, water treatment, transport, energy and industrial services.The waste disposal division is summarized in waste disposal Holding Switzerland AG, based in Bern.1000 employees work for Veolia in Switzerland.

Problems and a new name / / from IG Velo Burgdorf becomes Pro Velo Emmental: For the 25th birthday, the bicycle lobbyists gave themselves a new name.
On its 25th birthday, IG Velo Burgdorf changed its name.It is called a new Pro Velo Emmental
And thus complies with the wish of IG Velo Switzerland, which wishes a certain uniformity among the regional associations.At the same time, after a change in the statutes, she can expand her area of activity to the whole Emmental. "We are the region's traffic policy conscience," said President Theophil Bucher in front of his members.And further with a look that regional politicians, as she asked the BZ for the anniversary for a short appreciation, sometimes make critical tones sound (see texts below):
This not only brings the club sympathy, but that is nevertheless or precisely that is why you are on the growth course.After 50 new entrances, the number of members is now 450. The hole in the cash force to celebrate to celebrate is not the bike bbyist despite the anniversary.The 27,000 francs are deficit that cashier Urs Schneeberger had to present to the meeting.
The hole in the 50000 franc household was created because of the redesign of the homepage, which devoured CHF 9,000 alone.In addition, there were additional expenses in the management because incumbent Jens Montandon had closing exams and had to be replaced by a deputy.Finally, the two bicycles did not bring the hoped -for profit in spring and autumn.
As an immediate measure, the autumn exchange takes place in Langnau, where the costs are significantly lower than in Burgdorf.At the same time, an increase in the commission of 15 percent is considered.The assembly also approved higher membership fees.
Individual members pay 40 instead of CHF 25, families 50 instead of CHF 30.Problem train station conversion option was also considered that individual members could do without the delivery of the expensive velojournal.
In addition to the bicycles, the driving courses with a bicycle control in Burgdorf and Langnau are also continued.There are also actions for traffic safety and the repair courses for young people.The station conversion in Burgdorf is worried because it is unclear where the bike station will then be accommodated.

Soon also in the upper Emmental?/ / The heart route is popular: over 10,000 people drove the route between Hasle and Willisau with the bike last year.
Now Kurt Schär from Biketec AG also wants to signal a route in the Upper Emmental. "The heart route is the most successful bike route in Switzerland," says Kurt Schär.He is the managing director of Biketec AG in Kirchberg.This in turn produces the electrovelos, with which less well -trained loosely come uphill.
The 55 kilometers of the heart route between Hasle and Willisau were actually created in the year of commemoration.According to Matthias Moser from Pro Emmental, over 10,000 people left the route last year.Fritz Jakob von der Emmentaler
Show cheese dairy illustrates this.«In summer there was hardly a day when there was no flyer in front of our house.“Jakob is happy when the cyclists in Affoltern not only change the batteries on the flyer, but also recharge their own in the restaurant.
Also in the “Bären” Madiswil, the cyclists liven up the lunch business on beautiful days.The cardiac route was launched in the 1983 peasant war.
Paul Hasler from the Utopien office in Burgdorf had the idea."A loose project group," said Matthias Moser, implemented the project by quickly painting arrows on the asphalt.Thanks to the flyer, "the project would have died again without us," says Kurt Schär.
Only his flyers, who were available for rents, had helped the heart route to break through.Because without the supportive battery drive, the cyclists would be overwhelmed with the route, says Schär.Inspired by the success of the heart route, Schärs Biketec has realized similar flyer rental projects in 25 regions of Switzerland and nearby countries.
Now she also wants to signal a route in the upper Emmental.The route is currently being defined.With restaurants and those interested in tourism, Biketec is to clarify where flyers rented and where battery change stations could be set up.
This year a pilot test will start, next year the second heart route will be opened in the Emmental, Schär announces.Now an united in the club is no longer sufficient.After the heart route had been re -signaled in the last spring, "we tried to regulate responsibilities in a performance contract," looks back Matthias Moser.
This was difficult with two cantons, three planning regions, transport companies, tourism organizations and numerous individual providers.Brand law also requested its own legal structure, says Moser.Pro Emmental has had the lead over the Mobility Network since 2004, "now we dismiss the child into self -employment".
The “Interest Group Herzroute” association will therefore be founded in Affoltern next Friday.Kurt Schär is planned as President.Susanne Graf

Berner should switch to the bike / / Bern has ambitious goals: In three years, the population should choose bike as a means of transport than before.
A separate veloampel, an additional bicycle signal or a one -way street that is accessible in the opposite direction for Velos: Many such small measures and some larger projects should make bike in the city of Bern easier and thus also more popular.Because the city has set itself high goals: “In the next three years, 50 percent more ways should be covered with the bike.
Foot traffic is also to be increased by 20 percent, »said municipal councilor Regula Rytz yesterday in a media orientation.In particular, the authorities have the many car journeys in the city of Bern, which are less than 5 kilometers long.In the future, the population should no longer only take the bike for 12 out of 100 of these short distances, but rather for their 18th bike bridge over the Aareder period, hold dangerous crossings, cumbersome detours or a lack of parking facilities from switching to the bike, Regula Rytz is convinced.
Therefore, the city got an old draft for a bicycle traffic plan from the sinking and now creates a new version of it.In this execution plan, the city lists a complete network for bicycle traffic in the city.The districts connect 108 kilometers of main routes.
Another 138 secondary routes serve as additional connections within the quarters."For us, the structure plan is the Velowegweiser into the future," said Regula Rytz.This means that not all routes listed are already bicycle -friendly.
One of the routes does not yet exist: the bike connection between Länggasse and Lorraine listed in the structure plan is currently still wishful thinking.The canton and the federal government should also participate in the planned bridge over the Aare.The city has four million francs a year to promote foot and bicycle traffic.
In the near future, larger improvements are: bike station in the Milchgässli at the train station; new foot and Veloweg in Upper Bottish; better signaling of the bike routes in all parts of the city; bike strips on Laubeggstrasse; widening of the foot and Veloweg along the Dählhölzliwald between Gunplatz and Kalcheggweg. "We cannot improve everything, »Distributor Regula Rytz dampens too high expectations.Sometimes there is a lack of money, sometimes in the square, which would prevent better solutions.
The experts do not know exactly what the millions that the city put in the foot and bike traffic do not know: "We are missing the statistical basics," admits Hugo Staub, head of traffic planning.But he can also say: more foot and bike intercourse means better air, more health, more traffic safety and more space in the city.

The existing sidewalk directly on the Seestrasse is hardly used by pedestrians.From security considerations, it would be logical that pedestrians could move as far away from the street as possible.The correct order of the traffic axes would be footpath, Veloweg and Strasse.
With the expansion of the Shada Hall, an additional security risk for the guests is created, as the Veloweg leads directly past the main entrance!The guests often stay before the occasion and during the breaks in front of the entrance.It is not excluded that this can lead to dangerous situations and one day.

“Wear - or pray” / / the city police Grenchen, Olten and Solothurn actively participate in a Swiss bike campaign.When it comes to mountain biking and racing bike, the Velohelm is part of the basic equipment.
However, he is less well received in the city and on short bike routes.But especially in city traffic, there are great accident risks for cyclists.Here the city police want to offer support and have a preventive effect, it says in a message.
The campaign is under the motto "Wear Velohelm - or pray".In schools, on the street, in conversation, with posters and flyers, they draw attention to the dangers.Until the end of April, the advice center for accident prevention (BFU) offers all bicycles a reimbursement of CHF 20 when buying a bike.
In cooperation with the TCS, the city police carry out a family day to traffic safety.It has already taken place in Grenchen at the end of March and came up with great appeal.In Olten he will be carried out on May 5 around the tower, in Solothurn on May 26th on Klosterplatz from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
"Learning by doing" is the principle of the campaign.The city police set up a bike course on which children can test their skill.Velos are available, but they can also be brought with you.
One reason why the city police take part in the campaign is the still high accident rate in Switzerland: Last year alone, around 1,500 people suffered severe traumatic brain injuries in a bike accident.35 people even died fatal.Mgt /

On the other hand, Pro Velo wants to prevent the closed entrance from Spiez to the A 6 towards Thun.Zeller is convinced that this will also benefit the drivers who would otherwise be hindered by slow traffic.Only one partial success achieved per bike with the objections to the development of the planned Bären SPIIEWILER service center.
Pro Velo wished that the access routes should be adapted to a large scale.After all, the attachment of bike strips is checked along Simmentalstrasse.When it comes to new bike strips from the Kanderbrücke to the Zeughaus, the IG wants to be presented with the community.
These stripes have already been left.The traffic is growing continuously by Landi Spiez on the Faulenbachweg with the search for a partner (in this newspaper there was talk of Lidl) again generates multi -traffic.The IG Velo is concerned about this increasing traffic without measures for the weaker road users;
Including children on the way to school.Rudolf Zeller said: “The Spiez resident population has increased by 30 percent since the 1980s, with a Swiss average of only 16 percent.During this time, the cantonal roads in Spiez were only adapted to the new needs with the exception of some crossing aids.»
Therefore, in addition to the cantonal roads between Faulensee and some on Simmentalstrasse, the IG wants to clarify the needs of the bicycle travelers.Uniform image of the Swiss IG Velo is renamed Pro Velo Switzerland with subgroups.In order for the same name to be used consistently and a uniform appearance and occurrence, the IG Velo Region Spiez is called from January 1, 2008

In addition to the leaflets, the civil engineering office has published a brochure with information about cycling in the city of Zurich.Among other things, the urban mobility strategy stipulates that the proportion of the paths covered with the bike increases to 12 percent.In the last survey seven years ago it was only 7.3 percent.

In 2000, only 7.3 percent of all paths in the city were covered with the bike - in 2010 it should be 12 percent when it comes to the city of Zurich.The city already declared a bike year in 2004, and since then a lot has happened, as City Councilor Martin Waser (SP) explained yesterday at a media conference.Especially in recent times there have been improvements for the bike, especially in the city center.
For example, the Niederdorf has been opened for bicycle traffic, the Rudolf Brun Bridge has a bike strip for every lane, and the almost car-free Limmatquai offers practically free travel.It is also planned to release the Langstrasse in both directions for Velos.However, this still has to be approved by the local council.
"But we are optimistic that this will work," said Waser. 2007 the city now wants to set accents again to bring more Zurichers to the bike.Similarly to the successful city walks, the civil engineering office issues plans with three bicycle walks.The first is already available (see graphic):
The tour leads through Aussersihl, Wiedikon and Züri-West.In July there is a second by Oerlikon and Affoltern, a third through Albisfieden in September.A brochure with the most important tips about cycling in the city and a bike agenda with important dates is also brand new.
According to Urs Walter, the city's Velobe representative, the aim of the campaign is to convey "that you can drive well in Zurich and that it is fun".Recently, urban bike policy has even been awarded by Bypad, a European organization that is committed to more quality for cycling.It came to the conclusion that the political and institutional framework in Zurich are good, but that there is still a lack of public relations and consciousness formation.
The city now wants to start.In the new bike brochure there are not only route information and concrete driving tips ("Drive confidently, and take the place that you are entitled to.or can have it repaired.
And what you should do to prevent theft (“3.8 million bicycles are in traffic in Switzerland. More than 100,000 pieces are stolen every year.”). “Züri rolls” gives free bicycles particularly easier to drive to bikeabout the social project "Züri rolls".
This year, too, 40 to 50 bicycles are available for borrowing at five locations (State Museum, Pestalozzi Wiese, Opera House, Engine, Swissôtel Oerlikon) - around CHF 20 depot and the deposit of an ID.The campaign runs daily between 7:30 a.m. and 9.30 p.m. by the end of October.2470 bicycles have been borrowed since 1994-on average 190 bicycles were on average, each was on the road once a day. "Züri rolls" is an unemployed project by the Asylum organization Zurich (AOZ).
In particular, asylum seekers who are not allowed to work in Switzerland will find such an employment.According to Aoz director Thomas Kunz, “Züri rolls” each season 130 people from around 30 countries.Velo brochure, plans and agenda are available at the civil engineering office, Werdmühleplatz 3, Tel.

Stable trailer from Burgdorf / / The Burgdorf Velostation has developed a stable bike trailer especially for her home delivery service, which it also sells.The old supporters of the house delivery service of the “Velostation Burgdorf Services” (VBD) have had their day.
Since yesterday afternoon, the drivers have been curling with brand new bicycles by the VBD itself through Burgdorf's streets.The stable trailers were specially developed for the home delivery service, said Martin Wälti, member of the VBD management, in media orientation.So far, the trailers had been bought from the bar.
Before commissioning, work had to be made, such as the installation of a more stable tub.The load capacity of the new bike trailer is around 60 kilos;He cost CHF 2000.
With Zurich in the business with the new development, Wälti, the VBD, also explained the entry into the production business.The social company was already able to sell ten supporters to the Zurich home delivery service in Sihl City.Wälti expects other companies to follow: "By the end of 2008 we will have sold the 100 bike trailers for delivery purposes," is his forecast.
Martin Wälti was able to present two more innovations at the media orientation.As a new service of the VBD, the “Competence Center Velo -Bänger” (KZVA) started operating at the beginning of May.With this service, the social company closes a gap, Wälti is convinced of this.
The demand for children's and transport supporters increases steadily.Many dealers offer a few selected trailers, but test drives are rarely possible.Not so in the bike station: Customers can select from ten different models and test them over a few kilometers.
Martin Wälti estimates the use of the new home delivery service supporters as the most important innovation of the VBD.These offer relief for the drivers and help shape the cityscape.With the promotion of the “short distances”, more people and thus also larger sales in the city, Wälti explains.

The bike as a feeder / / Bern, May 18.(sda)
The Association IG Velo and the European Cyclists Association want to link the bike more to public transport.The residents of Switzerland travel an average of half the world every year.With the bike, only 264 kilometers or 1.4 percent are covered, as Christoph Merkli, Managing Director of IG Velo, said before the media on Friday.
The bike had lost terrain to the car, but also compared to public transport, although various cities had made great efforts to promote cycling.According to the SBB, there are 90,000 bike parking spaces in the vicinity of train stations.10,000 more will follow by 2010.
According to the IG Velo, the Velo, as a feeder, has a large development potential for the next bus or train stop.The IG Velo suggests the federal government to act on different levels.Part of the investment fund for the infrastructure in agglomerations should benefit bike funding.

Velo- and Irrwege / / The moving pharmacies are traveling in Italy at the Giro these days - and they have a good thing: on all sides blocked streets, wide -open medication cabinets, al dente cooked pasta.How much more tedious is the pedals in this country, for example in and around Zurich.
Although the city government (never stuck with her own praise) of a continuous velonetz and invites you to public walks and does not refer to the canton of cups of kilometers to bike.You don't need to be an Ironman or a mini-cancellara, a few spontaneous rides on Grossmutter's bike to determine quickly: with such a wide-meshed and holey network as the city causes to bait the environmentally friendly and storage-resistant pedalers, a fisherman would notBring the catch ashore;And the bicycle strips called large -lane paths, as the canton provides them, usually lead to the goal, but before it is always misleading.
Let's put the test on the example, between Horgen and Bellevue in the city.Despite the almost constantly horrific volume of traffic, the Seestrasse is still popular with bike drivers, thanks to the many seaside resorts even with families who, along with the highway- also affect the velovignettes.We are quickly located on the bike strip, a lane, the limitation of which is the curbs on the right, a yellow dashed line on the left.
This narrow -gauge requires the ability to keep his vehicle straightforward on course - a matter of course on a main street.But at the latest after the second view of the asphalt, you are already looking for the yellow stripes in vain, the bike track has disappeared without a trace.The reason is a traffic island for pedestrians, in addition to which sheet metal bin and bike have to be forced together.
A few meters after the island, the yellow stripes reappear out of nowhere.Nevertheless, there is no calm, not because the next traffic island would follow after a pedal revolution (there are at least two), but because of suddenly parking spaces take part of the road - and more than a little bit because the car models popular in this country (camouflaged tanks) do not fit into the intended rectangle.Despite bike track, the two -wheeler is left behind and mixes tapping heart back to the four -wheelers.
The game repeats itself again and again to the city limit.In the city then the deserved breather from thrill and exhaust gases.The bike is actually leading away from the street, directly to the lake shore.
But the supposed Veloparadies proves to be a free game in the urban jungle.Although plates and street markings also indicate a two -class society (left, the travelers, on the right), go, roles, blades, jogging, stroll, rush all crisscross.The proportion of those who confuse mobility with a mobile phone on Velo also increases - about the same suddenly as that of these "Hoi, I bi degrees from velo" contemporaries outgoing danger potential.
If you still manage to the Quai bridge accident-free, the next exam is already facing: The double one becomes a simple bike (which is hardly visible to the washed-off color because of the washed-out color), from which the cosiness in a Zurich ship still turns into a cozy ship-Char becomes a horde of rushing who are ready to go over (bicycle) corpses for catching the next tram.The meandering to the leaning bike riders wonders why the linen compulsion only applies to four -legged friends.
Zug proves that there is another way.There are not stripes there, but red -marked areas that do not simply disappear even in pedestrian islands.The clever goes to the train.

Popular Initiatives for Velo Förderung / / Pro Velo Zurich, the former “IG Velo”, launches two popular initiatives, as announced on Thursday.An initiative for more bike transport should ensure that the proportion of the bike in the distances covered in the agglomerations increases.
Zurich is in line with other areas.Second, an initiative “for more traffic training” is to ensure that the traffic instructor is no longer the task of the community, but again the cantonal police.According to Pro Velo, both proposals have the stuff to counter problems such as climate change, fine dust, lack of exercise and overweight in children.

Is free vignette painted?/ / If it is based on the Spiezer municipal council, there should be no free bike children for Spiezer schoolchildren next year.
The Council wants to provide less money for traffic measures in the future. "The cycling of velovignettes is not funded to school children," the municipal council explains its application to the municipal parliament in writing.The free tax is a voluntary performance of the community.
And: «The Velovignette today costs between four and six francs per bike.For the individual citizen, these costs appear relatively low compared to the purchase of a bicycle. 8,000 francs per year, however, the free delivery of velovignettes to school children costs around CHF 8,000 per year.»
The large municipal council will decide on the future fate of the free velovignette in its meeting on June 18. ”An act of reason” will only be the planned abolition of the free bike omnitude is only one of various austerity measures that the municipal council conducts on behalf of the GGR,Says municipal councilor Christian Zaugg, head of the security department.Christian Zaugg is aware that this measure is not popular: "If you take away something to people that is perceived as a matter of course, resistance cannot be ruled out." Nevertheless, what the municipal council is doing is "an act of reason": "He lives the savings order of the GGR and checks the expenses for all administrative departments.
Only if everyone helps can we succeed in getting the community finances even better. »The referendum subordinates the free velovignette on June 2, 1991 as part of a referendum-with 1718 yes to 1017 no-this should be approvedDecision of the large municipal council to be subordinate to the optional referendum.Which means that a referendum is necessary if at least five percent of the municipal citizens - around 500 signing - require this.Also on the line of ongoing saving measures is the application of the local council to shorten the contribution to traffic -assured measures.
From 2008, for example, CHF 50,000 should be issued annually instead of the CHF 60,000.Less money needs less money for improving traffic safety, Zaugg explains: “Various measures have been implemented in recent years.»Especially in the area of school routes, the most dangerous places could have been defused.

Velokanton Zurich / / Mbm.The quality of bike routes primarily depends on whether you can find them.
For this reason, the local and regional bike routes in the canton of Zurich have been linked and uniformly signposted with red boards.A Velonetz of 600 kilometers and 15 routes is now available throughout the canton.City Councilor Martin Waser, head of the civil engineering and disposal department and passionate cyclist, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the canton was bike to connect to the city.
Velof promotion is a focus on the city council, since the two -wheeler is the ideal means of transport, especially in Zurich.A continuous and well -signaled bike route is important.From now on, bike tours will no longer end at the city limits, but continue to the region and even to the whole of Switzerland.
The regional network is in turn integrated into the national of Veloland Switzerland.According to Waser, the Velonetz has been continuously expanded in Zurich and made more secure with structural measures.So far, the city had around 150 kilometers of signaled routes.
Now 45 kilometers of regional routes that lead through the city have been included in the signaling.For Waser, this integration is another stage in the city's bike funding.District President Rita Fuhrer, director of the economy directorate and regular cyclist herself, really started raving when she spoke about the possibilities of exploring the landscape with the bike.
Long -term driving gains more and more in importance and popular, which is why good signaling and a tight route network are important.The signage in the canton has been in three stages since 2005 and has now been completed.There are large information boards at large train stations, path marks and important intersections, so -called info points, with information about sights and for location marketing.
It is particularly important for Fuhrer that the signage is not only agreed with the cities of Zurich and Winterthur, but also with the neighboring cantons.In 2008, around 50 bicycle routes are said to be uniformly signposted across the country.The canton wants to continue to provide for the promotion of bicycle traffic around CHF 10 million a year.
George Ganz, President of Veloland Switzerland and Switzerland Mobil, praised the quality of the Velonetz in the Canton of Zurich.Pro Velo Kanton Zurich was also satisfied with the opening of the route network.The signaling of a cantonal network is a milestone for bike transport, it says in a message.

Traffic training standardized / / Zurich.- The Pro Velo association launched popular initiatives for traffic training and bike funding, which it presented to the media yesterday.
Three years ago, the canton wanted to stop traffic training for reasons of savings.In an emergency exercise, the parliament has given the municipalities to the municipalities in an emergency exercise, said Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo Kanton Zurich.This resulted in individual municipalities saving traffic training, while others even expanded their offer.
The first initiative now calls for a uniform solution.The costs must be covered by the canton.For Daniel Leupi, Green City Council and President of Pro Velo, the bike still has a wall flowering in transport policy.
Therefore, the second initiative requires a cantonal law to promote the use of the bike.The aim is to triple the proportion of bicycle traffic in the agglomeration from almost 5 to 15 percent.How this should be done in concrete terms is left to the legislator.
The initiatives were started on June 8th.So far, around 1,700 signatures have been collected.(high)

Is it really about traffic safety?/ / «Bahnhofstrasse is not a bicycle path», TA from the 3rd 8th who drives Velo in the city of Zurich in the city of Zurich either goes in acute danger to life or goes three quarters of the route on foot.But of course FDP and SVP politicians have little idea of that.
On the Weststrasse, for example, a PW in a rapid journey overtook me with a maximum of 30 centimeters.As so often, the maneuver was pointless, because this was followed by a red traffic light.There I made the driver calmly and politely aware that sufficient distance should be maintained when overtaking (Art.
34 and 35 SVG).«I have my car under control.“Language and roar.
Such incidents are 100 times more dangerous than cycling over the Werdmühleplatz, where, I bet, no one has been injured by a bike for 50 years.It is better to get my bird if you practice slalom between footmakers or drive into the intersection at red.Is it now about traffic safety or about missing a memo as many bike drivers as possible and effortlessly as possible?

We organized it with business people at the time.Apparently it just takes time and several attempts.But this time it should work.
The introduction is planned for next year.We hope we can do it this time.How will the home delivery service work?
We are still at the beginning with the planning.Basically, we would like to transport with bicycles, whatever possible.Vehicles operated with alternative energy are to be used for larger deliveries.

The orphanage square on the last Saturday: Twike on Twike on hybrid car are in large numbers side by side.Twikemobiles meet or drive away;It is a silent coming and going in the middle of a busy Saturday afternoon.
Numerous people go back and forth between the companions, stop, discuss, look, touch, touch, read.The opposite of the tuning fair on the Bea area.This year's "Bern moves" campaign day, on the International Mobility Day, is all about alternatively driven vehicles.
It is not a car -free day, but a day that wants to set the course for the mobility of the future with today's, alternative and environmentally friendly technology.Car -free days are anything but popular.Most of the time, a small faction of cheating environmental improvers of a large majority of annoyed normal consumers faces.
Most people don't want to do without comfort and mobility.This year's day of action of “Bern moves” started at this point.Environmental protection should not hurt, but fun.
The Twike Club called for the international meeting.On that day, over 100 Twikemiles from Switzerland, Germany and Belgium shape the cityscape of Bern.The Twike shuttle service brings passers-by free of charge from the Viktoriaplatz, Bärengraben and Helvetiaplatz to the city center and back.
The interest in these familiar and still foreign companions is great - greater than at every trade fair, says a stand owner who informs you on the orphanage.Service on customer life to the vehicles of the present and the future, a new home delivery service will also be promoted on this day, which will start working in the next spring.With the aim of facilitating the customer to use public transport for shopping in the city.

Rolling revolution / / nothing can stop the Paris traffic revolution.The “Vélibs” (“Vélos en Liberté”) are everywhere, almost every 300 meters can be found with these loan bikes in self -service.
By the end of the year, more than 20,000 of them will be deployed within the 20 arrondissements.The campaign, which started in mid-July, is a resounding success of the public: more than five million lending processes have been set off.
Representatives from New York, Chicago, Sydney and other metropolises already came to admire this system.The Paris street image is definitely beginning to change.The cyclists, who have so far hardly been tolerated in the boulevards dominated by motor vehicles, conquer their place.
And this often with the naive intolerance and cheek of newcomers.Since your vehicles are environmentally friendly, they step into the pedals in a parent and with a pure conscience.As long as they were a rare and daring jungle for their bare survival in the Paris street jungle, the police were looking out of the custody if they abandoned certain traffic rules.
In Paris it was almost a habitual right that they ignored red lights, one -way streets or pedestrian zones.In 2005, 71 percent stood in a survey that they did not take note of the red lights, and 60 percent that they often switch to the sidewalks.But now the exception from the rule becomes a mass phenomenon.
And the first victims of this lack of discipline could be the freshly converted Vélib consumers.They put themselves and others in danger through their often unconsciously risky behavior.So far, this has assumed that this has been flimmed in light:
Fortunately, the thirty additional accidents that go to “Vélibs” in the first three months were said to have only slightly injured.So that the VeloRevolution does not end with a massacre, the law enforcement officers are now entering with a bus block.The tariff is the same as for the automotiveists: 90 euros for disregarding a red light, a one -way street or driving on the sidewalk, 22 euros when calling in traffic.
According to police statistics, the number of buses for two -wheelers has tripled.The urban authorities therefore already asked the police not to punish the road rowdies too hard in order not to endanger the success of “Vélibs” with deterrent sanctions.Rudolf Balmer, Paris

With a new impetus on the Leihvelo / / Georg Schmidtsie act independently of one another, but have the same goal: To make the bike more attractive for short-haul, two bike entrepreneurs from the region want to raise a rental system.
The Therwiler Fredy Zaugg is not an ambition without ambition.He likes to step into the pedals to bring his bike ideas forward.He is part of the project for a regional bike hall for train drivers (the BAZ reported).
And now he wants to convert the “mobility” idea to the bike."I would make the necessary 150 bicycles available for a pilot test with maybe twelve stations," says the 59-year-old.The “docking stations”, on the other hand, should be financed by the public sector and by advertising.
Paris model.The system could work similarly to the red mobility cars.You buy yourself into a cooperative and then access the bikes as a member.
A fine -meshed network of stations and attractive usage tariffs are important: "With‹ Velib› in Paris, the first hour costs only one euro, "says Zaugg.In general: Paris ›This is the great example of Zaugg.By the end of 2007, the rental system there is to be expanded to 20,000 bicycles ›at 1500 rental stations.
“Velib” is a success story, but Mulhouse also knows a comparable bike loan.In Basel, however, a first attempt for a bicycle loan in the 1990s failed, but there are also new efforts to bring loan velos to people (see second text).The local transport systems are attached to their limits, which now makes a clock compression in the Leimental necessary in the Leimental.
Rental bikes could bring some relief here.And if you think about new parking garages in the agglomeration, you could also announce a bike rental there.And: "Velo use decreases," says Zaugg, the youth, for example, drive less bike than before.
He wants to change that.Chance.Where the project is the chance of the project is clear to Zaugg: «Many ways are so short that they can also be easily covered with the bike.»
Perhaps you have to add e-bikes to the offer to put the inhibition threshold as deep as possible.He says in all openness that Zaugg also wants to use the idea to diversify his business.To talk about exact locations, be it too early, "you would have to move in traffic planners".
Zaugg spontaneously calls the hay scale in Basel or 'for a shopping tour through the Mühlematt shopping area ›The Hüslimatt station in Oberwil.With representatives of Basel-Stadt, Zaugg had already loose contacts, in December he was invited to a conversation to Liestal.With the lobbyists of gentle mobility, the idea is already a good response.
"You have to put the inhibition threshold as deep as possible and keep the formalities low in rental," emphasizes the local VCS managing director Stephanie Fuchs.Like Kathrin Schweizer from IG Velo, she emphasizes that the idea in Zurich has long since proven its suitability.In the country, the two women say, there is a certain potential in the management of the “last mile” between the train station and the outdoor district, which means:
Instead of going on foot for a quarter of an hour, a bike is grabbed at the public transport.Whether the pilot project can be realized has to show.Zaugg, however, remains the optimist: "At the end of a contract in autumn 2008, the bicycles would be ready to go in spring 2009." & GT;

In a suit in the Grand Council, Jörg Vitelli (SP politician and owner of a business for Velobedarf) asks whether a public bicycle loan system could not be set up in Basel ›Analogous to the existing offers in Mulhouse or Paris."An attractive Velostadt and further bicycle promotion not only include expanded bike paths and parking spaces, but also an attractive bicycle loan," says the advance.
In the “much praised” Velostadt Basel, such a public bicycle loan system can make an important contribution to the increased use of bike in local transport.With the cancellation of the white parking spaces in the city, rental bikes would also be a “concrete alternative” for motorized commuters in order to get to the workplace quickly.This could also make a contribution to reducing the air pollution.

There are no continuous bike compounds in many places.One -way streets or a lack of branching options would make the direct journey more difficult, you complain in the reasoning of your postulate.Many bicycles would move on forbidden paths in Wädenswil, or they would have to accept cumbersome detours via parking spaces and side streets.

"We are happy to do that," says Walter Bischoff, head of the Wisli workshop in Bülach.You can have your bike cleaned, wait or repaired at the Velo workshop of the association for social psychiatry Zürcher Unterland.At the start of the season, the protected workshop offers a small service for 50 francs in a so-called bicycle spring campaign.
The bike is cleaned, lubricated and subjected to a traffic safety check.For 40 francs more, the bike is also re -discontinued and defective parts are replaced.What is special: In this workshop, people work hard on the general labor market.
Be it because they are not up to the pressure, stress or constant change of employees.Be it because her psyche forces her to slowness or breaks.People like Felix Imboden from Bülach.
The trained car mechanic finds his work in the bike workshop interesting and varied.He and his five colleagues are always looked after by a group leader who has a pedagogical training in addition to the craft profession.Together they picked up old bicycles over the winter time, screwed them apart and put them together into sparkle-nail-nailed second-hand bike.
"Three becomes two," smiles Walter Bischoff.40 of such bicycles were created.They offer between 100 and CHF 150 on the bike tour in Bülach at the end of March.
The Wisli workshop itself does not have to make a profit."However, we are self -supporting," says the managing director Christof Bidoggia.In addition to the bike workshop, Wisli offers other services that are cost -effective on the one hand and on the other hand helps employees to work within their options.
Quality from the prison from a different framework than usual, the men have to work in the Pöschwies prison in Regensdorf."There is an obligation to work with us," says Hansruedi Spillmann, Head of Economy and Work.This means that the 420 men who are in the prison, bake, carpentry, lichen chairs, print and assemble, whether they want or not.
"We are obliged from the law to employ the prisoners," says Spillmann.Actually a win-win situation: While a large part of the prisoners learned a craft from Pike for the first time in his life, the prison management reduces its cost deficit with the profit.The full order books of the print shop show that the prisoners do not have to keep their performance behind the mountain.
The Pestalozzi youth center Burghof in Dielsdorf is similar.There, for example, young people who have committed criminal offenses are trained as a car painter, mechanic or body pluger.With the result that Burghof runs a car workshop that does not have to shy away from a comparison with the private sector.
Reins, gardening, helping out space in the free economy, the employees of the 8304 Valaisellen or the Bülach zipper have not yet found or have not yet found.Many have been unemployed for so long that they find it difficult to structure their day.
Both non -profit organizations of the communities of Valaisellen and Bülach help them to find a daily rhythm again by offering them work for which the customer often has no time.This can be garden care, evacuations, window cleaning and repairs of all kinds.But this can also sew, courier services or the help in the office.
While the customer only has to book the employee of the 8304 work group or the zipper as long as he needs it effectively, it remains the world of work or finds it back into it.Correction/Poeschwies/index.html www.burghof.org www.werkgruppe.wallisellen.ch www.buelach.ch/reiss closure picture David Baerfelix

Apparently, neither Ms. Fuchs nor Ms. Schweizer seems to have noticed that a problem -free crossing of the city is already possible for the cyclists today, but at times a bike by bicycle by parts of the city center is also required and can be accepted.Of each .Unfortunately, the practice looks a little different.
And the bar must finally be rigorously pushed!For the sake of the pedestrian.However, if we banish motorized traffic from our city, nobody needs to drive through it anymore.
Then there are no more businesses for which it is worth going to the city.Why just, have to try different forces again and again to break our city?Pierre A. Sobol, Basel

Government Council is rejected by Velo Initiative / / Pro Velo wants to promote bike traffic in the canton of Zurich - with a new law.The proportion of total traffic should increase to 15 percent.
The initiative is through the government.Zurich .- The group Pro Velo Kanton Zurich wants to promote Velo with the popular initiative “for more bike”.
A new law is intended to create the framework conditions in order to increase the proportion of bicycle traffic in the agglomerations of the canton of Zurich to at least 15 percent.Today this value fluctuates between 4 percent in the city of Zurich and 10 percent in Winterthur.The government council considers this claim to be "hardly" realizable.
He therefore rejects the referendum.The bike is not equivalent in comparison to public transport and motorized private transport, since it is very weather -dependent and not available to every road user.The required increase to 15 percent would not be mainly at the expense of private transport, as the initiators hoped.
Rather, foot traffic and public transport would have to have springs.The government council also emphasizes that the road law contains sufficient regulations for the construction and maintenance of bicycle infrastructure;CHF 13 million from the street fund would be available from the street fund.
Pro Velo clears errors in the government councilor's attitude is disappointed: it is known that the government council "does not emit no leg for bicycle traffic," says Managing Director Dave Durner: "Nevertheless we hoped a little more.»
Specifically, Pro Velo hoped for a counter -proposal from the government council.The ball is now at the cantonal council, says Durner.In the event of a constructive counter -proposal, per bike is ready to withdraw the initiative.
The fact that the canton spends a lot of money on bike transport does not deny per bike."However, this is not a strategy," says Durner and refers to the cycle path concept from 2005, which is nothing more than a "list of priorities of the bike paths to be built".Pro Velo also criticizes that the government council had lost a word about the required supplementary measures such as image campaigns or more intensive traffic training.
However, the government council is correct with the assessment that the intended increase to 15 percent is too high.Per bike assumed when writing the initiative text that the proportion of bicycle traffic has increased since 2000.This has proven to be wrong, admits Durner.
The proportion had dropped slightly.«We are ready to compromise on this point.»(STH)

Government does not want a new law for bike support / / Ark.A few days ago, Economic Director Rita Fuhrer was a guest at the Pro Velo des canton of Zurich and emphasized her connection with the cyclists.However, this now has an end when assessing the popular initiative “For more bike”.
The government council rejects the desires launched by the Pro Velo.It requires promotion of bicycle traffic.The proportion of the path stages covered in agglomerations is to be increased to 15 percent, the initiators demand.
In Winterthur, the proportion is currently 10 percent, in Zurich only 4 percent.The government council considers the 15 percent claim to be "hardly feasible" according to a message.Compared to public transport and motorized private transport, the bike is "no equivalent everyday transport and also very weather -dependent for all road users.
The government is also concerned with the government.However, it is neither necessary nor sensible to issue a new law.In their view, the road law already contains sufficient regulations for the construction and maintenance of bike.
In addition, CHF 13 million from the street funds are reserved for this purpose every year.In addition, the federal agglomeration program provides for investments of CHF 213 million for foot and bike path projects in the Zurich centers for the next 15 years.The Pro Velo was slightly disappointed in a reaction, but was not surprised by the government council's statement.
She doubted that there is enough foundations to promote bicycle traffic.There is no strategy for the expansion of the cycle path network, writes the cantonal bike lobby.A lot of money is planned in the agglomeration programs, but the question arises as to how much of it will actually be available.
On the other hand, the government is correct with the assessment that a bike share of 15 percent is too high at all stages.Here you are ready to compromise, it says in the message.Pro Velo wants to stick to the initiative, but she hopes that the cantonal council will work out a counter -proposal.

Young Greens are calling for a Veloverleihnetz / / Zurich.- Similar to Paris, it should also be possible in the entire canton of Zurich to spontaneously rent a bike on all important points.
This is what the cantonal council members Lars Gubler (Uitikon) and Claudia Gambacciani (Zurich) from the young Greens with a postulate.Paris put such a network with 1450 loan stations and 20,600 bicycles into operation last year under the name “Vélib’ ”, which can be rented for a small fee and can be returned at any station.In Paris, one euro is requested for a one -day rent (with a depot).
Similar measures to promote environmentally friendly and health -promoting bicycles are also available in other European cities, for example in Copenhagen, where the bicycles are free.According to the two young cantonal councils, such a system is "easy to implement", especially if partners such as the transport association could be won.(KLR)

Higher contributions / / The IG Velo Region Spiez must increase the annual fee by a third.The revenue of the bike exchange has been missing for two years.
The IG Velo Region Spiez must increase its annual contribution for members from CHF 20 to CHF 30.This is because the revenue of the bike tour has been missing for two years and, on the other hand, membership fees for the Velojournal and for the umbrella organization Pro Velo Switzerland are no longer compensated for.The record of 2007, the President's annual report, such as the annual accounts and budget 2007, were unanimously approved at the general assembly.

Velos get stuck in the basement / / Timm Eugststervon Better bike routes hope that the cities hope for a transfer effect.
The opposite has happened: the bike content decreases - even strong in children and adolescents.Zurich wants to move forward - by Velo:
The Limmatstadt auto-worst makes great efforts to lock up closer to the Velo-Paradiesen Basel, Winterthur or Burgdorf.The network is already acceptable, the signage is exemplary, marketing with the slogan “Mobility is culture” is imaginative and the service comprehensively: If desired, the civil engineering office even tinkers the best bike connection to the desired goal, an online tool is in preparation.
By 2010, the bike share of overall traffic is expected to increase by two thirds compared to the year 2000.The detailed evaluation of a Switzerland -wide survey on traffic behavior has now been all the more disappointed: in 2005 the Zurichers were no longer driven in 2005 compared to 2000, but fewer bicycles.
Current velo counts on the streets confirm the finding: An unbroken downward trend follows the significant increase until the century summer 2003.A low consolation for the Zurich is that this downward trend can be determined nationally and does not keep up in front of the Velo Grossagglomeration (see table).
How strongly the city of Basel was recorded by the regional trend is unclear: the building department has dispensed with a detailed evaluation.Until 2004, Velo counts have a “stagnant to just rising” trend, says Barbara Auer from the “Slow traffic department” in the building department - she has no newer figures.
According to the population survey, the bike content of overall traffic is stable to minim."There are no less bicycles on the Basel streets, but in competition with public transport and car, the bike could have lost shares," Auer sums up her level of knowledge.Now the data situation is to be improved.
Disillusioned.Auer speaks of a "certain disillusionment" among bike sponsors all over Switzerland: "The improved infrastructure has promised a significant increase.»
For the Zurich civil engineering office, the new figures are simply "surprising" given the "achieved improvements".Pro Velo Zurich also praises the city's efforts.Managing Director Dave Durner is so “unsightly surprised” by the lack of success that he no longer considers the demand of his own pending popular initiative to be realistic for tripling the bike content.
Now Pro Velo hopes for a more moderate counter -proposal for the parliament.Dominik Lehner, President of Pro Velo Basel, is less surprising: «We know these questionable numbers.»
He wants to give countermeasures in both Basel with two initiatives, the implementation of which has not yet been decided on the board: the first wants to anchor bike promotion in the cantonal constitution, the second demands in the sense of a "acceleration initiative" the rapid "elimination of notoriously known" gaps inNetz - in Basel, for example, the missing direct connection from Bahnhofplatz to Gundeli.FEAR .
The Velo friends find it difficult with the question of why the improvements already achieved have not prompted people to change trains."I don't know," says Lehner, his Zurich colleague Durner has "a lot of ideas, but no explanation".He strongly worries the clear decline among children and adolescents who travel (see graphic and interview).
"Apparently the bike is no longer hip for many young," suspects Durner.He also sees a strong competition through the further expanded offer in public transport: «We used to rely on the bike when we wanted to come home after midnight - today you take the night bus.»
Also during the day, Durner see how Auer sees strengthened public transport as strong, more comfortable competition for bike.Lehner suspects the most important reason in the fear of traffic: "Many potential cyclists say: That is too dangerous for me." BAZ-FORUMWILE is less bike?
Did people become too lazy?Or are the bike paths too dangerous?Where are the biggest problems around Basel?

Bicycle drivers have fear / / Michael Rockenbach, Timm Eugsterdie Swiss cities rely on the bike content increasing in traffic.
Hope has not fulfilled.Now Pro Velo is checking initiatives to give the bike swing in both Basel.
The authorities believed in the success of their work: in Basel they made retouching on the bicycle network, with which they were already satisfied and in Zurich they massively expanded the poor network and started advertising campaigns.This would significantly increase the proportion of bicycle traffic in overall traffic, according to hope.
Nothing has become of this: the bike content decreases in Switzerland - especially in the agglomerations of Basel and Zurich, as studies now show.Authorities and private bicycles are at a loss.
Traffic researchers, on the other hand, believe that they know the cause."The continuously increasing car traffic displaces the bicycle travelers from the streets - especially the children," says Marco Hüttenmoser from the Kind and Traffic network.In fact, according to a Zurich survey, every fourth regular and only every sixth occasional cyclist feels on his vehicle - safety receives bad grades.
In the current Basel population survey, every fourth states that the situation for bike travelers had improved - five years ago it was every second.Gaps .Now the offensive goes on the offensive:
The board checks two initiatives.In both Basel, gaps in the cycle path network are to be eliminated quickly and the consistent promotion of bicycle traffic in the constitutions is to be anchored.In the Basel area, the civil engineering office is already acting:
It has recently been the case to uncover the weaknesses on the net.Clerk Jürg Widmer dampens the expectations.In the case of road projects, the needs of cyclists would often play a rather subordinate role, he admits.
The consequences are felt by the cyclists every day.As a BAZ test recently showed, the bike path network in the Agglomeration Basel is tight, but there are still some very dangerous places.& gt;

The new Bernese Velostadt Plan has been available quickly and safely through Bern / / since yesterday.For the first time, surrounding communities were mapped.
City councilor Regula Rytz and Bike-OL world champion Christine Schaffner tested the card in a small competition.Just the moment Regula Rytz swings to the bike, the rain begins.
Together with eight other cyclists, the municipal councilor tests the new bike city plan of the city of Bern in an orientation run.It was the last time twelve years ago since the last bicycle card was published.For the first time, the plan is now available as a digital drawing.
In addition, the map area was expanded to the surrounding communities of women's caps, backlogs, uettligen, Worblaufen, itemigen, bossy and gümligen.25 volunteers have left all streets and paths in the city and agglomeration in over 600 working hours, collected data and marked delicate spots.They have entered bike parking spaces, bicycle shops and much more and marked gradients.
For Pro Velo Bern, which sells the Velostadt Plan, the present work is "a decades project", as Pro-Velo President Stefan Jordi said at a media conference yesterday. "Certainly through the traffic", the Velokarte cost around CHF 70,000.The financing was carried out far through the Foot and Velo Transport department of the city of Bern.However, the project is also supported by the cantonal lottery fund, the surrounding communities in Ittigen, Köniz and Zollikofen as well as the Libero tariff association and advertisers.
The card work is not only intended for those who want to drive through the city as quickly as possible, said Stefan Jordi, but also for inexperienced cyclists or families with children who want to “get through traffic as safe as possible”.The fact that the surrounding communities are now covered, the card is also "ideal for commuters" .rytz Mags comfortably for Christine Schaffner, the bike-OL world champion from 2006, the trip through the Nordquartier is a child's play.
In exactly ten minutes she found the five posts.With Regula Rytz it takes a little longer.Perhaps it is because, according to her own statements, she is "more of a cozy bike driver".
Or is it the syringe that the dentist gave her in the afternoon?In any case, the municipal councilor needs almost twice as long for the route. ”The plan is great,” grumbled wife as a municipal councilor when she arrives at the finish line.«Unfortunately, I couldn't read it properly without glasses.
And when I put on my glasses, I couldn't see anything because of the continuing rain. "" City of the short distances "Bern was the city of short distances, said Rytz at the subsequent press conference.The bike is a cheap, healthy, environmentally friendly, quick means of transport.With the present bike city plan, cycling is becoming even more attractive.

Switzerland mobile - Slow traffic à gogo / / from April 25th there are 22 national and over a hundred regional several stages for bicycles, hiking, biking, paddling and inlines skates in Switzerland.In addition a unique service.
From David Coulin Switzerland Mobil means a lot: based on the routes of the routes of Veloland Switzerland, 12,000 kilometers of hiking trails, bike paths, inline distances and paddle stages have been signposted.It is unique worldwide that a uniform standard applies to the signaling of all slow traffic disciplines.
The interactive internet platform is just as unique, on which, from April 26, detailed information on the routes can also be downloaded.Even more: The approximately 500 stages are linked to the public transport offers.In addition, 57 illustrated route guides appear in three languages and with an entire starting circuit of 200,000 copies.
With these guides and a modern Natel (with a Beetagg, which means that it can recognize graphic codes), it is even possible to access the accommodation on the journey to the electronic list of overnight stays in the accommodations that are more than 500 by Switzerland.Slow tourists Welcome CHF12 million has cost Switzerland Mobil so far, 400 to 500 million francs of additional added value annually, the initiators promise nationwide.
This number is not taken out of air.For example, users of the Veloland routes bring around 600 logging nights to the city of Solothurn.Peter Anrenig, Managing Director of the Swiss Foundation, sees great potential for new guests, especially in the European surrounding area.
"But in Switzerland we will also be able to inspire many people for slow traffic." This can confirm Ruedi Jaisli.His company Swiss Trails is responsible for the bookable offers from Switzerland Mobil.
"Hundreds of guests and travel providers have already booked package arrangements with us," he says."Forty percent each come from Switzerland and Germany, the rest is spread out all over the world." Many customers did not find that Switzerland Mobil already found many customers before the inauguration of the new route network (on April 25).Because there is nowhere else in the world that is offered on the national routes.
Anyone who Bays Bay, benefits from a central reservation service for the partner hotels in three comfort and price variants- including luggage transport and 20 percent bonus on the rail or bus ticket as well as the option of renting tours, mountain bikes or racing bikes."People appreciate that an attractive route network is associated with an accommodation package of accommodation, bike rental and luggage transport, a package that is then adapted to your needs," says Ruedi Jaisli.Combination according to the desired thanks to the new route network, it is also possible to put together individual courses on your own.
For example in Solothurn.Nowhere else in the country are so many important national or regional routes of all these slow traffic areas as in the Aarestadt (see map below).You only need to bring the inline skates and the hiking shoes with you, country bikes can be rented at the train station.
And you can already swarm out in all directions: with the country bike on the mountain route to the Weissenstein, where the well-known Jurarou is carried out by Bikeland Switzerland, or comfortably along the Jura south foot to Olten, from where you can go back to Solothurn on the train, from where you can go back to SolothurnWith the inlineskates along the Aare alluvial land to Biel or on foot on the Seeland-Solothurn-Weg to Erlach.Only for paddle fun on the Aare is it advisable to use one of the bookable offers including a guided tour (Swiss Trails or other organizers).
Leave the rental device behind is possibly the support of this company if you want to try out the most sophisticated use of the new networks: a multi-stages program with various sports equipment.Why not even from Biel to Solothurn with the bike, then continue with the bike to Baden, from there on foot over the lusters to Dielsdorf and finally with the inline skates to Kloten?"Basically, on request, it is possible for us to put together almost any variants of multi-discipline course on the widely branched route network," says Ruedi Jaisli.
"Luggage transport, return transport of the rented bicycles and mountain bikes, reservations of the accommodations - everything included." Hotels win customer von Switzerland Mobil will primarily benefit hospitals along the new route network.
In Solothurn, for example, this is the Hotel Ambassador on the Veloroute between the train station and Aare.The small, fine business hotel has discovered slow traffic.Thanks to her, the house is better utilized in summer and during the weekends when the business people fail. "We enjoy the colorful audience, from professor to the Büezer, which in this way finds the way to us,» says Hotelier Walter im Obersteg, and: "We have specially purchased a stand pump and patch stuff for broken bicycles." Despite great success with the cyclist audience, these utensils have never used in the Obersteg.
Maybe he will soon have to get her out of the basement.Then when the first paddlers come with licking rubber boats.He will receive the first group right after the opening of the Switzerland-Mobil route network.
The slow-up season begins with friends of slow (or fast) muscle power traffic every year at the slow-up events.A few dozen kilometers of streets are reserved for cyclists, bikers, skaters, trottinettler and hikers on a weekend in a scenic area.
This year it starts on Sunday, April 27th, at Lake Murten.From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the streets around the lake - all paved - are closed to motor vehicles.The service along the route is organized for bicycles and for people, additional attractions make the slow-up to the folk festival.

Too many weak points / / from Bastien Girod*good that the "Tages-Anzeiger" takes up the bike problem.However, if the bike content in the city of Zurich stagnates in 7 percent of all driven paths, this does not mean that a bicycle promotion is not possible, but rather that the previous measures were not effective enough.
Cities like Winterthur with 11 percent, Munich with 15 or Groningen (NL) with almost 50 percent show that the originally targeted 12 percent for Zurich are a very achievable goal.The previous measures have too little effect because they are all very selective: some yellow stripes here, there, a signaling, since a bike station.But Ruedi Ott from the city administration also admits that the quality of a bike route is usually determined by the weakest link in the Veloweg: so by confusing crossings, crowded main lines or other unpleasant bicycle situations.
However, hardly any improvements have been achieved here in recent years.On the contrary, the increase in traffic pressure as well as visible, wide off -roaders have even worsened the bike safety of intersections.As a result, the selective improvements do not even come into play.
This is particularly true for children: their mothers justifiably measure the security based on the most delicate areas of the path.A serious bike promotion must get the real weaknesses under control.
This is not primarily a cost, but a political question.On cantonal roads, the canton, otherwise the city, has to consistently defend the space for the cyclists.Yellow stripes are already gratifying, but they are only half the solution.
Because too often they are blocked by trucks or wide passenger cars.Relaxing and calming for cyclists are structurally separated routes.Such continuous routes across Zurich would be real improvements, which would also increase the bike content for young and old.
However, a structural separation must not mean that the Veloweg is simply banished to the sidewalk, as the city of Zurich unfortunately regulated in various places (see current blog at www.veloaergernisse.ch).I know cases of bike drivers who, despite correct behavior, were pushed on such pedestrian bike path mixtures by angry footballers.This is less bad than thrusting cars, but it can also be reason enough, but it is better to use the tram or car.
I do not agree with the conclusion that the advantages of the bike have to be communicated better.Even if "only" 7 percent of all ways are covered by bike, a large part of the Zurich people from time to time use the bike and then learn the reality of everyday life.The annoyances experienced are not imaginations and therefore cannot be cured with PR therapy.
Rather, traffic planning has to improve security for cyclists on the entire working, shopping and school routes.* Bastien

More security for bicycles / / At this year's general meeting of the Pro Velo Region Thun, city planner Hansueli Graf showed examples of bike funding in Thun.The goal is:
More security for the non -motorized two -wheelers.René Lüthi, President Pro Velo Region Thun, would like to improve cycling in Thun.In order to show the members examples and opportunities for bike promotion in Thun, he invited city planner Hansueli Graf as a specialist on the part of the city. "There are always conflicts of goal in traffic planning," emphasized Graf right from the start.
For example, the widening of the Frutigenstrasse by Poller between the two lanes is a bicycle -friendly solution, but you have to be careful not to pour the streets with too many bollards and pedestrian strips.Because the flow of traffic must be able to be guaranteed both towards the center and outside.The safety of the wheel strips that lead via rail rails and high sidewalk boundaries, which can become a danger when the street can be utilized, also spoke in a lot of things in Planunggraf.
"The crossing of the railways is well solved on the Seestrasse," says Graf.However, it is less good to bad on the Kasernenstrasse.According to Graf, a renovation is necessary there.
As far as well -made sidewalk reductions are concerned, he refers to Lerchenfeldstrasse and the Hofstettenstrasse: "In the event of a shortage of space, there are enough alternative opportunities for cyclists." With regard to a more bicycle, other traffic measures are planned: The slowdown connections are plannedBahnhof-Selvariane and Bahnhof-West should contribute to calming and better feed.The lack of parking planning votes from the general meeting were loud when the inadequate bike parking spaces at the Thun train station were mentioned.First, there are too few and secondly they are too far from the train station, was a vote.
President René Lüthi wants to be able to better respond to such concerns in the future: "I am thinking of a specialist office that could explain our wishes of the city more competent and effective than ourselves," he said.According to Lüthi, it is to be hoped that Pro Velo region and those responsible for the city will maintain an even better cooperation.

How can the bike soil win?/ / For the bike expert Pete Mijnssen, bike promotion in Zurich is still a patchwork.
He demands much more targeted support at all levels.By Pete Mijnssen*climate change, energy saving and health concerns would be strong arguments for increased bicycle use.Nevertheless, bike funding hardly comes from the spot, as the last analysis of mobility behavior in Switzerland shows.
For children and adolescents, average bike use has even declined by a drastic 40 percent in the past 15 years.It is undisputed that people in the industrialized countries have to learn again to move more with their feet and the bike instead of the car.This would also be passed in Switzerland.
As the signator of the Kyoto protocol, she is obliged to reduce CO2 emissions by 10 percent by 2010.Today, however, the values are 8 percent above the 1990 reference value, the difference to this goal in traffic is around 2.6 million tons of CO2 per year.Since half of all journeys covered by car is less than five kilometers, they could also be done well with the bike or on foot: For the purchase of milk, summit or the newspaper you do not need a 1.5 ton car.
And you could do something for your health.Unfortunately, the development goes in the opposite direction.The number of short and very short trips under three kilometers continues to rise.
The city of Troisdorf makes it possible for an ecological reversal without major incisions.A study by the Infras advisory office commissioned by the Federal Office (Astra) (ASTRA) comes to the conclusion that up to 14 percent or 350,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions could be avoided by relocating to slow traffic (bike, foot traffic, public transport).The study calculates soberly and conservatively that 15 percent of all motorized path stages could be completed by bike or on foot.
In cities and agglomerations even a striking higher proportion.Studies from Germany and Austria come to similar results.However, three to four times as much performance in Switzerland would have to be performed on the bike.
So that means driving less car and going on foot or taking the bike.According to the infras study, slow traffic would benefit the most from the combination of performance-related traffic levies, access restrictions in urban areas and a redistribution of traffic areas.This would have to be doubled in the cities to 16 percent.
The city of Troisdorf in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia shows as an example of how with targeted bicycle funding the bicycle traffic share on all ways traveled could be increased by a third within eight years: from 16 to 21 percent.At the same time, car journeys dropped by 10 percent.The most important prerequisite for success was a large majority in politics, administration and the population for the cycling funding programs.
The traffic planning was behind the expansion program, implemented it and represented it offensive in public.In Zurich, the remaining area recycling promotion was too long in the city of Zurich despite the popular mandate for too long.The consequences are visible today on sidewalk and many bottlenecks and gaps.
Former bike officer Frans de Baan therefore concludes that "only a sensible rearrangement in favor of bicycle traffic would bring more security, more space, less noise, less aggressiveness and better air".The authorities of the city and canton of Zurich, unlike in the past, would have to meet this priorities.You must have a vital interest in the fact that bicycle traffic comes out of its niche existence, because the CO2 reduction goals will not be reached without the targeted promotion of bicycle and foot traffic.

Unemployed people bring shopping with Velo / / in Thalwil the new “Thalwil Bringts” project will start tomorrow: Bicycle shops transport home for two francs.
By Daniela Haagthalwil.- Two years ago, the home delivery service was only an idea of the Ökopolis association.At that time, the association presented the idea of a courier service operated by unemployed and wanted to know whether it arrives at the Thalwilers.
The market visitors reacted “impressively positively”, as the club announced at the time.When asked if they wanted to use it, most answered yes.In Burgdorf BE, the house delivery service was already a reality of the unemployed and served as a model for Thalwil.
Gianpietro Dinner said yesterday yesterday.The organic association was convinced of the idea, but saw that the implementation was not so easy.The association lacked money and personnel resources to operate such a service.
However, Ökopolis was able to convince the community, said Dinner.And a partner who has experience with unemployment projects was found in the aid organization HEks.The project is also supported by the Thalwil craft and trade association.
As of tomorrow Wednesday, bicycles are now part of the Thalwil townscape.The bicycles can be recognized by the “Thalwil Bringt” logo.Four flyer bikes with followers are in use.
In these bicycles, the fetal work is supported by a battery -operated electric motor, which is particularly facilitated by the hitchhike, especially when it comes to deliveries.The house delivery service brings the purchases home to the desired time.A delivery costs two francs, as the community announced yesterday.
How and where customers can use the service and how the project was financed will only announce the municipality at the official opening on Friday.All three sustainable project da, all three components of sustainability take into account, the community said yesterday: It was ecological, economical and social.
Instead of shopping with the private car, customers could get to the shops by bike or public transport on foot, and they would not have to carry the heavy bags home.The Veloservice makes shopping in the residential community more attractive and complements the services of the trade.And finally, the project deals with people without work.

Velo annoyance in the city of Zurich / / in Zurich there are bicycles at the running meter, TA slowed down from the 19th Maivelo -driving.Bicycle travelers have a hard time in the city.
In addition to incomplete route network, cyclists are often used as obstacles by having to mix with the rest of the traffic (keyword mixing traffic).This makes car traffic more attentive, slowed down and liquefied.
And money is still saved for expensive bicycle paths.But such a procedure makes cycling anything but attractive, but above all one thing: dangerous.It only happens too often that drivers want to get into a narrow piece of street in front of the bike quickly.
Or simply overestimate the width of the street.Unfortunately, the mood in road traffic is further fueled, especially among the braked.A real vicious cycle is created.
Successful in the short term, so cycling in the city is sabotaged in the long term.Not surprisingly, that bike travelers are looking for an alternative as possible, be it on the sidewalk or in a bypass or in the waiver.Is the bike a victim of modern traffic planning?
Mark Liniger, Zurichvelowege on pedestrian strips.Velo City of Zurich.As a bicycle driver who rarely drives Velo, I avoid streets in contact with the main traffic.
As a driver, I welcome a clear signaling of the bicycle tracks or bike paths so that it is clear who drives where, so the risk of accidents for both sides.There are ambiguities in the transitions of the bike paths across the street, in the pedestrian crossings: as a driver you can only see the pedestrian strip.
According to my knowledge, cyclists have to relegate the pedestrian strip.Like many bicycle or even Töffli drivers, however, rapidly come from left or right and dashes over the strip, so that as a automobileist you have little chance of keeping in time.A corresponding signaling or color marking on the road would be necessary here, such as in Germany.
The officers in the street building authorities could think about this.Eva Kirchberg, Islisbergzu steep for older Velocipeden.A lot was mentioned in the article, only the indication of the topographical conditions was missing.
Winterthur is (I think) too.In Zurich, man can only drive the Limmat and Bahnhofstrasse "just".Otherwise it is everywhere, partly “chaiibe stoty” uphill.
I suspect that the bicycles that are getting on in years keep up with it to the zoo up to pedals.But also Höngg, the Albisgüetli etc. are not very bicycle.That is why our bikes bought for Binz (located directly behind Witikon) stand around in the basement.
At 70 years of age we just don't like it.Hans P. Dunkel, Binzvelos disrupt car traffic.There is never talk that cyclists are often a nuisance themselves.
Anyone who drives the heavily frequented Bellerivestrasse by car will be stopped because it is used by cyclists, although bike paths next to this traffic axis were created.And if you still see that many cyclists block the traffic next to each other in pairs, you have no understanding for an increase in bicycle traffic.If the police were driving here just as consistently as when distributing park buses.

Most rental velos still rest in the stand / / Peter Schenkseit September you can easily rent bikes in Mulhouse.
The Grand Council also wants a similar system for Basel.In Lyon, Paris and Besançon it works excellently, but it is harted in Mulhouse.Since September 2007, the residents of Mulhouse have been available for borrowing at 20 bike stations that have been vivided onto downtown.
After a short familiarization period, the self -service system is easy to use and, above all, cheap.The first half an hour is free of charge (see the text adjacent)..While in Besançon, where the system was launched a week later, 130,000 awarding were already registered, it was only 29,000 in Mulhouse.
The two large spaces have similar population.In contrast to Mulhouse, 30 stations were set up in Besançon where you can get or give a bike.«Ten of them are outside the city center and work well.
There people change the means of transport, »explains Bertrand Maechler, regional director of operator JC Decaux.He adds: «In Mulhouse, the market was initially limited to 20 stations.Since there is one every 300 meters, we did not get out of the center.
“In addition, Mulhouse has changed its traffic routing with the tram so that you are sometimes faster on the other side of the city center than by car or bike."That certainly hurt us," commented Maechler.Jcdecaux originally sells advertising.
The idea with the loan velos was born out of necessity because the group was under great pressure through new competitors.In Mulhouse, the company has concluded a 15 -year contract with the Society for Public Transport in the Mulhouse (Sitram) area.He is strongly schematized in the fact that JC Decaux offers the rental bike system and is given the opportunity to market free advertising space such as bus shelter, for which the company would otherwise have to pay - this should be 1050 advertising space. Success in Paris.
The Vélocité system runs in Luxembourg, Lyon and Paris - there with great success."Since August 15, 2007 we have had 20 million loan in Paris," Maechler is enthusiastic.He hopes that Mulhouse will soon be more demand for Vélocité.
In order to achieve this, 15 new stations will be set up at the end of June, which are located at the university and the Multiplexkino Kinépolis, i.e. a little outside of the city center.Vélocité is to be opened further outside.The number of bicycles remains the same at 200.
«We want to increase the use first.In Paris, every bike is needed ten times a day, »says Bertrand Maechler.Since the loan runs electronically, those responsible have an overview of where and how many bikes are located and where they have to intervene to fill up or empty a station.
In Paris, it often happens in the city center that Vélocité users find no place to re-off their bike and have to start several stations until they get rid of it."This is less a problem in smaller cities," says Maechler.The operators of Locacycles, a social project that gives 135 bicycles, were not very enthusiastic about the competition.
It now wants to focus more on long -term rentals.Paris system.The regional director of JCDecaux would also be interested in the Basel Markt.
There, the Grand Council placed the order in January with 55 against 42 votes from the government to examine a public bicycle loan system.According to the dressmaker Jörg Vitelli (SP), Paris's automated system could be easily transferred to Basel.However, five cleverly placed stations in Basel could be enough. & GT;

It gets more complicated when I look for a person who explained to me how the system works.There is nothing to be done because there is nobody.Finally, I understand that borrowing runs on a touchscreen screen that is located next to the bike racks.
To get a bike, I have to buy a subscription first.This costs 15 euros for a year, 1,50 euros for seven days.I decide on my test for the short subscription.
With a credit card with a chip, I store a deposit of 150 euros, get an abon number and have to define a secret code.With both codes, I can now borrow a bike at all stations in the city for the next seven days.The first half hour is free.
Then it costs one euro every hour and from five and a half to 24 hours it is free again.Stress.The first lending attempt turns out to be stressful.
I have to enter the number of the parking space, from which I want to take the bike and have 60 seconds after typing the subscription number and secret code to solve it from his park.It does not work .Back to the touchscreen and a new choice.
Again I have 60 seconds.Fortunately, someone who gives his bike is coming.He explains to me where the button is with which the bike is released.
It works. It works.I put the saddle up and drive towards the city center.The bike is heavy and only has three courses, but it is enough for the city center.
There is also a welded lock - with a clever system for closing.I quickly get used to my loan.It is more difficult to find your way around Mulhouse.
Where can I drive where not?This is often unclear.I decide to take the forbidden to take a direct way and put the bike on the other side of the city center again.
At the parking space, the bike has to snap in so that a long control tone sounds.Uff, worked.In addition, the journey was free because it lasted shorter than 30 minutes.
I go to Essen with a friend in the nearby restaurant.An hour and a half later I get a bike at the same station - now everything is much easier.In ten minutes I will be at the train station, stop the bike, it beeps and I go to the auto.peter.schenk@baz.chfoto Peter Schenkwenig.
Many standing bicycles, but no user in sight.Just like here on the "Porte Jeune", on the edge of the mulhouse pedestrian zone, it often looks at the "Vélocité" stations.Only 29,000 loans have been registered since September, and 130,000 in Besançon in the same period.

More funds for bicycle traffic / / The Cantonal Council's traffic commission plans to invest a total of twenty million francs in the benefit of the bike in the next ten years.The Pro Velo is delighted and ready to withdraw your popular initiative “for more bike” in return.
The government council had shown itself in March and rejected the Pro Velo Kanton Zurich's Pro Velo Cantonal Initiative.Bicycles are not an equivalent and everyday mode of transport compared to the public and motorized private transport.The concern that is based on the request to increase bicycle traffic in the canton of Zurich to a share of fifteen percent, which would have meant a doubling, did not describe it as unrealized.
The initiators have now also admitted that this goal was too high.Coordinationim Cantonal Council is now a compromise.
As the responsible Commission for Energy, Transport and Environment (Kevu) announced yesterday, it will submit a counter -proposal to the initiative to the parliament.It takes up the concerns of coordinated promotion of bicycle traffic and an increase in his share in overall traffic and anchor this goal in the road law and in the law on public transport.In particular, the canton of office should support the use of the bike as an equal means of transport for everyday and leisure traffic.
Per bicycle “very pleased” the core of the counter -proposal is a funding program for bicycle traffic for over ten years with a framework loan of a maximum of twenty million francs.According to Kevu, the goal is to continuously increase the proportion of bike in the overall traffic in the canton of the canton with planning, structural, structural and communicative measures.After five years, the government will reimburse an interim report on the progress of the measures initiated. "We were very far towards the initiators," said Kevu President Ruedi Menzi (SVP., Rüti).
The Commission basically shares the view that bicycle traffic should be promoted more.On the other hand, the Pro Velo was "very pleased" about the counter -proposal and judges him as a "milestone for bicycle traffic in the canton of Zurich".The Pro Velo is reminiscent of the first Velo Funding Initiative a good twenty years ago.
The loan added the construction of bike routes reinforced at the time after a counter -proposal.Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo, was almost surprised by the fact that the proposal for a funding program with a framework loan came from the SVP."It comes unexpectedly when the SVP is ready to spend money on bike transport," said Durner on request.
Kevu member Lorenz Habicher (SVP., Zurich) said that Economic Director Rita Fuhrer brought the idea of a framework loan to the Commission.It was also clear to the SVP that the promotion of bicycle traffic was ultimately not possible without money.SVP against Velo-paragraphers, however, represents the SVP minority in the Commission, which does not support the counter-proposal.
The reason is that the majority were willing to anchor the promotion of bicycle traffic by law.This goal can also be achieved with the traffic plan and through the agglomeration program, says the SVP."We didn't want a bike paragraph in the law," said Habicher.
The majority in the Kevu absolutely wanted to achieve the withdrawal of the initiative.Apparently she actually achieved this goal.The Pro Velo has officially announced if the cantonal council agreed to the counter -proposal, it would withdraw its referendum.

CHF 20 million for bike funding / / Zurich.- The Cantonal Council for Energy, Transport and Environment (Kevu) rejects the popular initiative “for more bike”, since it is based on non -reality assumptions.The KEVU, for example, seems hardly feasible, for example, the fixed numerical goal of the initiative to increase the proportion of bicycle traffic in the agglomerations of the canton of Zurich to at least 15 percent.
The initiators, the association Pro Velo Kanton Zurich, also reached this insight, writes the Kevu in a message published yesterday.Nevertheless, the Commission also wants to promote bike transport.It therefore recommends that the Cantonal Council submit a counter -proposal to the government council that takes up the most important concerns of the initiators:
The bike promotion is to be anchored by law and to take place across the office.A framework loan of CHF 20 million for the next ten years is also to ensure the financing of the bike projects.The Pro Velo association welcomes the counter -proposal and speaks of a milestone for bicycle traffic in the canton of Zurich.

The Zurichers are supposed to drive more bike / / / The cantonal council wants to promote bicycle traffic with CHF 20 million over the next ten years.The aim is to constantly increase the proportion of bike in all traffic.
By Liliane Minorzürich.- The reason for the cantonal administrative commitment to bicycle traffic was the popular initiative “for more bike” submitted by Pro Velo.This request requires its own law on bicycle funding;
The aim is to increase the proportion of bicycle traffic to all distances in agglomeration to at least 15 percent.Today the bike content in the city of Zurich is four percent, in the agglomeration at eight and in Winterthur at ten.The government council rejects the popular initiative:
The 1,5 percent requirement is unrealistic.The Cantonal Council for Energy, Transport and the Environment made it less easy and worked out a counter -proposal that does not sound quite as apodictic as the initiative, but goes in the same direction.On the one hand, the government council is intended to supplement the laws of bike funding with paragraphs, and on the other hand, provide CHF 20 million for a bike support program that is to run for ten years.
The aim is to constantly increase the proportion of the bike in overall traffic.The counter -proposal was approved yesterday by all parties except for the SVP.In the agglomeration, the room on the streets was becoming increasingly scarce, the supporters argued.
"It's about doing a legitimate concern," said Gabriela Winkler (FDP, Oberglatt).The counter -proposal is a good Zurich compromise.Benno Scherrer (GLP, Uster) said: «In the future we will be dependent on every cyclist and pedestrian who relieves public transport or the street.»
However, so that more people switch to bike, the bicycle promotion is needed, according to Willy Germann (CVP, Winterthur). The SVP's funding rejected the counter -proposal as the only parliamentary group - although it originally brought the idea of the framework loan into the Commission.According to her ideas, however, the demand for new law paragraphs should have been canceled without replacement, "since funding does not work by law", as Lorenz Habicher (SVP, Zurich) explained.Since both ideas had now been merged, the SVP could no longer support the counter -proposal.
Reservationser Rita Fuhrer (SVP) also registered reservations.The government is of the opinion that a funding program brings a lot.«But the counter -proposal provides for a mandatory increase in the bike content of overall traffic.
The government council, on the other hand, is very careful with such clearly defined shares. »After all, the cantonal council was called the counter -proposal with 112: 46 voices.The proposal now goes to the government council, which has to work out a report and an application.If this application is then definitely accepted by the Cantonal Council, Pro Velo wants to withdraw the popular initiative.

Broad consensus for the support of bike transport / / the cantonal council, an initiative of the Pro Velo rejects as unrealistic.However, against the will of the government's will, he plans the order to work out a extensive counter -proposal.
With its popular initiative “For more bike traffic in the canton of Zurich”, the Pro Velo has targeted a clear goal: the proportion of cyclists in overall traffic should be increased to 15 percent in the canton of Zurich.That would be an ambitious requirement even in the Velomodellstadt Winterthur, where it is at 10 percent today.
Incidentally, this goal is unrealistic for the foreseeable future with around 4 percent bike content.The initiators now grant this themselves. "Velo needs more space" How far their concerns still enjoy, was shown in the cantonal council for energy, transport and environment (Kevu).
An alliance from the FDP to the Greens formulated a counter -proposal.According to this, bicycle funding should in future be an across the cross -sectional task.With structural adjustments, the improvement of security, with campaigns to raise awareness or easier when transporting the bike with public transport, the everyday use of the bike should be supported with adjustments to the corresponding laws.
In addition, economics director Rita Fuhrer (SVP.) Brought in the proposal of a framework loan received by her party and is happy to be greeted by all other.A total of CHF 20 million should also flow into bike funding for 10 years.
Minne was largely in the council plenum yesterday."Let's switch a gear," called Sabine Ziegler (Sp., Zurich) into the hall.Gabriela Winkler (FDP., Oberglatt) spoke of a practical and reasonable solution.
Bicycle traffic doesn't just need more money, but above all more space on the streets, said Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur).It has been emphasized several times that the bike was to be included in the planning as an equal means of transport from the start.Lorenz Habicher (SVP., Zurich) explained why his faction does not follow the "lazy compromise": "We want to change bicycle traffic rapidly, but without laws.»
The SVP had no objection to the framework loan.Rita Fuhrer also skeptically commented on the counter -proposal of the Kevu.He still provides for an increase in the bike content, albeit without rigid goal.
However, the government is very careful to formulate guidelines for the so-called modal split of the modes of transport.The goal of the overall traffic concept, for example, to catch up at least half of the future by public transport is very ambitious, said Fuhrer.Withdrawal of the initiative
However, the government has announced the opportunity to revise the compromise found.The council rejected the initiative, but spoke to 112 to 46 votes, contrary to the SVP's request for the counter -proposal.
As Kevu President Ruedi Menzi (SVP., Rüti) said, he has given the order to develop a definitive counter-proposal in the sense of a general suggestion, but due to a relatively precise sketch of the government.If this fails in the sense of the majority of the commission, the initiators have undertaken in writing to withdraw their request.Funding was also a topic yesterday during the break in the town hall.
Eva Torp (Sp., Hedingen) handed over Rita Fuhrer to almost 2400 arches of the Velopetition Knonauer Office on behalf of the middle left parties and several regional environmental associations.The signatories call for a coherent and safe cycle path network that leads directly to the town center and the nodes of public transport.City hall for the first time almost smoke -freeshosho.
Yesterday, the ban on smoking in public buildings was for the first time for the cantonal council.Only word, no swaths of smoke met the foyer.The building directorate had installed a modern niche for notorious smokers in the cafeteria, which automatically sucks on the blue haze.
At the beginning of the session, Council President Regula Thalmann explained that smoking goods should no longer be expressed as usual, but to throw it in the container provided for this purpose.However, a special course for using the cabin is not offered.In a personal explanation, Susanne Rihs (Gp., Glattfelden) linked her joy about the ban on criticism that the town hall still lacks disabled access.
Hartmuth Attenhofer (Sp., Zurich) did not miss the chance for a moody request to the government about the "tubal".He wants to know how long it will take before the smoking cabin is listed and the ashtrays in the foyer of the town hall.Whether tobacco also consuming members of the government would have to squeeze into the cabin and all those who only wanted to approve a pinch of snuffing tobacco.
As a replacement for Thomas Kappeler withdrawn, Susanne Brunner (CVP., Zurich) put the vow.The graduate of the St. Gallen University of Applied Sciences was elected to the Commission for Economic Affairs.Building insurance .
Without a vote, the cantonal council approved the annual report and the annual accounts of building insurance (GVZ).More bicycle traffic.The Council has decided to work out a counter -proposal to the “for more bicycle traffic” initiative.

West bypass.Without opposition, a postulate of SP, CVP and EPP was written off on measures for public transport with regard to the opening of the western bypass Zurich and the N 4 in the Knonau office as completed.Four zeros.
The Council also rejected it to temporarily support four individual initiatives.None of the suggestions received only one voice.Two resignations.
With applause, the parliament passed two members from the city of Zurich who switch to federal politics.The green Katharina Prelicz, in the council since 2002, is moving to the National Council for Ruth Genner, elected in Zurich's city council.Alfred Heer from the SVP was already a member of Bern last autumn.
The farewell of the sharp -tongued army was conciliatory, which explained if he had verbally put on his feet in recent years, he asked for leniency.Choice and resignation.Heers successor as President of the parliamentary group, Hans Frei (SVP., Watt-Regensberg), was elected to the management of the cantonal council yesterday.
At the same time, he resigned from the financial commission that he had chased.Announcement.Lucius Dürr (CVP., Zurich) announced his resignation from the council at the end of August.
Against two -class medicine.In two separate faction declarations, the left side of the council protested against statements by health director Thomas Heiniger (NZZ July 2, 08).Heiniger apparently forgot that a majority on the urn had only spoken out against the legalization of two -class medicine on June 1, the SP complained.
The GP and AL parliamentary group expects the health director to choose his words carefully, instead of promoting even greater inequality in the healthcare system.From for the cranked.In a joint statement, the political groups of SP, GP / AL and GLP asked the government to do without slopes in Kloten after the decision of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation against the crazy northern approach and parallel slopes.

First counting station for Velos in France / / Strasbourg.As the first French city, Strasbourg sets up a system with which the bicycles counted and the information is immediately forwarded to a central computer, report the Alsatian daily newspapers.
The system consists of a magnetic loop and can differentiate between bicycles, cars and strollers.The first counting station has been in operation for two months and cost a good CHF 8,000.Another four or five are to follow in the first half of 2009.

Modern transport policy for Velos / / Bärbel Nücklessstrassburg is considered a bicycle city in France.
With a new counting system, the traffic light times can be adapted to the traffic volume of bicycles.The data should also help with the accident analysis.At least 130,000 people are said to be on bicycles regularly in the Alsatian capital of Strasbourg.
The number has been circulating since 1997, the last survey of households has been back for so long and since then Strasbourg has been considered the French Velostadt par excellence.It is in the nature of the matter that the number in 2008 must be higher.Yves Laugel, the head of the Strasbourg traffic control center (Sirac), even considers twice possible.
In view of the high number of bikes, the city had been looking for a technical solution for two years, with which the number of bicycles can be recorded as precisely as possible."Everything is not suitable as the basis for a modern transport policy." Magnetic loop.Before the music conservatory, within sight of the town hall, has been part of a magnetic loop of every bicycle, which is overlooked in both directions, since the summer break.
It can already be said that the city gets a more precise picture of the pushing times and can thus adapt the traffic light phases to the need for cyclists.In addition, Laugel promises how and where traffic accidents arise in which cyclists are involved.There were 122 in the past year. Counting points and cameras.
As early as 2009, four further counting points for a price of CHF 8,000 each are to follow so that the future accident analysis records more than one area of the city.All data forwards the magnetic loops to the traffic control center in the basement of the Strasbourg town hall.All Strasbourg traffic data are received on the computers in front of a wall of screens.
120 cameras collect recordings of traffic jams, liquid traffic and accidents and recently a computer has registered how many bicycles the counting point pass.In contrast to the old counting points, for which rubber hoses were attached twice a year as protection for the device on the floor, the new, more modern system is indestructible because the magnetic loop in the flooring disappears.The old data acquisition was also inaccurate.
"The facility also had to be attached on the street and counted the cars," says Yves Laugel.In addition, the drivers gave way when they discovered something unusual on the bike path. Central computer.Nonstop has been counting bicycles since August, the magnetic loops forward their data directly to the central computer of the Sirac.
The technology is also available elsewhere, but the fact that the data is continuously available via the central computer is a novelty in France.The magnetic tape also differentiates between bicycles, strollers and illegally passing scooters with an accuracy of 95 percent."In the past 12 minutes, 15 bicycles have been driven towards the city center," explains Laugel.
Up to 7000 bicycles run over the place daily at peak times, which includes one of the two of the city's most frequented traffic lights.The electromagnetic counting system fits well into a bike -friendly Strasbourg local politics - regardless of the string of the city leaders.Strasbourg cyclists have free travel on 470 kilometers.
1600 safe parking spaces are available in special parking garages (including next to the train station).In Strasbourg, bike is also tolerated in the pedestrian zone, provided the driver adapts its speed to pedestrian traffic."Unfortunately," says Laugel, "many do not stick to it.»

Certainly via Victoriaplatz / / The Association Pro Velo Bern has recently explained to flash courses on how bike drivers can behave correctly in neuralgian bodies.The association recommends caution and consideration.
The first course took place on the Victoria Platz.Shortly before the start of the first lightning course on Victoriaplatz, Daniel Bachofner, Vice President of the Pro Velo Bern association, instructs his seven helpers: "Our goal is to guide bike drivers safely and above all as a full-fledged road user over this intersection", he explains.
Pushing the bike over the pedestrian strip is not a solution.He still does not know how many participants will use the new range of courses.It is simply important for him that Pro Velo Bern marks presence on the street.
And if nobody comes this Thursday evening, he wants to make the difficulties of the difficulties on Viktoriaplatz with his helpers passing by randomly passing cyclists.Tram always has ahead of six o'clock there are six cyclists who are motivated to learn to cross the difficult intersection correctly.Daniel Bachofner and Benno Steiner explain the most important rules to the three adults and the three children:
“The legal advance applies on the entire intersection, and the tram always has advance of all remaining road users.“But the cyclists are lucky: the tram does not drive that evening because of construction work at Guisanplatz.
Now yellow light vests are put on and the intersection of the intersection is practiced from all directions when afternoon traffic.The student Tarim facuse moves safely at the intersection, and helper Evelyn Hofstettler praises him for it.Unteachable bike drivers
Bachofner is aware that it is not always the drivers who put the weaker road users in danger.Velorowdies exist everywhere and they would hardly adhere to rules.But these distances is distant
Per Velo Bern clear.«We can only point out the dangers.However, some cyclists are simply unteachable, »says Bachofner.
The next courses will take place on October 16 at the Henkerbrünnli intersection and on October 23 at Thunplatz.The lightning courses last from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. and are free.Pro Velo Bern will take stock after the first three courses and offer more if necessary.

Delivery service with Elektro-Velo / / Bern-City thinks about the possibility of a home delivery service via bike.However, the project is not yet mature.
What has existed in other Swiss cities and in Burgdorf for 11 years is now also to be introduced in Bern: a home delivery service by electro -bike for business customers in the city.Eliane Leuzinger from the Office for Environmental Protection and Martin Wälti (Office for Mobility AG) presented the project yesterday at the Bern City General Assembly.The project - coordinated by the city - is still in its infancy, it is not yet certain whether the shops in the city center are involved.
Anyone who should run the delivery service is also open."Nothing has been decided yet," said Leuzinger.The idea: buy customers, give the bag in the shop from and in two to three hours (appointment can be made) is the commission at home.
The service should be limited to the city limits.Wälti proposed as a possibility that the shops with CHF 100 annually and the customers take part in it by order with two to five francs, as is common in other cities.Competitor Westside?
Is the Westside shopping and leisure center a danger or profit for Bern?, Bern-City President Daniel Nicklès asked at the general meeting.With 55 shops, 11 cinemas, a bathroom and a hotel, Westside could not be a competitor for the city center.The city center has long been offering what Westside offers in mix.
The city center would benefit from the 3000 people who will move into the Westside.Nicklès also took stock of Euro 08. For the gastro companies, the major event was rather in sales, although some had benefited.
The Bernese hotel, on the other hand, made ten percent more sales.The level of awareness of Bern has certainly only increased internationally.

Again and again over the border / / Heinz Weberacht we cross the national borders on this varied bike tour around Basel, which you can also drive very well on a beautiful winter day.
The bad news: you will proceed on this tour.In order to compete as little as possible by car traffic, the route is somewhat complicated.
The good news: it doesn't matter if you go.Because various ways and ancillary paths are also attractive.And because we always stay near Basel, they can't really get lost.
We start at St. Peter's Square.Down the Petersgraben, go straight to the St. Johanns-Rheinweg and in the direction of the Dreirosenbrücke, during which new building was generously granted space.Then back to the Rhine in a loop.
Northwards we drive to the border triangle with the sleek "pylon", built in 1957. We are at the "Gate of Switzerland" - we learned this name at school.In front of us, the feather -light three -country bridge swings 240 meters above the river - exclusively for feet and bicycles.
It received the German Bridge Construction Prize in 2008.Of course we want to drive the award winner.To do this, we have to curve a bit through the port area, past the exhibition "Traffic Trefall Switzerland and our way to the sea" and at the Siloturm with its 52 -meter -high viewing terrace.
Shortly after the Friedlinger Zoll, we turn left to the bridge.Briefly through France.Now we have crossed a national border twice.
Until the end of the tour we will have brought it to eight border crossings!In France we don't stay long this time.We get to the Palmrain Bridge through an industrial district.
Right behind it goes right, then everything straight ahead, first along the highway, then below it, finally to the left towards Zoll Otterbach.Behind the customs leaders lead to the Trinational Environmental Center, which resides in Zaha Hadid's famous pavilion.The previously urban backdrop gave way to the designed nature of the “Grün 99”;
A lot of interesting facts, works of art and a brilliant playground on the edge of the path.English garden .A Veloweg leads us to customs Weilstrasse.

Switzerland has to accelerate / / / zebra crossing: Complete the children!
TA from 3rd 12th The Swiss Vekehrs infrastructure is designed with greater care than in many other countries.Unfortunately, conceptual mistakes have crept in over time, which have so far not been recognized too little.
Despite all assertions and commendable objectives (“Vision Zero”), the weaker road users are particularly difficult.A comparison with the leader Netherlands: According to the BFU information on the subject of “Accident events in Switzerland 2006”, the following number of traffic fatalities were counted per million inhabitants:
Passenger car CH 32 / NL 23;Bicycle CH 6 / NL 9;
Pedestrian CH 13 / NL 4. In the Netherlands, school paths are around 50 percent, working paths 30 percent with the bike (!).The much better performance of the Netherlands is not based on the fact that "everything is different" there.
The basic structure of the cities is very similar, car traffic is scary densely (the quality of public transport is clearly worse than in Switzerland).How then the good result?Of course, the devil often crouches in detail - but Grosso Modo rely on the Dutchmen more of traffic -psychologically justified measures and “double security”, Switzerland more on penile regulations, prohibitions and commandments.
For example, zebra crossings in the Netherlands are usually not placed directly at the intersection, where the street is most widely and is very confusing for drivers.Bicycle traffic is fundamentally separated from car traffic on densely used main lines.(In Switzerland, bicycles are still considered to be "vehicles", in a way they are equivalent to the cars.) The Dutch traffic planners are far from satisfied, diligently tinkering with the most secure infrastructure that - now existing - weaknesses of theparticipating people takes into account.

Velo initiative unintentionally withdrawn too early / / sho.After the government council had rejected the popular initiative “for more bike traffic” of the Pro Velo Zurich, the Commission formed energy, transport and environment (Kevu) and the cantonal council a broad alliance for a counter -proposal that goes far towards the concerns of the initiators.For this purpose, Economic Director Rita Fuhrer contributed the core of a framework of CHF 20 million in order to promote bicycle for 10 years.
The Pro Velo had already offered the initiative in the run -up to the debate in parliament.After the clear yes to the counter -proposal in July 2008, she did so on September 5.Too early, as it is now evident.
“For more bike” was the first initiative in the form of a general suggestion that is treated according to the new cantonal constitution.That led to confusion.Unlike the initiators, the cantonal council did not treat the business with the rejection of the initiative and the approval of the counter -proposal, but only liked an interim decision.
Kevu President Ruedi Menzi (SVP., Rüti) said at the time that the council had given the government the order due to a relatively precise sketch to work on a definitive counter-proposal.In a second round, this should have been compared to the initiative again.With its withdrawal, which was published in the Official Journal on October 24, the business and counter -proposal was legally completed, as the government announced on Thursday.
Because a clear political will to promote bicycle in parliament, the government council has now commissioned the economy directorate to work out a corresponding program by the summer.The Cantonal Council is to be presented to the Cantonal Council in autumn.Pro Velo was pleased, but in a message, however, the legal processes described as a state policy.
The initiative in the faith was withdrawn, a decision of the cantonal council, which is a counter -proposal, was really a counter -proposal.Contradictory opinions are circulated in the administration to interpret the law in the administration, writes Pro Velo.Therefore, the consequences of the individual procedural steps in general suggestions with a counter -proposal should be clarified.
For this, Markus Traber, head of the Office for Transport, has a full understanding.Those who are not a lawyer hardly look through, there are questions open.It is important in the specific case, according to Traber, that despite the early retreat of the desire, the will of the initiators and parliament is observed.

Every fourth trip in the future with the Velo / / Wolfgang Göckellörrach wants to move the citizens with a campaign to switch to the bike.This could be financed by winning a Germany -wide competition.
The Lörracher city administration and IG Velo bravely laid the bar on 25 percent: every fourth trip in the settlement area is to be undertaken in the near future."Today we are likely to be at 16 to 18 percent and get closer to our goal," says Jürgen Nef, in the town hall of the Head of Strasse / Transport / Security.
Today Lörrach is very suitable for cycling, Jomas Hofmaier, chairman of the IG Velo in the Lörrach district.The Swiss model was founded 22 years ago and stubbornly urged open one -way streets and protective strips that could be copied in Basel early on.Both have long been standard in Lörrach.
In the town hall, the cycling policy is actively operated and Arne Lüers is a proven bike expert of the cycling officer. Short ways."City of short distances", says Lörrach's mission statement.This applies much more for cyclists than for drivers.
They like to use that the bike is also allowed in the pedestrian zone - with a small restriction -: a not always conflict -free release, which makes cycling even more attractive and is envied by curious visitors to the Swiss Pro Velo.In 2009, the paths for the bike became even shorter: Grabenstrasse, on the northern edge of the pedestrian zone, is redesigned in such a way that there is enough space for cycling against the single -track direction.
In spring, clarity should finally be created via a bike station at the train station.Because the non -profit social working group of Lörrach could not be won as an operator, the city is doing a common cause with the Veloladen Follow me.He runs his business in a former freight hall right next to the train station and is expanding.
If he opens the building this year, Follow Me will also have space for a bike station on behalf of the city with final bike boxes for commuters, with a fast workshop service, a brisk loan velos, an info point and other service.Managing Director Andy Wochner will soon discuss what the city would have to use for investment and ongoing operation in the town hall with Jürgen Nef and Arne Lüers.How strongly the city can and wants to get financially involved will now be shown.
Thomas Hofmaier from IG Velo warns that the city had to realize a bike station with the same demands in quality, which Lörrach also distinguishes in other projects.The IG Velo also calls for courageous financial commitment from a Velolust advertising campaign that is prepared as a joint project.It is said to accompany the opening of the bike station and move with smart ideas to switch to bike.
Lörrach may even receive such a campaign for free.The city is applying in a Germany-wide competition of the Federal Environment Ministry, which can win four cities that promote foot and cycling in a special measure.The price for the four: a free image and information campaign, which a well-known advertising agency should cut to the needs of the winning cities.

"Velo needs a greater status in planning" / / interview: Peter Schenk for the Pro-Velo managing director is the Voltaquartier for bicycle travelers currently the most dangerous.
BAZ: How do you feel the situation for bike travelers in Basel?Kathrin Schweizer: Basel was the Velostadt in Switzerland for a long time.
In the meantime we have lost this title to Winterthur.But among the larger Swiss cities, Basel still has the highest bike content.This is partly due to the bike policy, but sometimes simply because of the topography.
How could Basel get the top position from Winterthur back?The bike would have to get a higher priority in the planning.The cycling network was defined in 1988 and is still not completed.
For example, there is no secure connection from St. Jakob to the SBB train station.But parking facilities would also have to be improved.We would be happy if bike parking spaces covered in the outside quarters could be offered and more space for Veloparking at the large Basel train stations would be created.
What is the largest danger point for bicycles in Basel at the moment?We find that serious or even fatal accidents occur primarily on streets at 50 km / h.Tempo 30 is probably the most efficient traffic safety measure ever.
It is probably the most dangerous at the moment in the Voltaquartier because there is hardly any space for Velo with the Nordtangente building for the bike.All road users are required there because of the constantly changing traffic situation.Suppose a patron gives you ten million francs for bike projects.
What would you like to do with it?I would like to build a bike parking at Barfüsserplatz so that you can park the bicycles safely and protected in the city center.And if there is still something left, I would invest the money in an uncomplicated bike loan system, as it already existed in Paris and triggered a huge bike.
But would it be necessary?I guess so .The bike rental is very interesting for combined mobility.
You take the big distance with public transport, for the fine closure you use the bike.Anyone who lives on the brotherwood may prefer to take the tram for the mountain, but estimate the nastier bike on the level.Such a rental system should not only be limited to the core city, but should also include the agglomeration communities. & GT;
Continued on the Wednesday of the weekly conversation e-mail interview from: Kathrin Schweizan: Basler Zeitung-Friend: Veloparkingein Spring cleaning for your bike issues and winning.

Roche chicane is preserved / / Ralph Schindel The small harassment built by the pharmaceutical company Roche had to be trimmed a little in the Solitude Park.The canton demanded that.
A small hedge at the Tinguely Museum caused great excitement at Pro Velo at the beginning of the year.The chicane built in November for traffic calming in the Solitude Park must be removed immediately, the two-wheeler lobby in February (the BAZ reported) demanded.Roche reacted slightly piqued to this:
Until then, no direct contact had been searched for per bike.This has now taken place.Kathrin Schweizer, managing director of Pro Velo, was also present at the visit to the hedge together with representatives of the construction and traffic department.
Conclusion of this inspection: traffic calming remains."We removed stones behind the hedge so that nobody is injured in a possible fall," says Roche spokeswoman Martina Rupp.Swiss had admitted that there are also black sheep in addition to many bike drivers who behave correctly, which are abusing the stairs next to the museum for acrobatic interludes.
In addition, the new hedge was trimmed to the same height as the adjacent bushes.Enough space .One criticism of Pro Velo was that it was difficult to get around the new curve with a bike trailer.
"The official representatives have now found that there is also enough space for supporters," says Rupp.The path through the Solitude Park was originally only intended for pedestrians.Since bike drivers repeatedly used the path despite the ban, it was finally released for unmotorized two -wheelers.

In a nutshell / / Pro Velo Freiburgvelo becomes the chiefachpro Velo Freiburg at his general meeting for a successful year.With an attractive program, the association will also work for human -friendly, gentle mobility.
With the "Bike to School" and "Bike to Work" campaigns, schools and companies are addressed directly to use the bike in everyday life.When it comes to traffic planning and at the political level, the tasks remain diverse.Even if the city and the canton have so far been doing little for the promotion of two -wheeler traffic, awareness of this has grown.
The confirmed State Councilor Georges Godel, who in his presentation declared the topic to be a top priority.The SP Freiburg demands this in a resolution.Because in addition to the 1500 post offices that have disappeared throughout Switzerland, the mail wanted to close another 500.
50 post offices are also in danger in the canton of Freiburg, said trade unionist Didier Page at the Congress of the SP Freiburg in Muntelier.The cantonal board made a resolution to the State Council, which was unanimously approved by the approximately 50 present.In it, the cantonal government is asked to “obtain the list of the affected post offices at the post office and to make it public and to announce absolute resistance to the dismantling» .WB/HUS

The municipality of Spiez is implementing an investment in security / / three traffic assurance measures for bicycle travelers and pedestrians in the current year.Entering three times in 2008.
Conclusion: won twice and lost once.Urs Urs Hofer from the Department of Safety on Traffic Safety measures in the municipality of Spiez, he has attentive listeners.So also at the annual meeting of Pro Velo Region Spiez.
"We cannot make big jumps with the 50,000 francs available annually," said Hofer.The benefit is still impressive.The Hondrichstrasse gets a 1.5 meter wide wheel strip from the Linder bakery to the forest entrance above the Siberia curve.
The center line is removed for this;This as a fuse to go to school for children and adolescents from Hondrich who visit the Längenstein school center.So far, no sidewalk has been realized along the Studweidstrasse, although some land sections already belong to the municipality.
Pedestrian markings are attached along the street to avoid parking.In addition, the speed on the street is limited to 30 km / h.High -speed drivers
Brake run of the Höhenstrasse In some, the parking lot at the Roggern gym is redesigned to slow down speed drivers with a narrowed lane.The execution project T30 Zone Holle later follows with the road renovation.Good news for bus users too.
According to Urs Hofer, the Neumatte stop receives a waiting house towards Spiez.In addition, the “Kreuz” bus stop is moved towards Thun to the Werkstrasse.Improvements in the crossing areas Stockhorn, Niesen- und Gurhallenstrasse are only possible in autumn 2010 when the sewage work is completed.
Success and failure Pro Velo Spiez is facing a quiet year, according to President Ruedi Zeller.In addition to the fact that he and secretary Heinz von Allmen definitely announced the resignation at the end of the club year."If we do not find a substitute, we have to discuss the continued existence of the association," added Zeller. "The expansion of the Spiez - Wimmis road was not based on our satisfaction," said Ruedi Zeller in the annual report 2008.
Due to the excessive truck traffic, Pro Velo had called for the expansion of 450 meters in length to 9 instead of 7.5 meters, and the continuation of the wheel strip and the installation of an entrance gate.For cost reasons, the municipality of Wimmis did not go into this proposal (we reported).For this purpose, the wishes of Pro Velo were fulfilled during the entrance to the Bethanienpark superstructure on Oberlandstrasse.
The intersection in the entrance avoids traffic jams on Oberlandstrasse.So that cars in the exit do not protrude halfway on the traffic, the street was narrowed at this point."If this narrowing affects the disadvantage of the bicycle, we will react later," promised the President.
Finally, a company on Thunstrasse resigned the delivery ramp in the general building application for the insertion of Pro Velo.The revised project now maintains the legally applicable road distance.Guido Lauper

A loner on the bike / / if songwriter Peter Sarbach goes on tour, then he does this in an unusual way: he drives the bike across Switzerland.
An encounter with the Oberhofer between Düdingen and Solothurn.The road leads from the train station through an industrial area, past a recently opened discounter and a construction business.The end of the village is reached around a kilometer later.
The traffic subsides.Peter Sarbach switches up a gear and accelerates on his old three -man brand Condor Delta.The guitar on his back and two pockets with the most alert, which he wrapped on the luggage rack:
The singer does not need more for his 30-day bike tour.«In the morning I already feel a pull in my thighs.But that goes on the bike after a quarter of an hour, »says Sarbach.
He has already completed a good half of this Tour de Force.Today the route leads comparatively comfortably Saane and Aare along Düdingen to Solothurn.No short stretches of Sarbach had to take the various concert organizers and their free appointments into account during tour planning, he could not simply put together the shortest route.
Therefore, after the appearance in Solothurn, he has to leave east again.For the third time he will drive through Zurich.«The last time I was totally done in the city.
In the meantime, however, I know how I get out of Zurich again, »he says of an involuntary detour.The longest route is still ahead of the bike musician: from Rikon near Winterthur to Langenthal.
Beautifully sunbreaded the slope behind the pubes Sarbach switches to the smallest gear and wipes the first sweat pearl from the brown burnt -free forehead."From the Springs sun of Eastern Switzerland," he says with a laugh and shows his equally brown -burned arms.«With the weather, I was lucky so far and even had to be careful not to get sunburn.»
The bike tour is not only a strenuous, but also a lonely thing: for days alone at the bike from concert to concert.Sarbach, who is more of a loner anyway, as he says of himself, enjoys this.«For me, the tour is also a kind of relaxation.
I don't read emails and I don't have a cell phone with me either.»Last but not least, loneliness is also a balance to the appearances in front of the audience during the day.At noon in a café in Aarberg, the songwriter tells that he was traveling in this way for the fourth time.
And after every bike tour he tells himself that he will never do something like that.However, once the sore muscles are forgotten, he sits on the bike again.Before he can rest on the sofa at home, Pedalt Sarbach still Pedalt a few hundred kilometers across Switzerland and, among other things, stops in Bern a second time:
On Wednesday he plays in the bike with Jan Repka, another bicycle musician from the Czech Republic.You can hardly imagine a better place than the bike workshop for the two.It is still a few kilometers to Solothurn.

Many cyclists have raised trouble about gaps in the bike route network / / The major checks.Above all, those who have to switch to other routes for months because of the many construction sites in the city.
By Daniel Zumoberhausthomas Schmid is angry.As a very correct cyclist, he never got a bus for 40 years - until this Wednesday.Since the other bicycle routes from Hottingen are currently blocked due to construction sites, he drove through Hottingerstrasse inland.
Traffic was dammed up to Steinwiesplatz.Instead of crushing past the vehicles on the right, Schmid cured the tram island with his borrowing and overtook the standing autocolonna on the left.Only at this point is the traffic sign “Right by Bypass”.
A marked bike strip on Hottingerstrasse is missing.About 20 police officers stood further at the front of Wolfbachstrasse, the two -wheelers, who had passed the island on the left.Schmid had to pay 30 francs.
The 54-year-old engineer emphasizes that he is not angry because of the buses, but rather over the months of bicycle routes without bypass.Schmid also comes across the fact that during the control, those bike drivers got away with the trottoir to avoid the column on the right. «Rules also apply to bike drivers» Michael Wirz from the city police says that traffic rules and traffic signs also for bicyclesapply and must be observed even with standing columns.17 Velo and 66 motorbike drivers were lost this morning because they had disregarded the signal "obstacle by right".
The place at the Verkehrsinsel at Steinwiesplatz is very dangerous, says Wirz.She requires special attention from the pedestrians because they are always surprised by two -wheelers.The fact that isolated bicycles have escaped that drove across the sidewalk is possible, but certainly “no doctrine” .pro Velo Zurich (formerly IG Velo) cases like that of Schmid are known.
Practically every day, large checks with a focus on two -wheeler traffic, which would be the lawsuit from two -wheelers, would have been used, says Managing Director Dave Durner.The regular bus activities of the city police against cyclists are very annoying.To beat up to cyclists has become a popular hobby in certain circles.
It is bad that the police prefer to embarrass themselves with embarrassing campaigns than to get to the bottom of the causes of the misconduct of cyclists or even to show fair behavior towards bike travelers.Durner: "It is a sad conclusion that the police have so far not taken the cyclists seriously and neglected their tasks." The cyclists are taken seriously, says police spokesman Wirz.However, the accident statistics show that both the number of injuries and the cyclists (each plus 17 percent each) have increased significantly.
The number of cyclists who had indebted accidents had even increased by 26 percent.Route 66 ends at the Stadelhofenvelo driver Schmid is basically in favor of the fact that incorrect bicycles are also lost.However, he finds the many construction sites and the interrupted bicycle routes "dissolved and maliciously".
The fact that only half of the 340 kilometers of roads in the city are provided with a uniform direction for bicycles is a thorn in the side.By the way: Route 66 of the Swiss Velonetz, which leads from Rapperswil via Zurich to Baden, is signposted via Stadelhoferplatz.There will also be built there for months this year.
According to Schmid, which has already unsuccessfully intervened in the city three times in this case, is not signaled.Thomas Schmid wants to continue to work for decent bike routes.PICTURE

Velohelme are also a business / / Andreas Albrechtder Basler LDP Grand Councilor warns of temptations, lobbying and pressure attempts in the security industry.
The BAZ recently interviewed some people to abolish the velovignette.A bike dealer and SP-Grossrat took the opportunity and also proposed a new law that a cyclist would have to control his bike every year with the Velomacher so that the functioning of brakes and light would be guaranteed.That would be a good thing for the Velomacher - I do not assume that this mandatory control would be carried out free of charge.
This is a small, harmless example of a major political problem: the lobbying of the security industry.Driving instructors lobby for mandatory traffic courses, bike fabric manufacturers for the Velohelmobligatorium, insurance companies for mandatory earthquake insurance.
Revision companies lobby for additional mandatory revision tests for non -profit foundations and clubs, child seat manufacturers for obligatory child seats in the family car.They all have our well -being in mind.And everyone has an advantage:
You are experts in your field.But of course they primarily lobby - who wanted to treat them?- for your business.
This type of business promotion is so clumsy and embarrassing that you wonder why the actors are not ashamed of it.But the method is effective in a perfidious way because it addresses elementary fears and security needs: the fear of people of a disorder of the apparently healed world.
The fear of the politicians to be held responsible for future damage if another security mopratorium is rejected.And the natural need from all of us that should be made for every conceivable event.Result: new obligations are constantly being introduced.
For example, the government council of Basel-Stadt recently spoken out for a bicycle mopperatorium, although the leading bicycle associations reject this.How can we defend ourselves against unpleasant pressure attempts from security lobbyists?We have to see through that there is also an economic sales interest behind every new security product.
And we, especially politicians, should become more aware that a happy life does not depend solely on physical security.It may be that one or the other new law could be prevented in the short term.But if personal freedom threatens to suffocate in the amount of regulations, and if the costs of prescribed security strain the budget budget up to the excess, nothing is obtained.
Self responsibility and personal freedom are important for a fulfilling life.We take care and we defend ourselves against false promises of salvation.We should become more aware that a happy life does not only depend on physical security.

Veolia wants to expand in the transport business / / UG.Paris, July 20th The French local transport company
Transdev is a violent tug of war that plays against a political background between the supply group Veolia Environnement and the city traffic company Keolis.On Monday, the report circulated that the state treasury CDC approved a transfer of Transdev by Veolia Transport, a daughter of Veolia Environnement.The CDC holds 69.6 % of Transdev's capital.
This message originally from the daily newspaper “Le Figaro” was quickly denied by a CDC spokesman: no decision had yet been made.Good addition to a takeover of Transdev (and privatization) would result in the world's largest city traffic group with sales of over € 8 billion.
Veolia Transport implemented € 6.05 billion in 2008, Transdev brought it to € 2.3 billion.The two companies complement each other:
In France, Veolia Transport is particularly active in the intermediate traffic, while Transdev focused on city traffic.There are hardly any overlap internationally.Veolia
Transport serves contracts in Germany, the Benelux countries and Scandinavia;Transdev is particularly active in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal.Transdev also has experience in the operation of street railways.
Playball of the PROFITION The value of Transdev there is no precise information.Everything depends on the evaluation by the Paris Regional Transport Group Ratp, which with your request to cede its share of 25.6 %, which had triggered the merger talks.The CDC announced in June, and it also checked the sale of its share.
Since she allegedly exchanged her share for a participation of 9.6 % in Veolia Environnement, there would be a value of around € 1 billion. The other interest, Keolis, has the state railway SNCF as the main shareholder (44.5 %), politics inevitably play a role.The temporary agreement on Veolia
Transport was allegedly achieved at the urging of the office of President Nicolas Sarkozy.Secretary General Claude Guéant had acted.The President of the CDC Supervisory Board, Michel Bouvard, prefers Keolis, who implemented € 3.3 billion in 2008.

Will there be free bike for everyone soon?/ / In Burgdorf, bicycles may soon be “rented” free of charge.The traffic and environment department of the building directorate once again clarifies whether and how such a project could be realized and financed.
What distinguishes train, Baar and Cham - along with the control base and the lake view - from Burgdorf?In these communities, everyone can use a bike for free to make purchases, visit customers or to take excursions.From the beginning of May to the end of October there is a bus in the three locations in a central location where bike is available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Each station is equipped with 15 to 20 two -wheelers, which are cleaned and patched by unemployed and periodically replaced by the operators.Any waiting times can be bridged over a coffee.7500 in the Sattelder bike rental, according to the initiators, "great popularity" is enjoying.Last year, a total of 7,500 bicycles were loaned at the three locations.
The project, which was launched 15 years ago, is supported by the Association for Work measures and the non -profit society of the Canton of Zug.The idea of making bicycles available to people free of charge have long been in the "pedestrian and Velomodellstadt", as Burgdorf likes to call themselves, says Susanne Szentkuti.She is a project manager for traffic / environment at the building directorate and remembers that at the beginning of this millennium a concept called "Bikes4free" was tackled, but was never completed.
As with shopping akleiim Kern, there was a system that should enable people to borrow a bicycle financed by sponsors and in the city in various places in the city around the clock.The whole thing should have worked according to the shopping shrine principle: the customer throws in a coin, takes a bike-and receives the money when the bike is returned.
Szentkuti does not know a second start -up “Bikes4free”.To do this, she knows that renewed efforts are running to enable the residents and guests of Emmestadt a wallet and environmentally friendly bike.A model that has been used in western Switzerland for some time and has parallel to the “mobility” system for drivers is conceivable for some time.
Not very free of charge Lausanne, Morges, Vevey or Yverdons-les-Bains can solve customers with daily, monthly or annual tickets and thus have access to bicycles at various locations.Only: This service, which is known in Romandia under the title “Suisseroule”, does not grant a free bike rental.The “Switzerland rolls” variant is also not free.
In Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Neuchâtel, Renens, Sion, Thun, Vevey and Zurich, bicycles are only moved out after showing an ID card and around CHF 20.The first four driving lessons are free;A franc is due for every further hour.

The Velostadt is preparing: 50 new rental stations for Zurich / / / Velos like in Paris: The city wants to build an electronic bicycle loan with 50 stations.500 rental bikes should be available.
And that is just the beginning .By Stefan Schlegelzurich.- After over 100 cities worldwide such as Paris, Barcelona and Lausanne, Zurich is now planning an electronic bicycle loan.
Urs Walter, the municipal bike officer, has committed city councilor Ruth Genner (Greens) to work out a project ready for the pan in one year.The most important corner values of the first stage have already been determined: 500 bicycles should be available at 50 rental stations.
Urs Walter estimates the costs for this at CHF 4.5 million - with annual maintenance costs of CHF 1 million.The planned system works with bicycles that are blocked in concreted stands.With a bathroom and a personal code, the tenants can unlock a bike and park again at another station in the city.
The great advantage of this technique is that the rental man without staff.Therefore, it can be offered around the clock.The respective user can be identified via the personal bathroom and asked to checkout if he damages a bike or does not bring back.
A deposit is expected to be deposited for the preservation of the bathroom, which is expired if the bike is not set back at a station within 24 hours.However, the disadvantage of the system is that it takes a lot of public reason."Where the 50 stations are supposed to find space, the unresolved crack nut of the project is," says Walter.
He wants to solve the problem within a year.He excludes that, as in Paris, parking spaces are converted into bike stations.
For the first half hour free the offer is not primarily aimed at tourists, but at commuters who want to get to the destination on the shortest way.The city wants to design the rental tariff according to the Paris model so that a rapid return is worthwhile.
The first half hour is free there.Only a few users take longer to get to their goal (see box), but the short useful life requires that you will surely get rid of a rented bike.There must be enough stations for this.
50 stations are very tight for the area of the city of Zurich.In order for the bike density to be comparable to Paris, it would have to be twice as many.Urs Walter also wants to buy another 500 bicycles for Zurich in a second stage.
Open doors are ramened with the planned electronic bicycle loan, the city meets a political demand for the municipal councils Franziska Graf (SP) and Daniel Leupi (Greens).Your motion is still pending.The parliamentarians would have “run open doors at the city council,” says Walter.
Due to the advance, the civil engineering office has also clarified whether other, less complex systems could not be considered.For example, the “Next Bike” solution, which has been tested with 25 stations in the Lucerne area since Tuesday.In this system, the bicycles are secured with a number lock.
If you have registered on the Internet before, you will receive the combination via SMS.The big disadvantage: the bike has to go back to the starting point.The city of Zurich also had to decide in advance whether it is single -handedly building a new bike loan.
The Greens demanded last year on the cantonal council that a rental system as in Paris is checked throughout the canton.But the government does not want to know anything about it: the bike density in Zurich is already very high.
In addition, Zurich has a good public transport network, and the rental of Velos is not a state task anyway."The urban project does not change this attitude of the government," says Anselm Schwyn, spokesman for the Cantonal Office for Transport.However, he announces a cantonal bike funding program for autumn, which “is even more widespread”.
But the civil engineering office is already thinking of expansion beyond the city limits.Agglomeration communities could also participate later, says Walter.He even wants the Zurich Badge to rent bike not only in the Zurich region, but also throughout Switzerland.

Since January 2008 you have (or must) accompany you on behalf of the mayor Freud and suffering from the rental cyclists of Paris.Initially, they were only allowed to report on the good sides of the Vélibs (Vélos en Libre service), which have been loaned at around 1,500 stations in the French capital since the summer of 2007: the most beautiful routes, cycling with pumps and so on.Not a word about the breakdowns: broken bicycles, non-functioning bicycle stands, chronically overcrowded or empty vélib stations.
For a long time, neither on the blog nor in the filtered reactions of the internauts could be read.Of course, this did not fit the critical internet culture.The Schönfärberi seemed so strange that Gildas and Marion became a favorite reading of the Vélib users over the months who finally wanted something to laugh about.
In the meantime, the truth content on the blog has improved noticeably, and the Vélib network is also being expanded.These days, 15 suburban communities are connected to the rental radiation system.55 million Customer and tourists are enthusiastic about the Vélibs: 55 million customers since the introduction in July 2007. JC Decaux, the private company, which is in a long -term contract with theRathaus has secured the exclusive use of public advertising space and in return operates the rental system.
The bikes are damaged regularly, and the topography of the city forces many elaborate back and forth trips with small vans.Paris is designed with bowl, with a low point in the city center.The bicycles like to cycle from the outdoor districts to the city center, where they often arrive at crowded parking spaces during bumping times.
This forces JC Decaux to chauffe the bikes back to the outskirts.With the expansion of the system to the surrounding communities, the number of motorized transports of the environment -friendly bicycles will continue to increase.Unless the Parisians can be persuaded to cycle uphill with the 22 -kilogram wheels.
If you rent the Vélibs in the less coveted direction of travel, you can now use it free of charge for an additional quarter of an hour.The Parisian Vélibs: 22 kilos heavy and especially used for desks.PICTURE

The future belongs to the Velostadt Zurich / / by Stefan Schleibelein pioneering performance, the city of Zurich does not work if it begins to set up a network of electronic bike rental stations, with initially 500 bicycles (TA from last Friday).Velo sharing already works in Montreal, Vienna, Lyon and Lausanne.
Zurich is a straggler, other cities also had the bike sharing more necessary.In contrast to Paris, cycling in Zurich was never a high-risk sport for eco-fanatics.The proportion of cyclists in Zurich is relatively high today.
The Velo-Mobility will therefore hardly lead to the explosion-like increase in bike drivers, especially since Zurich has a poor bike path network.There, the CHF 4.5 million that the Velo mobility will cost in the first phase would also be well invested.Even bike lobbyists are not very enthusiastic about the idea of having to share bike paths with unrouted occasional cyclists in the future.
The Velo-Mobility in Zurich will not even be ecologically, because experience has shown that the bicycles are usually rented downhill for the way to the city center.They must then be returned to the opposite direction with CO2 and costly with vans.All of these were good reasons to wait until elsewhere solutions for the logistical and technical problems of Velo sharing were developed.
But now that the rental bikes and the associated computer science work perfectly, Zurich is doing well to act.Because the electronic bike rental is not a gag for tourists and also not a nice but dispensable service for commuters.Velo sharing is the most individual form of public transport.
New path for the ÖVDAS VELO Spurt a new way to public transport: The future of local transport belongs to locomotives that can be served easily and independently and can be quickly transferred to someone else.Less sweaty means of transportation than the bike will be available over time: electric scooters, Segways or battery-powered bicycles.The individualization of public transport is not only necessary because passengers are reluctant to wait and change, it also enables an increase in capacity.
The rule says: Squeezing resources are used optimally if everyone can use them as long as necessary.The private car, which adjusts space all day and blocks the streets during the shock times, is pure waste.The constantly rolling public transport and the space -saving bike are more efficient.
The state cannot stop the much defendant trend towards the individualistic 24-hour society.He can only create incentives for the considerate of the best possible individuality.
For example, with bicycles available at any time and everywhere, because no other way of moving is easier tolerate in the urban environment.The establishment of a bike rental is clearly in the public interest.It is easy to finance if the maintenance is done by social employment programs and when private partners are won.
It is a good deal for companies to sponsor a bike in return for permanent advertising drives.It must also be ensured from the start that the Zurich Velo-Mobility is compatible with systems in as many partner cities as possible.Because individuality is not limited to the area of a city.

Zurich: "People are afraid" / / Many bike strips are useless, TA from 10. 9. Consequent separation.Ta editor Liliane Minor writes me with her comment on the self -appointed Velostadt Zurich from the heart - finally someone speaks plain text beyond polemics and utopias:
It is often almost forgotten that the bike is initially primarily a means of transport, and the most efficient in city traffic in many ways.Copenhagen has achieved a bike content at commuter traffic of over thirty percent with wide bicycles and consistent optimization of the green phases at bike speed.In other Swiss cities, people have long since understood that a consistent separation of road users not only gains security, but also space.
Zurich, however, brushes yellow bicycles without traces on the sidewalk, where it has space for it, and installed for expensive money traffic lights and signs that primarily prefer to slow down instead of preferring bicycles.Unfortunately, parking spaces are missing at traffic hubs, and unfortunately you are still in vain.In the case of popularity that the bike currently enjoys, a share of less than ten percent (falling) in everyday life can actually only mean one thing:
People are afraid.Christoph Steinmann, Zurich drive on the sidewalk.I wonder what the civil engineering office is doing, which has recently propagated the term Velostadt in inflation.
An inspection on the just renovated Falkenstrasse at the Bellevue shows how it works.Pretty much everything was done wrong: a Kafkaesker Schilderwald shows very clearly how once more incohering bike path fragments are distributed.
In addition, there is the unspeakable mixing traffic on the narrow sidewalk in front of the Ambassador hotel.It is only a matter of time before a hotel guest and its luggage are killed there.I always thought there was a reason why cycling on the sidewalk is prohibited.
Now the civil engineering office "forces us exactly.How many surveys will the city do before it learns something from the results?Michael Eberle, Zurichtic mixture.
The author is right if she demands bike strips, especially for dangerous bodies.Unfortunately, there are more and more dangerous bodies together with the dense car traffic, a fatal mix, as the statistics show.The applicable doctrine of the traffic planners is called mixed traffic, unfortunately mostly at the expense of the bike.
The new pedestrian islands are an increasing annoyance;The road is suddenly narrowed, there is no space for the bicycles.The same in front of circle.

Open the Opera House Tram stop for Velos / / Velo driver should be allowed to drive the Theaterstrasse in the area of the Opernhaus tram stop.This demands per bike canton of Zurich.
According to a message from yesterday, the association raised the city council against a recently advertised transport order, which provides for the blocking for bicycles on this section of the road.Velo Elsener also participates in the objection.With the completed conversion of Seefeldstrasse and the planned conversion of the Theaterstrasse between Bellevue and Stadelhoferplatz, according to Pro Velo, there will soon be a continuous bike route from Tiefenbrunnen station to Central.
"The blocking of the tram stop area between NZZ and Migros brutally cuts this route and forces bicycles on dangerous and long detours," says the message.It is not clear why this tram stop should not be accessible to Velos at all, criticizes Dave Durner from Pro Velo.In many other places in the city, this will already be requested by the bike travelers, for example at Limmatquai or at Stadelhoferplatz.
The conversion there is "truly no profit" for bicycle travelers: "A little closer than before, but additional water channels and curb edges.»Pro Velo expects the city to be serious about the intended promotion of bicycle traffic.
"The Theaterstrasse would be a good place to put this intention into action," said Durner.When it comes to traffic departments in the police department, one did not want to comment on the objection yesterday because it was an ongoing procedure.Pro Velo Kanton Zurich sees itself as a lobby of the bike travelers and fights for "the bike is perceived as a full -fledged means of transport".

Better bicycle paths in Zurich required / / MBM.?
With a motion, the long -term demands of IG Velo Kanton Zurich are to be given more reprint after better, safe and direct bike compounds in the city of Zurich.The advance was submitted by the municipal councils Daniel Leupi (Gp.) And André Odermatt (Sp.), Which are both members of the IG Velo and request a project and investment loan.The money is intended to improve traffic relationships for bicycles on the main streets in Zurich until 2020.
According to Leupi, it is miserable how little in this respect has happened in recent years, as he said at a press conference on Wednesday.He found the guilt primarily among the police, which does not enforce the applicable rules, and the canton, who prefers car traffic everywhere.Odermatt said the bike belonged to the street and not on sidewalk.

Velo drivers are calling for more space in the city / / of Benno Gassan of yesterday's press conference.Fast routes were missing in the city that existing bike routes are not recognizable, the bike is being displaced or simply forgotten during planning.
"The topic is frustrating," said local councilor Daniel Leupi (Greens).The main streets in the city center would therefore have to be equipped with safe strips or paths for the bike.At certain points such as the Bellevue, many cyclists would no longer dare to go on the street.
Many would therefore switch to the sidewalk.Leupi also mentioned a successful example of bike promotion: the blocking of the Limmatquais.Since then, the conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists have decreased from 40 to 3 percent.
Leupi made two main responsible for the defect: the police, who are not willing to enforce the safety of cyclists.And the canton, the car breeds, are more important than the safety of bike drivers.
The VPV therefore wants two large, circular bicycle paths with corresponding cross -connections in the city center (see graphic).Her claim underlines Leupi and colleague André Odermatt (SP) with a motion.In it, they demand a project planning and investment loan to make the main inner-city main streets suitable for bike by 2020.
The necessary routes are practically already registered in the regional structure plan, said Odermatt.The amount of the loan was unable to quantify Odermatt that he was over two million francs.Improvements in Sichtodermatt and Leupi showed examples of how and where they imagine such bike paths.
In two pictures the Talstrasse and the rope ditch with one -assembled bicycle strips and narrowed sidewalks could be seen.What can be changed on the screen with a few clicks of the mouse is more difficult to implement in reality.The urban bicycle officer Urs Walter believes that there is no space for a bike strip on the rope trench on both sides on the rope.
However, there is already a project for a bike path at Talstrasse.From the point of view of the bike driver, he described the Rämistrasse between Bellevue and peacock as a large problem child.«We have looked at the situation from all sides and have so far not found a solution.»
However, the situation will improve selectively in the next few years.In the Bellevue area, new bicycle paths are planned as part of ongoing construction projects, and existing routes would be better marked in delicate areas.The situation in the city center is not quite as dramatic as shown by VPV.

Bicycles can say the city's opinion / / the city participates in a survey among bike drivers with CHF 20,000.She can be prepared for criticism.
Tens of thousands regularly drive through Zurich on the bike.Now the city wants to know for the first time how the bikers are doing.Together with five other cities, she finances a survey by the Swiss Veloverband Pro Velo.
The city is currently advertising on its Internet site.In addition, a market research institute carries out telephone surveys.Among other things, the participants of the survey should say whether they “feel safe while driving” and whether there are enough bicycle paths through the city.
The city has to cost the survey of CHF 20,000.The cities of Bern, Basel and Lausanne pay the same amount, 5,000 francs each contribute to Winterthur and Geneva. "We want to know whether what we do is also an effect," says Urs Walter, Velobe officer of the city of Zurich.So far, the city has been limited to traffic counts and statistical surveys.
Five years ago, a similar survey performed for the last time - without the city's participation.At that time, Zurich cut off below average in all respects.The traffic climate was assessed as the second worst of all major Swiss cities.
For the security, the city's bicycles gave the grade 2.8th criticism of the city police "now we are expecting a significantly better result," says Walter.«The 2005 survey was primarily filled out by Pro-Velo members.They are naturally more critical.»
The new survey has reached significantly more people - so far over 5000. In addition, the city has created new bike routes and parking spaces since then, which is supposed to lead to a better performance.This contradicts Dave Durner from Pro Velo Zurich.
The last survey uncovered that the Veloclima in Zurich was miserable.«The city has not done anything.On the contrary, the city police always create a mood against cyclists. "" If this accusation in the current survey is confirmed, we will discuss it with the city police, "promises Walter.

Rita Fuhrer wants a bike lawyer - the SVP romps / / from Ruedi Baumannzürich - "A route from Zurich to Madrid comprises the Zurich cycle network," said economist Rita Fuhrer (SVP) in front of the media yesterday.That is 1700 kilometers - but only about half of the planned route.
For further expansion, the government invests 10 to CHF 15 million each year."But the bike alone is not enough," Fuhrer recognized.This has confirmed a scientific study that the government council had for CHF 50,000. «The
Zurich cycle paths are extensive, but largely unknown, »said study author Ursula Lehner-Lierz from Velo Consult.Together with the economics directorate, she has developed a funding program with 19 measures.In order to implement this, the government applies for a loan of CHF 20 million to the cantonal council.
Goal: According to Rita Fuhrer, the bike is to become a “everyday means of transport”, which “should play a major role at short distances”.The most important measures.With CHF 5 million, bicycle spaces are to be created at public buildings, hospitals and schools as well as cloakrooms and showers
5 million should be improved by the bicycle spaces at train stations, a bike & ride concept and bike acceptance in public transport.2 Millions costs the propagation of the bike for the way to work and to school.This also includes the promotion of the bike to shopping.1 Million is invested for better signalings, new maps, internet leaders, advertising brochures and the support of the municipalities in the planning. 4 million costs the training of private and public bodies, including in the communities thatAgain carry out bike courses or plan cycle paths.
Health promotion in schools is also planned.Velo paths have grown historically and were mostly created from a tourist point of view.They lead over the mountain instead of the shortest way to work, a lot is accidental.
Often suddenly end bike paths, or the decisive guide is missing.Therefore, Rita Fuhrer wants to use a bike lawyer who is not supposed to be a lawyer, but coordinator and contact person for cyclists.The salary is made from existing job percentages.
Greens: "Fuhrers Best Template" Rita Fuhrer had to listen to a concentrated cargo criticism of her party, the SVP, yesterday: "Bureaucratic jobber", "Except and band", "Floating of the administration".The Greens, on the other hand, spoke "of the best template in Fuhrer's term".The SP also praised the program and demanded another ten million a year.
The push direction also votes for the green liberals: "In our villages you need more bicycles and fewer cars." The bike support program of the government council "With the 20 million we have to come as far as possible" Dave Durner from Pro Velo speaks of a - albeit late - "milestoneIn the bike promotion ». How have you been a fan of SVP government councilor Rita Fuhrer?
No, I am only when everything that she presented today has been implemented in ten years.Then that would be a milestone in the bike promotion, which is a little late.Are the 20 million enough?
No, that's never enough.But it is what is available.We now have to go as far as possible.
The SVP speaks of waste and bureaucratic juggernach.This is unqualified ramblings.When more people drive bike, it helps to save costs.
Perhaps we could save several times when expanding the bus and train or in road construction.Also with regard to health prevention, every franc that you spend on cycling is worthwhile.You will find the Bike & Ride concept unnecessary, why?
You can save yourself the 400,000 francs for a concept.It is clear that the bike parking spaces at the large train stations such as HB, Altstetten, Stadelhofen, Hardbrücke or Winterthur have to be expanded.Affoltern a.A. and the Säuliamt, on the other hand, are good examples.
There is a need to catch up with the signalations.Examples?For example, the one -way streets open to bike drivers.
A pictogram should be painted on so that the drivers don't always turn on.Or where traffic -calmed local passages are built and cyclists are displaced on the sidewalk, for example in Birmensdorf.Interview: Ruedi Baumann better marking and good bike paths: The bike should also be promoted for the trip to school.

Mister Velo wants to go to the official house / / Daniel Leupi is the embodied bike promotion;And if a bike has ever taken on a human figure in Zurich, it will look like Leupi.
He is a co-owner of the Velobüro Olten, Project Manager Switzerland Mobil / Veloland Switzerland, managing director of slow-up, the car-free adventure days, and he was President of Pro Velo Zurich for over ten years.Leupi's first initial as a freshly elected municipal council in 2002 asked for safe bicycle routes around the main train station.However, it still doesn't exist.
Since then, around 60 other advances have been added with heavyweight environment and traffic calming - as expected from a classic Greens.From 2006 to 2009 he was president of the municipal council group.
Daniel Leupi comes from Lucerne, he studied economics in Bern, has lived in Zurich since 1995, lives in Wollishofen, is married and has two children.It was politicized by the forest extinction and the atomic debate.He joined the Greens because they seemed to offer him more individual freedom than the SP.
Why does he want to give up this freedom now and squeeze into the official corset of a city council?He wants to reduce parking spaces, although it is a city with a high quality of life, says Leupi, but there is still a lot to do for sustainability, especially when it comes to traffic.Unlike the red-green city council, he wants to reduce the number of customer parking spaces in the city center by 20 percent as soon as the SBB diameter line is opened in 2013.
Leupi also sees deficits in terms of bicycle promotion: the effort is available, but the crack nuts such as Bahnhofplatz or Rämistrasse would not be tackled courageously.The city council would also have to promote non -profit housing construction.
Auto -poor living and the dismantling of streets are of course for Leupi.Which also naturally brings the bourgeois on the palm.Doesn't he fear a legal slip if the city tightens its transport policy à la Aeschbacher?
No, Leupi refers to the last traffic votes, all of which have supported urban politics.The outrage mostly comes from car lovers who do not live in the city.In the election campaign, Leupi strokes his willingness to compromise in addition to the green standards and - as a trained economist - his heart for small and medium -sized businesses, which he underlines with his membership in the SME group of the municipal council.
Richard Späh, the head of the parliamentary SME group and president of the trade association, describes the cooperation with Leupi as pleasant.Leupi understands for commercial concerns, more than other Greens, but not when it comes to traffic and parking spaces.Then at least he holds back as pleasantly how that is the rule in the SME group.
Michael Baumer, the President of the FDP parliamentary group, confirms Leupi's willingness to compromise - but only as long as it is not about bike and parking spaces.Leupi aperture completely how important parking spaces are for the business.What Leupi denies and refers to his demand for commercial zones with lower rents.
Daniel Leupi does not reveal which one would be his favorite department on March 7th on March 7th.He does not get the civil engineering office with the bike station: Ruth Genner wants to keep that.
Personal “I like to play passionately” favorite holiday?Bergün, Amsterdam, North Sea Islands.Favorite book? «Ulysses» by James Joyce.
The largest truck?If that's a truck: I love to play passionately.Greatest youth sin?
My colleagues and I drove to the games of FC Lucerne with our bicycles or Töffli like a race.We cut curves and are slalom -like to the left and right on the standing car columns.Example ?
I have no role model, but I particularly like people who bring imagination and humor into other people's lives.Daniel Leupi: mostly friendly, but not in parking spaces.

Letters to the editor / / Velo offensive "The civil engineering office steps into the pedals", TA from the 2nd 2nd bike traffic has a lot of potential.I very much welcome the city's “Velo 12” bike promotion project.
Because the situation for cyclists in Zurich is very bad: there is a lack of separate traces for the various road users, the Velonetz is often badly marked and incomplete.Today I was looking for a bike path in vain on the newly renovated Seebahnstrasse, which is really very wide.
In order to increase bicycle traffic to 12 percent by 2012, there are still many improvements.However, other cities such as Münster, Amsterdam or Copenhagen show that this goal is possible, in which the bike content is between 30 and 40 percent.Even if Zurich is not as ideal as the flat Amsterdam, bicycle traffic has a huge potential.
Thomas Stahel elections "what it looks like in parliament and could soon look", TA from February 13, FDP 3 will defend seat.The forecast that the FDP in district 3 could lose the only seat should hardly arrive.
In the last elections, 6 percent were enough to get hold of a seat, the FDP, with its 8.6 percent, still has reserves from the last elections.In addition, the top candidates are not as unknown as it is claimed.Cäcilia Hänni, the candidate at list place 1 and district party president, had a very good presence and was found in many public appearances in the neighborhood.

Rot-Grün failed at the Velonetz / / Stefan Hänen about the increasing number of bike accidents in the city of Zurich.The Winterthurers are generally evident when it comes to cycling in their city.
With a two -thirds majority, they decided in autumn to close a 170 -meter -long bike path in the city center.Costs: CHF 800,000 per meter is a proud CHF 4,700.But the investment is worth it:
After completing the construction, the cyclists no longer have to take a delicate detour in the busy center - a danger stove is defused.The example is impressive: the red-green ruled Winterthur wants to perfect its cycle path network and thus strengthen its reputation as a bike city.
Anders Zurich.The Veloweg network has been a single patchwork for years, and this in a traffic climate with high density stress.The consequences are fatal:
If the cyclists have too little space on the street, they create freedom - to the annoyance of drivers, which are all the less considerate of cyclists.The increasing number of bike accidents is not least an expression of this vicious circle.It is a certificate of poverty for the city of Zurich that its bike funding has remained so far, especially with a view to the goal that the city is aiming for with the blessing of the voting person: the 2000 watt society.
The failure is all the greater because red-green in the Zurich city and municipal council holds the tax in hand.The responsibility is not only Martin Waser (SP), who managed the responsible civil engineering department between 2002 and 2008.His successor, the Green Ruth Genner, also has to be chalking up that the dossier has not been tackled for one and a half years.
With her recently announced funding program “Velo 12”, she tries to at least remedy the worst failures of the past.This is a first step in the right direction.However, Zurich is far from being a bicycle city.

At the same time, the e-bikes are charged there.Anyone who loosens a bike from the holder pays no raps in the first 30 minutes.From the 31st minute, the loan costs CHF 1,200,000, the city paid for the bicycles and the bike stations;
CHF 100,000 are still planned for the next two years.Cantonal bank and Groupe E will contribute a total of CHF 300,000 over the next five years.

Nevertheless, the two representatives of the administration had to listen to some allegations.The weak point of Basel's bicycle policy is that the boys would no longer bike, said CVP Grand Councilor Helen Schai.And Grand Councilor Jörg Vitelli criticized the priorities in the implementation of bicycle measures.
"You stop where bike paths would be necessary," he said.The Grand Council had never rejected a measure in favor of the cyclists."The need for action is clear in the administration," said the SP politician and presented a CD with photos of weak points in the Basel Velonetz to Martina Münch.

So Burgdorf should get fit / / tomorrow starts for the fifth time “Bike to Work” by Pro Velo.In 2010, 1260 companies registered for the campaign.
Among them is the most bike -friendly city in Switzerland: Burgdorf.Companies, but also municipalities, are busy participating in this year's “Bike to Work” campaign.So also the flagship bike town of Burgdorf.
Susanne Szentkuti is a coordinator for Burgdorf.The GA owner and enthusiastic bike driver works at the building directorate in Burgdorf as a project manager for mobility, energy and environment.For them, “Bike to Work” is an “important instrument of communication and doctorate to raise awareness of the population”.
Burgdorf wanted to go as a committed energy city with a good example and actively work for the promotion of slow traffic.The city administration of Burgdorf announced eleven teams of four drivers this year.There are also six small and seven large companies that have decided to register teams in cooperation with the city for the campaign.
Is the action sustainable?All cyclists have voluntarily undertaken to cover their way to work with the bike for a month.As observations from previous years suggest, many participants already have air outside after one month:
They leave the bike and absorb their old mobility habits again.Szentkuti is still optimistic: «After three implementation,‹ Bike is
To work ›In the community known to many people.»
Year after year, more companies were interested in the campaign.More and more people would be aware of the means of transport.«Individuals even rise.
In the best case, the effect will also spread to leisure traffic. »Many participants are ready to permanently switch to the bike, says Aline Haldemann from Pro Velo, who runs the“ Bike to Work ”project.This shows the evaluation from 2008: "66 percent said that they want to continue to travel with the bike after the campaign." Burgdorf building communities that work for bike travelers are perceived.Especially when really good work is done in the community.
As in Burgdorf: This year the city received a recognition award from Pro Velo for the "particularly convincing" new construction of a two -kilometer long Velohochstrasse along the double -gauge road of the BLS.With the construction, a gap in the Burgdorf slow traffic network was closed.Safe, comfortable and attractive bike compounds have always played an important role in Burgdorf.
The commitment has now been rewarded: Burgdorf was chosen in a survey as the “most bike -friendly bike city in Switzerland”.Szentkuti: «Burgdorf is ready to implement innovative, model -like projects and also invest accordingly.»
The peaceful and respectful coexistence of the various road users, not least thanks to the invention of the meeting zone in Burgdorf, has become a matter of course for almost everyone.This is also reflected in a pleasant traffic climate for cyclists.Burgdorf will not rest on laurels, but will continue to work on the promotion of bike, promises the community employee.
This also means that she herself rises to the bike herself.And not only in June during the "Bike to Work" .bruno Angeli-wider information on the "Bike to Work" project can be found at www.biketowork.ch. "In 2008, 66 percent of the participants said that they were also after the campaignwant to be on the road. »Tips for corporate parking spaces build the infrastructure, more workers switch to bike.Tips for companies: Create bike parking spaces that are directly at the entrance.
These should be covered and illuminated in the evening.The bicycle and footpaths on the company area should be safe.Submit bike cards with recommended access routes to customers and employees.
Showers and wardrobes available.A bike service station with important tools and in particular a pump is also practical.More ideas: Use company bits if possible.
Actions launch - such as a bike patch day, a company excursion with the bike, submission of velovignettes or by Velotrikt with companylogo.bra "Bike to Work" participation every other day: In the "Bike to Work" campaign, employees of a company driveFor a month to at least 50 percent of the working days with the bike to work.Registration for the “Bike to Work” campaign is made by the employer.
They each provide an internal coordinator.In the municipality of+ variant, all companies based in the municipality can participate with up to 50 employees.The teams: The employees usually form teams of four.
Small businesses and branches can also register two or three groups.The way to work: The team members don't have to have the same way to work.You can travel your ways individually.
If you have long commuting paths, you can combine the bike with public transport.The goals of the campaign: “Bike to Work” is another measure of Pro Velo that is to promote cycling - and thus health.The campaign should also be fun and ensure a good atmosphere and exercise in the company.

Velo -Kiosk ensures food / / Eglisau - Eglisauer and visitors to the Rhine town can buy sandwiches and drinks on a mobile kiosk from next week.The municipal council is enthusiastic about the Velo-Kiosk, confirms the deputy municipal clerk, Martin Hermann.
"The vehicle with three wheels has a very special charm," he says.The idea of the bike kiosk comes from Viva Eglisau.However, the operator will be Werner Dubno, owner of the Hirschen inn.
On three wheels, the Velo-Kiosk commutes from the church square to Badi when the weather is nice.The offer includes non -alcoholic drinks, glaces, cakes and sandwiches.The President of Viva Eglisau, Rolf Glaus, is also delighted by the vehicle.
The club worked for around three months what the vehicle should look like.And according to Hermann, the tricycle fits perfectly into the old town.Dubno and the community have already tried to install a kiosk on the Rhine.
But all projects have failed so far.And people were afraid of odor and noise emissions, or the project was too expensive.(db)

Velostadt is just enough / / Ralph Schindelda's construction and traffic department plans various measures to make Basel more attractive for cyclists.The basis forms two surveys.
The bike enjoys great popularity and attention in Basel's politics and population."That is great," said construction and traffic director Hans-Peter Wessels (SP) yesterday at a media conference that followed a tour of the city.Wessels served numerous political advances that are still pending.
"They move in the three -digit range," joked Wessels.His own party, who recently submitted five advances to the Velostadt and also requested a master plan Velo, is compliant.A survey of Pro Velo shows that measures are necessary.
Basel newly reaches grade 4 (2006: 3.7).In the “Veloblatt”, the information organ of Pro Velo of both Basel, this is only considered “scarce”.Traffic climate, security, comfort, network network, storage facilities and importance were requested.
Basel received good grades for the fact that there are few conflicts between bike drivers and pedestrians and that bike oncoming traffic is allowed in many one-way streets, Karin Hopf explains from Pro Velo.The route was given the grade 4.7. However, the storage facilities at SBB station were evaluated, the opportunity to transport the bike by public transport, and the obstacles on the streets.For example, Dolen in the area of the bike was installed in the tram rails.
"These are bicycle traps," complains Hopf.The traffic lights come even worse: "There is no green wave for bike such as in Copenhagen," said Hopf.
The construction site signage is also criticized.This is often geared towards motorized individual traffic.Traffic lights and construction sites each received a grade of 3.3.
Theft, vandalism and snow removal are also an issue among the survey participants.1023 people took part in the passive survey. More transport gardens.It is clear where the work of the administration can start:
The goal of Wessels has declared that Basel from the fifth -placed person should become the most bike -friendly city in Switzerland.Burgdorf is currently still on top ranking with a grade of 4.4.The prerequisites seem to be good.
"Since Basel is circular and has little hill, the paths are short and rather flat," says Wessels.In addition, there is a dense wheel route network, pedestrian zones and the deep level of motorization with 250 private cars on a thousand city dwellers.Another plus is the result of a survey by the GFS research institute on behalf of Pro Velo in the cities of Basel, Bern, Lausanne and Zurich.
Accordingly, the most satisfied cyclists cycle in Basel, and these assess the network of paths positively.49 percent ride a bike here at least twice a week.In order to make the leap to the top, the construction and traffic department will take further measures.
According to Simon Kettner, department head of mobility strategy, there should be one or two additional traffic gardens.«The traffic garden on the Morgarten ring is too far away for people in the Kleinbasel.»In addition, a sub -point and a new edition of the Velostadtplan are in preparation.
The opening of one -way lines for bike ranges should be completed by the end of the year.New parking spaces at SBB station are evaluated.A parking for 1500 bicycles is planned for the Baden train station in the long term.
Further measures concern marketing and a communication strategy for the bike as well as driving courses for children, adolescents and adults. & GT;www.mobilitaet.bsch & gt;www.provelo-beiderbasel.ch

Now the bike in Zurich is also counted / / A new counting technique is intended to provide findings about the habits of cyclists.The city announced by Jürg Rohrer before a week where the traffic has shifted since the opening of the western bypass and the closure of the west tangent.
A network of measurement probes in the lanes gives the traffic department in the police department in detail at any time about the current traffic volume.The city knows much less about bicycle traffic, although the red-green city council constantly emphasizes its importance.Figures about the extent of the bike ride come from either occasional surveys or daily counts.
However, both only result in selective knowledge to which the flaw attached, not to be representative, especially not for other seasons.The civil engineering office wants to fix this knowledge gap.One occasion is the VELO 12 program - a bundle of measures with which the proportion of bicycles in total traffic is to be increased from 7 to 12 percent in 2012.
The order was to set up permanent, automatic velo counting points.However, this turned out to be difficult because most of the bike counters used at home and abroad are only suitable for cycle paths, while in Zurich the bicycles mostly have to share the roads by cars and buses.Inaccuracy of 5 percentages
In the end, products were questioned, which, in cooperation with a private planning office, were tested at two locations in Unterstrass for six months.One counted with a radar, the other with a so -called induction loop.The loop proved to be more reliable, which is why it is now being used.
The wire cutting is placed four to five centimeters deep in the topped streets and covered again with asphalt.The wire welcomes an electromagnetic impulse from the bicycles if they are made of metal.This is forwarded to a weatherproof counting and transmission box that is located on the side of the road and the data is transmitted to a central computer every evening.
The system is programmed so that it does not cover cars and töffs.However, bicycles that come in the crowd are bicycled.The inaccuracy is around five percent.
The civil engineering office wants to set up ten counting points, as it writes in its latest “mobility news”.They should not only cover different areas, but also different types of paths (Veloweg, main axis, district road) and various driving purposes (commuting, leisure).The following counting points are already in operation:
Lux-Guyer-Weg (Letten) Bertastrasse (Wiedikon) Limmatuferweg (right bank) Mythenquai (Hafen Enge).
The course of the summer is added: Mühlebachstrasse (Seefeld) underpass Langstrassecheuchzerstrasse (district 6) Hofwiesenstrasse (Unterstrass) Andreasstrasse (Oerlikon) Binzmühlestrasse (Affoltern).the parallel to the waterworks road above the Letten Canal runs.The measurements showed that bicycle traffic has tripled over 1200 bicycles every day between January and April.23,000 cyclists used this path throughout April, with less bicycles counting on weekends and out of the city.

What is discussed on Baz.ch / / cyclist want to announce criticism of the car traffic with a bike demonstration (BAZ from yesterday).Many BAZ.CH readers don't think of this campaign.
I understand no comparison with Genfdass in Geneva and such demos in the states.But comparing these cities with Basel and its bike rides, it seems to me.Geneva and bicycles are two different pairs of boots.
We have an absolute bike paradise in Basel!It is the bicycles who make a hell out of it!Pierre A. Note Sobol traffic rules
Then, dear bicycles and fanatics, make your move, but please remember: the red light is stopped, in front of the pedestrian strip and the light as well and in the event of a stop signal.Stefan Degenigenatige back -layer is said to have been the other who behaves next to it.

More possibilities for Velos / / Urs Ristauf Einbahnstrasse in various quarters are newly approved by bicycles and mopeds in oncoming traffic.A recourse blocks this opening in Hammerstrasse.
At the beginning of August, the Greifengasse was opened for Velos in oncoming traffic, whereas the BVB had failed unsuccessfully because several tram and bus lines run there (the BAZ reported).Now the construction and traffic department has published a number of ten streets that are previously signaled as one-way lines and are now open to bike and- with one exception- also for moped in oncoming traffic.In this respect, they are unproblematic in that none of these streets runs a public transport and they usually have no large pedestrian frequencies.
The streets are published in today's cantonal sheet and specified on the map (right).Financed recurs are possible within ten days that have suspensive effect.Of the ten affected streets, eight are in the Grossbasel in the St. Alban, Bruderholz, Bachletten, Iselin and suburbs (after official statistical structure).
Two other streets are located in the Kleinbasler Claraquartier.The Claragraben is to be opened in two sections from the wirezuGstrasse to the Sperrstrasse towards Sperrstrasse.Because the Office for Mobility counts such sections, 15 new routes occur.
According to Martin Weibel, Head of Traffic Technology at the Office for Mobility, their implementation costs around CHF 100,000 that are burdened with the bike frame loan.
The 15 sections form a relatively small increase compared to the existing 456 pieces of street that are already open to bike conversion.According to a message, they are based on the bicycle promotion strategy of the construction and traffic department as well as on suggestions from the association Pro Velo.However, the sections of the road must meet a comprehensive catalog of criteria that was created together with the cantonal police.
Weibel calls the road width in the first place.For narrow streets, alternative points are also required at which you can cross, for example because the parking spaces are interrupted.The narrow routes should not be longer than fifty meters.
In the case of winding streets and such with gradients, the visibility must be particularly observed.Open wishes.Not all wishes were fulfilled with the new list, as the view of the advances of recent years shows.
This was what Mirjam Ballmer (green alliance) called three suggestions in a suit from 2009.For the Hammerstrasse mentioned there, oncoming traffic was published in the Feldberg- to Clarastrasse section several years ago, but there is still an appeal to the administrative court, says Weibel.There are exams for Eisengasse as part of the downtown traffic regime, which the government council decides, but the opening for bicycles is demanding because of the bus lines.
The oncoming traffic in St. Johanns suburb is not feasible because of its narrow.According to Weibel, a light signal system must be adjusted in Solothurnerstrasse, which was mentioned in another initiative, which is intended as part of a renovation in 2011.Velogegenverkehr is also planned on Müllheimerstrasse as soon as the signaling system on the Feldbergstrasse junction is renewed.

Paradise for bike thieves / / Only in the German Münster are more bike stolen than in Bern.This is the result of an internet ranking.
Doubtful honor: Bern mixes at the forefront in a comparison with other cities in German -speaking Europe.Unfortunately only in the statistics of the bike thief.The ranking comes from the internet portal www.geld.de - a provider of liability insurance.
60 police directorates of the largest cities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland have been requested, writes in a media release.Over 400,000 bicycles were stolen in these three countries in 2009.In the city of Bern, 2378 Velos illegally changed the owner.
In this way, the Swiss capital is second to the population of the clauses.Only in the “architecturally neatly clean -up north German student town in Münster” (money.de) were more bicycles stolen (see table). The cantonal police Bern confirms the figures of the cleveranking on request."Two to three notes for bicycle thiefs dail," says police spokesman Franz Märki.
Consideration at statistics for Claudio Enggist, Vice President of Pro Velo Bern, is to be enjoyed with caution: «It is not related to the number of bicycles that are in traffic in the respective cities.»
It hardly surprises him that Münster leads the statistics."This is number one in Germany." According to Claudio Enggist, a relatively large number of people are also traveling with the bike in Bern."In order for the claw numbers to decrease, the public bike parking spaces with ironing would have to be upgraded to chains." Thieves are hardly difficult to cut off the city of Bern in the reconnaissance rate of bicycle steels.
According to money.de, this is 1.2 percent.Police spokesman Märki, on the other hand, keeps: «This number only includes the cases in which the perpetrators were caught.»In 2009, the police effectively collected 1,500 bicycles.
«At 237 we found the owner.»This corresponds to a quota of 10 percent.Tobias Habeggerdie table

In Basel and Bern, more bicycles are stolen than in Zurich / / in Zurich, 2454 Velos were lost due to theft last year.This lies the largest Swiss city in the European midfield.
By Benno Gasserzurich - every three and a half hours a bike strikes in the city of Zurich.The thefts are practically never explained.The police solved only 2.1 percent of cases.
With this clearance rate, Zurich is very far back in an international comparison.According to a study by the information platform, only Basel cuts worse with a rate of 0.9 percent.In Erlangen, almost every fourth bike love is informed.
The German city is in second place.At the top is Wuppertal, which, however, counts all two -wheelers and thus moped and motorcycles.Zurich is located in the midfielder online portal last year's number of Velodief steels from 60 cities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Measured on the population, Zurich with 2454 thefts is in 24th place. However, the number of unreported cases is a lot higher.In this assessment, the German small town of Münster occupies the top position.
In no other place are bike thieves more active.The bottom is Stuttgart here.At first glance, it is astonishing that the Bern, which is considered to be a peaceful, is in second place and thus far before Zurich.
Basel follows directly on Bern.Both cities hardly differ from Zurich in the total number of thefts, but have much fewer residents.This explains the top positions in the negative ranking.
Marco Cortesi, media chief of the Zurich City Police, explains the low educational rate, among other things, with the difficulty of finding the right -wing owners.This was even easier with the earlier bike numbers.If an owner wants to pick up his vehicle from the police, there are further problems:
Many owners do not know the frame number or brand of their bike.In addition, the police resources of the police in bike thiefs are limited.Most bikes would be stolen for use if, for example, someone missed the tram or bus, says Cortesi.
Vel search in the internet this Velos, which were only stolen to quickly drive from A to B, most of the time on streets and squares.Disposal and recycling Zurich (ore) collect these vehicles.This also includes models disposed of by owners.
But beforehand, ore employees mark the two-wheelers.If the marking is still available after one month, the bike is considered to be abandoned and is taken.Two wheels that have been completed, but could hinder emergency vehicles, are immediately removed.
In this way, the ore collected 2800 Velos last year.92 percent of them are no longer picked up.Part of it is prepared and auctioned.

The cantonal council wants to promote bicycle traffic for bicycles / / with CHF 20 million.The SVP is against it.
By Liliane Minorzürich - the Zurich cycle path network is around 1700 kilometers long.1700 kilometers, which are apparently little known to a large part of the population.In any case, this is the conclusion of a study on bicycle traffic in the canton of Zurich.
The bike has a share of only 6 percent in the overall traffic.Now that should change: cycling is promoted with a ten -year program.
The cantonal council approved the necessary CHF 20 million yesterday with 114 against 50 votes.Among other things, the 20 million are to be issued for the following goals: bicycle department: Two million francs should flow into a specialist office whose task will be to support communities in cycle path construction.Communication: More than seven million francs cost measures that, among other things, are to be better known to the cycle path network.
In addition, the canton of bicycle courses wants to promote and sensitize the communities to the concerns of the cyclists.Velo and public transport: Five million are intended for better bicycle places for knot points of public transport.
The government first wants to develop a concept.Exemplary administration: Five million francs are invested in bike parking spaces, cloakrooms and showers in buildings of the cantonal administration.The funding program met with great praise for almost all factions.
"This is the best template from Rita Fuhrer's tenure," said Martin Geilinger (Greens, Winterthur).This finally gives the bike promotion a tailwind.Willy Germann (CVP, Winterthur) said that a big impact was achieved here with little money.
Above all, two points in the council met with a lot of approval: the efforts for more bike spaces at train stations and the bike station.Many cycle paths are unusable for everyday life, said part-time velokurier Roland Munz (SP, Zurich).
"Here the specialist office can help to find comprehensive solutions." SVP against its government councilor for the FDP was also a question of loyal to the loan.Because originally a somewhat differently designed funding program was intended as a counter -proposal to the popular initiative for more bicycle traffic.However, because the initiators erroneously withdrawn their desire too early, the counter -proposal became obsolete.
The government council decided to work on a funding program itself."Now we are in the word for the initiators," said Gabriela Winkler (Oberglatt). For the SVP, none of this was an argument.The faction was the only one, but with half a dozen votes against the loan.
A funding program was unnecessary, found Lorenz Habicher (Zurich): «The bike has a sufficiently strong position."Cycling is a minority program, said Werner Bosshard (Rümlang), even an enthusiastic leisure" Gümmeler ".
Therefore, the economic benefit of the funding program is low.John Appenzeller (Stallikon) finally ruled that the program was a pure money destruction machine: "Some of the bike paths are not used." In contrast, SVP government council and economics director Ernst Stocker did not arrive, which emphasized the importance of bike promotion with the following words: "Those who drive bike make space on the street.

The bicycle is to become a full -fledged means of transport / / The canton of Zurich will use a total of CHF 20 million beyond the construction of bike paths in the next 10 years to make bike more popular.The parliament accepted the program with 114 to 50 votes.
· A recovered popular initiative has never had so much effect, the critics from the SVP were amazed.Because an initiative of Pro Velo submitted at the end of 2007 demanded the fixed increase in bicycle traffic by 15 percent, the cantonal council had rejected it.Since the request was hardly contested in principle, he commissioned the government to work out a counter -proposal.
Before he was available, the initiators withdrew their request - too early.The order was now formally obsolete, but the government worked out an application about which the cantonal council decided on Monday.For SVP funding
Unnecessary bird funding program consists of a framework loan of CHF 20 million for 10 years.The money is explicitly not intended for the construction of bike paths, for which around CHF 15 million in the budget are provided for in the case of a referendum from 1986.Rather, the bicycle promotion program is intended to move people to use the cycle path network more.
This includes various information campaigns, the support of the municipalities, the improvement of the parking facilities for bicycles on cantonal facilities and at stops of public transport as well as more information about the route network, including a bicycle card on the Internet.In the cantonal office for traffic, a coordination point for bicycle traffic is created.As the only faction, the SVP rejected the template as an unnecessary desired catalog.
Lorenz Habicher (SVP., Zurich) explained that bicycle traffic has such a strong position today that further funding is not necessary, explained Lorenz Habicher (SVP.He criticized that the government had acted without an order.Other SVP representatives took the opportunity to complain about cyclists who do not adhere to the street law.
The money for the program comes from the street fund, so come from motorized private transport, John Appenzeller (SVP., Stallikon) pointed out.Werner Bosshard (SVP., Rümlang) said that bicycle traffic was only for a minority, of which a part in turn has the feeling that he is part of the better part of humanity.Stocker behind the program bike is by no means a minority program, but sensible because the square on the street is becoming increasingly scarce, Bosshard was replied.
In contrast to the SVP, “Ernst takes the bike promotion seriously,” said Martin Geilinger (Gp., Winterthur) with reference to Erican Director Ernst Stocker.Marcel Burlet (Sp., Regensdorf) was happy about the change of the government and was annoyed by the SVP's attitude.An information offensive for the bike is necessary, even if not all parts of the program correspond to what he had imagined, said Benno Scherrer (GLP., Uster). The FDP felt responsible for the former initiators:
"It would be a violation of loyalty and faith to leave them in the rain," said Gabriela Winkler (FDP., Oberglatt).Government Councilor Ernst Stocker emphasized that the measures needed for CHF 2 million a year.The government is therefore close to the pulse of the population.
He was impressed by a visit to Rotterdam, where a lot of bike was driven."In addition, electrovelo's people who - like me - are not so sporty, open access to this means of transport," said Stocker.In the end, the Council voted against the application of the SVP with 111 to 50 votes for the template and approved the framework loan with 114 to 50 votes for 2 abstentions.
The quorum of 90 votes, which was necessary to overcome the brake, was significantly exceeded.The Council enables money for cycle path construction to deprive a postulate of the SP in 2006.
This wanted to raise the annual amount for the expansion of the cycle path network to CHF 20 million.However, the government council was able to demonstrate that cycle paths are mostly planned together with road expansion and that it is not easy to exploit the annual amount.That is why the SP agreed to the depreciation.

Where bicycles have to brake / / Fabian Baumannim General is Basel a bicycle -friendly city.The Veloweg network is tight, most drivers are tolerant and the traffic climate is pleasant.
No wonder that Basel also regularly receives better grades in the surveys that the Association Pro Velo carries under Swiss bicycles than Geneva, Bern or Zurich.And because as a bike driver you don't lose time with parking space searches, you drive through the city as rapidly in Basel on two wheels as with hardly any other means of transport.However, there are also places where the otherwise fast cyclists are slowed down.
Such a place is the bicycle ramp at the intersection in front of the Pauluskirche.Anyone who has ever wanted to cycle from Oberwilerstrasse via the stone ring can sing a song about it: the traffic light just doesn't want to switch to green.
While the others sometimes switch from green to red and back several times, bike drivers have to wait for minutes in front of the red light and watch the passing cars and trams.In the event of a non -representative measurement, the traffic light has never been red (with a green phase of ten seconds), but this waiting time can become a perceived eternity for cold and wind.And in view of the busy streets, it is not advisable to simply disregard the traffic lights.

Free travel for bicycles / / Today in Zurich all Tempo 30 zones stop at the edge of the city center.Now the city council is presenting a new traffic concept.
The center is scheduled to be more pedestrous in the next 15 years, and Velos have free travel.Christina Neuhauswahrend The Zurich outdoor quarters in recent years have been calmed down with Tempo 30 zones in recent years, the downtown generally applies to speed 50. The Tempo 30 zones all stop at the CityRand.
Now the city council has adopted the "Traffic Concept of Downtown - upgrading the city rooms".It shows the means by which the city center should be increasingly adapted to the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in the time frame of 15 years.The new concept is a guide and is intended to serve urban planners as a binding guideline.
Trees and Tempo 30 The political mandate to upgrade the city center through new pedestrian zones has existed since the nineties.The number of public car parking spaces has been regulated by the so -called “historical compromise” since 1996:
He stipulates that new underground garage places are compensated for by lifting street parking spaces.In the traffic concept presented on Wednesday, which refers to the city center and the development area of Europaallee at the main train station, the city council anchor its previous transport policy.The paper essentially says that the city center is built even more to the needs of pedestrians and the cyclist.
In this respect, there are restrictions on motorized traffic in that more encounter zones at 20 speed and that the Tempo 30 zones are also extended to the city center.Today, for example, speed is still 50 on Bahnhofstrasse. The main streets remain at 50 km / h.
Nothing changes in the number of inner -city parking spaces either.Currently, “Visitor and customer-oriented parking spaces” are counted in City Circle 1 and in the so-called City-close areas, which is 149 more than in 1990.After the opening of the new Opéra car park, various street parking spaces are lifted there and compensated for in the new parking.
According to the traffic planner Erich Willi, the road space is then redesigned by the municipal civil engineering office and signposted at speed 30.Another example is Zähringerplatz.Here, too, no cars will soon be parked.
According to the historical compromise, the lifting of the street parking spaces is only possible if the parking garages Urania or Central are expanded.According to Willi, the Central project has turned out to be largely unrealized.The city council decides on the possible expansion of the Urania car park by 200 to 250 parking spaces.
Velos in pedestrian zone a big change brings the concept for cyclists.If the recommendations of the strategy paper are implemented, all streets in the city center should soon be allowed to be used in both directions.
The driving ban today for bicycles in pedestrian zones is to be lifted wherever possible.According to Erich Willi, exceptions are already being made today.The basic driving ban can be lifted for residents, for example.
One now wants to reverse the principle of driving bikes for bicycles: where it is not explicitly prohibited, Velos should be allowed to mix under the pedestrians at step.The implementation should be gradually carried out as part of the upcoming renovations.
The main urban axes are now to be supplemented with continuous wheel strips, so that a seamless network of cycling routes is created through the city center of Zurich.In addition, there should be sufficient bicycle spaces, especially near train stations and shopping centers.In the city center of Zurich - the picture shows the Rämistrasse - cyclists receive a complete cycling network, and in the future they no longer have to rise from bike in the pedestrian zones.

Velos come to the pedestrian zone / / The city wants to open the pedestrian zones for bicycles.The pedestrians continue to advance there, but the specialist association of pedestrians is still against it.
By Jürg Rohrerzürich- Foot and Veloparadies Zurich-City- With this goal, the city council has decided on a new traffic concept for the city center (TA from Thursday).New Tempo 30 zones are planned in the narrow and inside Seefeld, a meeting zone in southern Löwenstrasse, where pedestrians have progressed and applies to cars 20, as well as new pedestrian zones in the Jelmoli and Münsterhof area.Nothing changes on the main streets, there is still pace there
50th parts of the old town of Zurich are already pedestrian zones in which cars can only run on the few signaled routes with a special permit and bike.The city wants to basically open the pedestrian zones for bicycles and go on intercourse.There should still be driving bans in dangerous places, but they are specially signaled.
Today it is exactly the opposite: permission to the bike routes is specially displayed.A survey by Tagesanzeiger.ch with 642 answers has shown that 48 percent welcomes the opening, while 52 percent reject.
The opening is also rejected by Thomas Schweizer, Managing Director of Foot Transport Switzerland, the specialist association of pedestrians.He fears that the bike travelers in these mixed zones are on the road too quickly and that pedestrians are the victims.Velor routes through the pedestrian zones think Swiss is right that today's situation is practical.
But he thinks bike in every alley is wrong. "No conflicts" understand the city's bike officer that the foot goers becomes anxiety and anxious fear of the announced opening of their zone?"Only to a limited extent," replies Urs Walter from the civil engineering office.
«We already have several places where the pedestrian zones are open to bike today: Rennweg, Kuttelgasse, Kirchgasse.I am not aware that there are regular conflicts.There are also comparable situations in Stadelhoferstrasse or in the Quaian layers that have been working for a long time.»
Walter emphasizes that the planned opening is not an invention of the city of Zurich, but that there are such zones all over Switzerland, for example in Winterthur, Stein am Rhein or Chur.In addition, it is an order from the regional structure plan from 2000, which provides that the pedestrian areas are also permeable to bicycle travelers.Self -control
In demand for motivating or forcing the bicycle to motivate or forced the bicycle.The surfaces of the alleys remain as they are.But who ensures that only walking pace is really driven, especially since this pace is not precisely defined anyway?
The VeloFunetrie: «We basically assume that the bicycle travelers will stick to the regulations.The situations are usually the case that the bicycles drive on their own at an adapted pace.If there are still grievances, it must be reacted to this, for example with public actions or controls.
A culture of coexistence is necessary in the city center.This is what the new traffic concept stands for. »Where it could be dangerous, the new traffic concept provides for bans.The steep strict yard is also possible for this, and the bike ban will remain on the Bahnhofstrasse, because there are already delicacies with the many people and the trams.
It is still open when the city will open the existing pedestrian zones or set up a new zone with passage for bike.There is no schedule for the new traffic concept inner city, only a time horizon: 10 to 15 years.Legal reasons are expected to be that it will still take:
The civil engineering office assumes that the opening of the pedestrian zones must be advertised because it is a new signaling.And then objections can be expected.The «death kick»
The SVP called for the fight against the new traffic concept “With all might” yesterday.For them, the city council aims to push motorized private transport out of the city in 15 years, which would mean “death“ for the urban business.Pro Velo Zurich, on the other hand, speaks of a "quantum leap". On the Limmatquai it has enough space for wheels and feet.

Safe drive to the Staffelegg for Radler / / Franziska Laurdas
Obere Fricktal still has some catching up to do with regard to the range of cycling routes.But the canton is working on improving the bike route network.Anyone who currently wants to use the Velo via the Staffelegg or Benken from the Fricktal is poorly served.
There is no dense traffic on the curvy main roads in the middle of the most beautiful jurally landscapes, but if a car comes, it usually broke up at an impressive pace.And there is still no bike path or at least a bike strip.This will change soon.
The canton presented the construction projects for 2011 yesterday: Eight million francs were set for the further expansion of the cantonal cycling route network."This is a very important investment," says Daniel Schaffner, managing director of the Aargau Jura park.
«I know from my own experience that the routes over Staffelegg and Benken are extremely dangerous for cyclists.»This year you want to promote the bike routes and link with existing offers."A project is for families - it is called Pedalito and is connected to an existing attraction," reveals the coarse concept. "This year, the covering of the covering is ended at the northern pass height of the Staffelegg," says cantonal engineer Rolf Meier.
In the investment volume of around CHF four million, the covering and widening of the street are included.A bike strip is attached in the upper narrower part.However, the Benken, however, remains without a bicycle path.
Otherwise, only four of the 24 new construction projects are closed to the Fricktal.In Frick and Kaiseraugst, a roundabout is being realized, in Magden the third stage of the expansion of the main street is taken by the hand, the cantonal road is renovated in Mumpf and a pedestrian crossing is realized.However, a relief for the feeders should be the renovation of the node in stone at the locations of Novartis and Syngenta.
So far, their employees had trouble getting from the main road towards the access of the two industrial areas.In total, the canton of Aargau spent around CHF 158 million in the current year for the construction and maintenance of the transport infrastructure.In 2011, a total of around CHF 110 million for 90 current and 24 new projects in the field of cantonal streets will be used in the 2011 construction program.

Pedestrians as a free game / / The article “Free trip for bike” (NZZ 13. 11. 11) I can see that, according to the new traffic concept of the Zurich city council Velos, free travel should have free travel in the pedestrian zones in the future.This is a terrifying perspective for us pedestrians.
Even today, bikers consider us a freeway on footpaths, sidewalk, pedestrian strips and in pedestrian zones.Again and again you are frightened by hair -sharp biking drivers, often you have to save yourself with a rapid dodging from being overturned.It is particularly critical when you are traveling with children.
These should actually be able to move freely in places that are reserved for the pedestrians and are hardly prepared for cyclists.You always hear from pedestrians who are driven around by bike drivers - often with fatal consequences.I very much hope that the last word is not yet spoken in terms of this part of the traffic concept.
Hans Jörg Wehrli, Zurichlaut the Zurich city council is said to be the center of Zurich more "pedestrian -friendly", and Velos should have "free travel".Consistent cycling routes make sense.
This concept serves for traffic safety.It is incomprehensible that the idea is thwarted insofar as Velos should now also be allowed in pedestrian zones.The hint that bicycles should mix under the pedestrians at a walking pace is completely foreign to the world.

Bernese bicycle lobby wants to change fast routes for Velos / / Region Bern Commissioner to the bike.
In order to achieve this goal, Pro Velo Bern calls for a dense network of bicycle routes.They have long been part of the cityscape in the Copenhagen or Amsterdam.There the so -called bicycle routes or bicycles are used lively:
In Copenhagen, 37 percent of commuter paths were covered on the bike last year.Up to 2015, half of all commuters are said to be traveling with the bike in the Danish capital.The cyclists from A to B.
While the expansion of the route network for Velopendler is already being tackled in Denmark and Holland, planning is still in its infancy in this country.The Interest Association Pro Velo has now launched the idea of a regional bike ray network.It provides for fast routes within a radius of 10 to 15 kilometers around the center of the city of Bern.
Existing routes are to be expanded and new ones are to be realized.For the implementation, per bike assumes a time frame of ten to twenty years.How important it could be that commuters switch from car and public transport to bike, show forecasts of the regional conference:

Northern Europe cycles, Bern wants to catch up / / Velo -Transportwas in the Bern region, is already everyday life in the north of Europe: Rapid routes for Velopendler are an alternative to car and public traffic in the Velovora states Denmark and Holland.They are called "Snelfietsroute" in the Netherlands or "Cykel Commissioner Ruter" in Denmark.
Rapid routes for bike enders are used lively in Northern European cities and agglomerations.In Copenhagen, 37 percent of commuters were covered on the bike last year.In 2015, half of all commuters are said to be on the bike, according to the ambitious destination in the Danish capital.
The north is already tackling the expansion of the route network for Velopendler in Denmark and Holland, the planning is still in its infancy in this country.Last week the Interest Association Pro Velo has the idea of a regional bicycle rail network
Lancen. "Such a bike ray network could also become a real alternative to commuting with car or public transport in Swiss agglomerations," says Ursula Lehner-Lierz, expert in Veloverkehr.She has been working as a bicycle advisor for over twenty years and knows the situation in the Netherlands in particular."Of course you are much further there than with us, because the bicycle has been accepted as an equal means of transport for a long time." Green wave for bicycle demonstration then looks like this in Copenhagen, for example:
On the Nørrebrogade, a main traffic axis, bike enders have a green wave during the shock times in the morning and evening.30,000 cyclists travel this route every day and, thanks to the green wave, much faster.The traffic lights are set so that the 2.5 km long route between the Nørrebro district and the center can be covered in just 7½ minutes.
If you drive at 20 kilometers per hour, you never have to stop on a red light.The speed is "quick", but children could also keep up well, it says on the official website of the city of Copenhagen.The “world's best bicycle city” (self -promotion) offers 390 kilometers of bike strips.
The first velo «highways» from the city to the suburbs will be opened at the end of the year.They lead around 15 kilometers from the center to agglomeration.A 20-kilometer long bicycle “highway” is to be put into operation in 2012.
Velo is driven in Copenhagen all year round."The bicycle strips are also freed from ice and snow in the deepest winter and full of bicycle," Lehner-Lierz describes a visit. "Fiets Filevrij"-Velos Staufrereich in the Netherlands is done a lot for the cyclists.
For example, the national action program “Fiets Filevrij!“What means as much as“ Fahr Staufrei Velo!».The national parliament spoke a loan for the expansion or new construction of 16 quick bike routes across the country.
A total of around 80 million euros would now be available for “Fiets Filevrij”, the expert at the Pro Velo Bern assembly said."Wow," sighed one in the audience.Financing for such bike projects is one hurdle.
The other is the cooperation between the affected communities.«So far, breeding policy has been operated within administrative limits.If you want to build a sensible quick route network, you have to plan regionally.
»In the large area of Copenhagen, 15 municipalities have adopted a 44 million budget for 13 commuter routes.
Velobahns make sense where many people commuted, says Lehner-Lierz.In addition, there must be the incentive to switch to bike.Veloskllenell routes along the stammer -safe motorways or train lines with crowded trains could be such an incentive.
Mirjam Messerlischnell routes for Velopendler motorways for cars, Velobahn for Velos more than just a bicycle path a bicycle path and a bicycle path are not the same.A bicycle tray is most comparable to a highway.
Cyclists should also be able to reach Belo drivers from A to B quickly and without interruptions through traffic lights or intersections.Like the highways, the bicycles form an actual network in the long term.The goal: commuters who are traveling by car or public transport for routes between 7 and 15 kilometers today switch to bike or the electrobics.
"With an e-bike, it is easy to commute on a quick route to commute larger distances," says Ursula Lehner-Lierz, expert in bicycle traffic and bicycle policy.The booming of comfortable electrobics could help to switch automotiveists to the bike."However, autopenders are used to a certain comfort and also expect it on bike routes," says the expert.
Certain criteria have to meet bicycles.They have to be wide enough so that bikers can overtake others, the road surface must not offer too much resistance, the signaling must be so clear that even local -radio -free recognition quickly recognizes where the route carries out.The bicycle train has to be well illuminated and ice and snow-free in winter.
In Velo prefabricated countries such as Denmark or Holland you can already go one step further.Along by Velobahnen there are service stations, at the destinations there are enough safe parking opportunities for the two-wheelers and shower and locker options for the commuter.Got. ”From Belp to Bern there would already be a bike route without detours and according to the criteria of a bicycle tray, you could create the route in less than 20 minutes.»
That was just one of many examples that were mentioned at the Pro Velo Bern meeting last week.Velobahn, as they already exist in Northern Europe, are also said to be used by commuters in the Bern region.How important it could be that they switch from car and public transport to bike, show forecasts of the regional conference:
In the Bern region by 2030, these assume an increase in private transport by 25 percent and 60 percent.Pro Velo has the demand for quick routes and a possible network plan for the regional traffic conference.Veloschnell routes could be led on separate route and stripes along main traffic axes, said Stefan Jordi, President of Pro Velo Bern.
However, the connections should be designed in such a way that bikes had to stop on a distance of 5 kilometers a maximum of three times.The network outlined by Pro Velo provides for fast routes within a radius of 10 to 15 kilometers around the center of the city of Bern.Existing routes are to be expanded and new ones are to be realized.
He assumes a time frame of ten to twenty years, said Jordi at the meeting."It shouldn't take that long," says a votant's opinion.Specific projects would have to be entered this year, they wanted to receive federal funds for the implementation.
Unfortunately, reality often looks different in the implementation of bike projects, replied Jordi, thereby spoke the project of a direct bike connection from the Bernese Breitenrain into Länggasse.Write to us your opinion on the idea of the velobahnedaktion@bernerzeitung.chzum Example Copenhagen: On main traffic axes in the city, traffic lights for cyclists are put on green.

Use for the weakest road users / / Spiezvon Five objections were partially successful in 2010 by Pro Velo Spiez.Their implementation benefits the weakest road users.
A year ago, Pro Velo Spiez should have died.The rescue was worth it (we reported).When converting the station, including the road renovation, the BLS, as the client, observes suggestions for speed reduction in critical areas and the design of the bicycle parking spaces.
In the case of a planned new building on Hondrichstrasse, the view is improved as well as possible.Entering without a Chanceim Geminance procedure for the local planning revision proposes the development of further residential buildings on Oberland- and Simmentalstrasse from access roads instead of cantonal roads.
The precautionary objection to the Schluckhal biomass center had no chance to improve the traffic and to fall below the road distance when building a new building on Bahnhofstrasse.Gerhard Schafroth suggested activities in the current year at the Annual General Meeting: Promotion of Velo driving and security.
The first to protect the environment, for your own health and construction, as well as to relieve traffic.The increasing accidents with two -wheelers call for better traffic conditions, but also for suitable equipment and compliance with the traffic rules.Older returners are worried with e-bikes.
The association is dependent on further members for implementation.The national “Velojournal”, which appears five times a year, also contains the annual fee of CHF 30 for individual members and CHF 40 for families.A visit to a bicycle factory, a bicycle museum and participation in market starts in Spiez are further intended activities.

On the footpath it becomes close / / / Kurt Tchandia
Dornach wants to make footpaths accessible to the bikers.The canton of Baselland is also likely to set the course in slow traffic.The Dornach municipal councilor Thomas Gschwind not only likes to drive bikes.
He is also an advocate of an economic handling of the existing traffic infrastructure.The head of the local youth center can therefore imagine that pedestrians and cyclists use the same paths in Dornach.Where it makes sense, footpaths should be opened for cyclists, he suggested in the local council.
His proposal visibly surprised the council colleagues.Ultimately, however, the Gschwind's council took up.As part of an analysis, the municipality wants to pay particular attention to slow traffic and any synergies between pedestrians and cyclists.
Gschwind's flash of inspiration seems to save a template that would otherwise have earned the predicate tubular crepe.In fact, from the laudable intentions of the Dornacher municipal council, in cooperation with the transport commission and the specialized transport office Metron, a weakness analysis on Dornach's streets and to carry out because of the way is not much left.According to the canton of Solothurn, the majority of the proposed measures cannot be enforced.
Above all, the subjective feeling of pedestrians, more pedestrian strips would create more security, does not withstand a closer look.Mayor Kurt Henzi: "Most traffic accidents pass on pedestrian strips that are incorrectly set." In addition to the free voters, the SP also wants to consistently promote slow traffic, the interaction of footmakers and bicycle drivers should now be coordinated more finely.This includes, for example, new bike strips on Weidenstrasse or the introduction of oncoming traffic for bike in Josefengasse.
In contrast, cyclists could soon run on the lower Brühlweg.Potential.According to Gschwind, bicycles in Dornach regularly move in a legal gray area when they avoid more dangerous streets and switch to footpaths.
This condition could be removed with an opening of certain footpaths.Corresponding signals are already available in the neighboring community of Aesch.Doris Capaul, head of the foot and hiking trails in the canton of Baselland, confirms this.
As an example of a combined foot and Veloweg, she describes her daily way to work between Frenkendorf and Liestal.Capaul sees potential for an opening, especially where footpaths are little used.But every case or every section of the path must be viewed individually.
The basics have developed Pro Velo Switzerland and the specialist association of pedestrians in a 50-page paper.The starting point for combined use is always a well -founded clarification.In principle, continuous bike routes would have to be led around pedestrian areas if possible.
At crossing points or places, where a common path is considered sensible, the risk potential would have to be analyzed and reduced.Little accidents.It makes no sense if the merging of pedestrians and cyclists result in alternative and stop maneuvers.
At the same time, signal boards must be made aware of bicycle traffic.The statistics, according to Pro Velo and Foot traffic Switzerland, show that accidents rarely happened on shared because of accidents.However, conflicts often arose.
Visually impaired and older people are affected in advance.In general, pedestrians are more likely to be true and felt faster in their freedom of movement, while bike drivers described the conflicts as light and tend to be unproblematic.Trottoir may be used.
The signal “Feussweg with additional board” has had legal force for 13 years.The Swiss signaling ordinance stipulates that the signal can be attached to relatively strongly busy roads at the beginning of a weakly committed sidewalk.The sidewalk may then be used by bicycles and motor bikes with a turned engine.
An interaction occurs: the larger the load on the street, the more cyclists switch to the sidewalk.The higher the pedestrian frequency on the sidewalk, the more cyclists avoid using the sidewalk.

In Geneva, the RiScha is a Velo / / The Federal Office, which RiSchas in Zurich does not allow as a bike, supports the Prix Velo.Nominated for this: a Geneva RiScha operation.
Zurich - he was stunned when he read the tender folder for the Prix Velo, says Pascal Nydegger, Managing Director of Rikscha Taxi.It lists a company that wants to offer a service for “thematic walks” for tourists in Geneva.With the exactly the same vehicles that stand in Nydeggers garages in Zurich, Bern and Basel.
His company wanted to put a similar rickshaw service for tourists in Zurich in mid-April and other cities.For the time being, nothing has become of it, since the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra) does not see any way to allow the pedal -operated triple places with electrical pedal support as bicycles.So that office, and therefore Nydegger's outrage, which as a partner, supports the Prix Velo as a partner.

Thanks to bike registers / / theft estimates, in Switzerland, up to 100,000 stolen bicycles are assumed every year.The bike community agrees that something should finally be done about it.
The registration system from Peter Kolb from Basel already offers one possibility.To counteract the hinge with the help of a registration system will probably become a matter of private providers.
So far, neither the state nor the bicycle industry has thought anything of a central bicycle register.Andreas Gubler, President of Velosuisse, says the association in which the most important bicycle importers and manufacturers are merged: «Registration systems bring great administrative effort and are associated with costs.And costs are always synonymous with reduction in attractiveness, i.e. driving cycling becomes more unattractive.»
The bike manufacturers and the importers are currently not ready to equip bicycles with microchips.Appropriate tests were carried out years ago."The chip installation increases production, the additional costs would have to be passed on to consumers," said Gubler.
Velodieben The forehead bidding pressure does not seem to be great enough in the bike industry to profile yourself with a registration solution.At this point the company Veloregister.ch from Peter Kolb comes into play.Kolb, who takes care of the two-wheeler collection point at the Basel-Stadt police, wants to fill a gap with his online platform for stolen bicycles founded in 2009.
Cycling owners can register their bike for a one -time fee of CHF 13.You will receive a badge with the registration number in the form of an adhesive and a bicycle with the most important data.You can also upload up to four photos of your bike.
"Thieves have a hard time to get stolen bicycles from which photos exist," said Kolb.He also wants to sensitize the population to the problem of bike theft.«The advantage is that every bike has access to the stolen wheels and can notify the owner if a bike is found.
We start, »says the policeman.The practitioner is less suitable for microchips."For this, readers and staff are needed, which I also search for the stolen bicycles".
GPS is too expensive."And who wants their bike to be located anywhere and at any time," says Kolb.Kolb is convinced that the advantages for insurance companies fight against bike theft and even the police were better clamped.
For example, insurance could offer their customers to only have to pay ten percent or no deductible if they had the bike registered.And the insurance companies know exactly what kind of stolen bike it was.Today the thefts are simply paid.
The police could advertise bicycles that are reported directly on the Internet in the future.If this is not possible, the officials could advise the robbery to do this himself about the register.Kolb is combative:
«You have to offer the bike thieves your forehead and show them that something is now being done.»The Internet has a large and cross -border role.«If a stolen registered bike appears in Germany or France, the owner can also be contacted from there.»
It is important, however, that the population knew that such a possibility existed at all.Bruno Angeli / Jlwww.veloregister.chwenn The bike suddenly missing what to do is look first in the surrounding area.It could be that someone only adjusted it.
If this is not the case, inquire with the police whether your bike may have been confiscated for any reason.In some cities there are specially intended bike collection points.If you do not find your bike and it was not collected by a bike collection point, get all bicycles (brand, type, color, frame and vignette number) and refund a theft display on the next police point.
If you make an advertisement, your bike will be advertised in the national search register.If it is found, you will automatically receive knowing unless you have already compensated you by your insurance company.In this case, this is the new legal owner and is then also informed.
By the way: Your bike is not sought after an advertisement with the police.If it is found, the pure coincidence.Never leave the bike unsecured and fasten in a clearly visible place at parking stands or railings with a lock. 2.With a stable, difficult to crack lock, occasional thieves can be prevented from theft.
Do not use cheap, thin cable locks, because these can be easily broken down. 3.Velo, if possible, place at the train station in a guarded bike station. 4.Velo always finished with locks in storage rooms, garages and house entrances.The government is a requested postulate to the Federal Council National Council Jean-François Steiert submitted a postulate in the Bundeshaus on March 11 of this year.
In it, he calls on the Federal Council to draw up a report that deals with the development of the bike thiefs and the recovering and return rate in Switzerland.Possible solutions against bicycle love are also to be shown.Steiert also wants to know how the currently deep recovering and return rate in cooperation with cantonal and at most municipal authorities could be significantly increased.
In the justification for the postulate, Steiert writes, among other things: «It must be checked to what extent certain data standards could be set or systems recommended.»Various private registration systems enabled the bike residents to enter their vehicle.
For the authorities, however, it is not possible to identify bicycles found due to the corresponding features for each system.Nothing has been decided yet, but Christoph Merkli, managing director of Pro Velo Switzerland, expects the postulate to achieve its effect.He expects a round table to be carried out with those involved soon.
«The postulate Steiert is not just a bike register, but above all about the fact that the Federal Council feels responsible and helps to defuse the problem of bike theft.It should also be clarified whether there should be a central register or technical standards, as Velos can be referred to, »says Merkli.banoch, but maybe not long.A bicycle register makes it easier to find reset in the event of theft.

Little well thought -out bike policy in Zurich / / on August 31, 11, MBM.In his comment on the urban initiative, Zurich is not a bicycle city and will never be.
The first is - unfortunately - to be included.The second, on the other hand, is only correct in that the political will was needed to change that.So far, this is hardly available in Zurich and is now requested by a majority of the voters.
Because facts are: A bike path network is not available in Zurich, bike paths only exist fragmentary.For example in Winterthur (Flo. Described the constructive handling of the Winterthur City Council on September 2nd), especially on dangerous intersections and branches, the breeding tracks with red asphalt covering are significantly marked and is thus signaled to the car driving so that other road users are also availablethe street.
In Zurich, however, bike tracks are largely attached where nobody - especially not car traffic - disturb them.However, if it becomes tight (and therefore mainly dangerous for the bicycle), the markings usually stop, and the bicycle travelers are left to themselves and the goodwill of the car travelers.This practice also applies at the moment, the bike tour on the redesigned smithy Wiedikon is noted.
Absurd route guides, praise to 15 centimeters of high circle, right -angled confluence in lanes or the unsuitable traffic light solution at the opera house mentioned in the article complement the image of the unenforced and uninhibited velopolitics in the city of Zurich.As a result, the bicycle travelers are often forced to seek for them themselves, often not to look for solutions in accordance with the road.
However, it is regrettable that some bicycle drivers are lacking in consideration for pedestrians and driving stupidly and dangerous.However, I believe that these excesses decreased significantly if the bike travelers in Zurich were granted more space.With the implementation of the urban initiative, it can now be clarified that the street is not only there for cars.

The Velo is the solution for almost all problems in city traffic / / Adrian Itenist Managing Director and partner of Adriano ’s
Bar & Caféin Bern.I have a split ratio for traffic - like so many things.It is completely clear to me that if we expand the highway to Zurich in six tracks, then have a traffic jam on six traces.
So, capacity brings traffic.Logically, this is also right backwards: less capacity reduces traffic.
What did I get upset when Bern halved the capacity of the main artery of city traffic over the train station.That doesn't make a big city in the world!Traffic and mobility bring growth.
That explained Ruedi Strahm so beautifully where he blamed the farmers that Bern stunted in the shade of Zurich today.The farmers did not want to give their land in Seeland for an international airport.No airport, no connection to the large wide world and the economy.
And no dispute with France about a cranked approach;-). Contrary to expectations, Bern did not go under after halving the train station.The croissant traffic through the quarters is limited, and I only dream of the ski jump tunnel.
With age, I am rushing less and less with the traffic education prescribed from above through capacity provision.For years it has not occurred to me to travel to Zurich by car.And I want to arrive in the city, so I take the bike.
At this point I have often written about my passion for mechanics and engines.Brumbrum was one of my first words.Everything that has to do with steel and sheet metal, oil and petrol and wire and cable fascinates me.
And yet I discovered the bike 10 years ago.Finally, in a useful period of A How Extreme Holligen to B and Bümpliz, without having to endure the deleted faces on the bus or tram.And you get fit for free.
I was so enthusiastic about my discovery, I pleaded for a health insurance premium reduction for bike-to-work participants.The bike is the solution for almost all city traffic problems.With more bicycles we have less noise (where Bern is sooo -sensitive), less dirt, need fewer parking garages and no four tracks through the train station.
In my opinion, everything should be done - and that is much, much more than today - to grant the Velo advance.In Ljubljana, for example, you have neat bike paths on the edge of the main traffic axes.And these bike paths always have progressed.
You cycle completely relaxed next to the traffic.Each branch must pay attention to the bicycles.Although we were with the motorcycle in Ljubljana, we cycled from the center of the tent and back from five kilometers away for two days.
I am surprised regularly when city councilors require a parking space per inhabitant of the Bern catchment area.It is a right to go to the city center with the vehicle and park.If everyone would take this right at once, we could transform the whole old town into a parking area.
I am also surprised when the SBB convert the main train station, modernize and plan and write a whopping 2000 bicycle parking spaces.With expected 120,000 to 150,000 train station users per day!I recommend that every driver who upsets over the cheeky bikers and forces themselves and his one and a half tons of sheet through the city with an average of 20 km / h.

From the pedestrian zone directly to the transitakse / / Zurich-West by Bike: This is a mixed experience.
The bike bobby speaks of a "missed opportunity".The city admits errors.By Beat Metzlerzurich - whether you want or not, pedestrians and cyclists rehearse a new cooperation in Zurich -West.
Many of the fresh bike paths lead through broad pedestrian zones.Where bikes and where feet belong, the signaling does not reveal.Everyone is allowed everywhere.
That means “mixed surface”.They are available along Pfingstweidstrasse, on the hard bridge and next to the Hardstrasse.The coexistence worked without any problems during a recent test drive because it ran as a distant coexistence.
The fact that this can quickly tip into a against each other can see who drives over the hard bridge to Zurich-West.The bus stop at the train station also serves as a Veloweg.Even at other corners or on traffic islands, “slow traffic” remain a few square meters.
During rush periods, there are quickly pushing in such places.Mixed zones comfortable cozy and careful wheel learners.You drive here without the fear of being pushed to the edge by cars.
They will like less speed.On the Pfingstweidstrasse, steeply rising sidewalk ranges regularly the way."Felgenkiller" she calls Al council Richard Wolff.
Those who don't brake get an eight.The paragraphs are required by law, as a guide for the blind.At some intersections, such as in front of the Duttweilerbrücke, cyclists also have to wait twice.
First on the edge, then on a traffic island.The cars rush through in a train.In mixed zones, it cycles safer, but also slower.
«Separated bicycle paths would have been better.There would have been enough space on Pfingstweidstrasse, »says Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo Zurich.Even with the city you can see the negative aspects.
«The basic decision was made a few years ago.At that time, the mixed area was assessed as a satisfactory solution.I am not sure whether you would decide immediately today, »says Mathias Camenzind, a bike responsible for the civil engineering office.« Highly dangerous »hardstrasseall too cozy, despite mixed zones, bike drivers cannot set up.
The trend district remains Autoland.Anyone who gives the tone here is already on the hard bridge.Cars can accelerate directly to Wipkingen via the Hochstrasse, the cyclists have to go downhill at the Hardbrücke train station on a ramp.
(If bicycles still dare across the bridge, they are hazardous to blame for stalling the car river.) The left-green majority in the municipal council wants to change this unequal treatment against the will of the city council.Hard bridge.Even under the concrete construction, it is not completely careful.
Despite bright bicycle symbols and plenty of space, the route does not always open up immediately.Mixed zones and bike paths alternate quickly.It will be "highly dangerous" on Josefstrasse, explains Gabri Petri.
Here the Hardstrasse forms U, you can swivel to the right or follow the bow back towards Escher-Wyss-Platz.«Banging cars cut off the way.I saw several fast accidents during a short observation.
Something has to change here immediately », says the VCS CO managing director and green cantonal councilor.VCS and Pro Velo therefore call for a red -colored bike.And the city should enforce speed 30 on Hardstrasse.
"The situation was judged to be demanding but surely, also during the examination by the federal specialist," says Mathias Camenzind from the civil engineering office.First all road users would have to get used to the new regime.There are no red Velostreifddem Tempo 30 on Hardstrasse, according to the traffic department.
On the other hand, red bike strips could not be implemented, since the federal government only approves them for experimental purposes.Petri and Durner continue to criticize the bicycle management over the renovated Escher-Wyss Platz: it is confusing and risky.Who, for example, from Wipkingen towards
Hardbrücke wants to meander the left of the three cars from the outside."This requires an present stop zone so that the cyclists gain a lead," says Dave Durner.The city, on the other hand, wants to guide the bike around the intersection via joint foot cycle paths.
Overall, Durner judges the bike tour through Zurich-West as a missed opportunity.«First it was planned for the tram, then for the cars and finally for the bike.You notice that.»
Mathias Camenzind, on the other hand, speaks of significant progress.«A lot of good things happened.Unfortunately, it can hardly be avoided that there are compromises with complex planning. »Two new tramliniendie line 17 drives to the Werdhölzlidie New Tram route between Escher-Wyss-Platz and Bahnhof Altstetten is used by line 4.
Instead of the 4 SER, line 17 now drives to Werdhölzli, which has the color magenta in the license plate - a light red violet.In the opposite direction, the 17er runs over the Limmatstrasse to the main train station and - like the 10, turns over Gessnerallee and Löwenplatz.There has never been a line 17 in Zurich before, and she has only been a lifespan of five years on this route.
From December 2016, the Tram Hardbrücke is scheduled to drive from Escher-Wyss-Platz to Werdhölzli, i.e. line 8, which uses the hardbrücke between Hardplatz and Hardbrücke train station and finds it back on the floor via today's car and velor lamp at Pfingstweidstrasse.For the residents of the Grünau and Hardturmstrasse, this means that they no longer have a direct connection to the main train station, but to the Helvetiaplatz and to the Sprüngli on Paradeplatz.The number of trams 17 is actually reserved for the two tram lines, which should connect via Rosengartenstrasse Zurich -Nord and Zurich -West in ten or more years.
Line 1 is also reserved - for a tram on the Hohlstrasse.The old 1 series was canceled in 1956 and replaced by the trolleybus line 31.(JR)

The Velovignette - a symbol of Swiss love for orders / / traffic · From tomorrow will be the bicycle -ovnette story.
For around 120 years, the Swiss peculiarity was a symbol for love for orders and a cantönigeist.The vignette was invented to contain the bike, carriage and pedestrian chaos on the streets.In the 1890s, there must have been quite a mess on the Swiss streets.
Cutscher, first automotive driver, pedestrian and cyclist fought for a priority on non -asphalted, dusty streets.There were no traffic rules.The result was numerous clashes, especially between coachmen and bike drivers.
Thanks to the invention of the back and hind part air tires, the latter were suddenly in masses.The bike developed into a folk vehicle - supported by Touring Club Switzerland (TCS), which at that time only campaigned for the rights of cyclists.It can be assumed that the bicycles would have often felt a Geissel, says This Oberhänsli, conservator at the Lucerne Verkehrshaus.
The struggling struggle on the Swiss streets was probably considerable.Lucerne are considered to be the inventor of road users to not leave the law of the stronger, the cantons introduced traffic rules and license plates.With the metal signs, which were mandatory for cars from 1906, all road users could be identified in the event of an accident.
In which year the first number numbers screwed and when they became mandatory is not historically proven.The history of the bike was always a bit on the side, said Oberhänsli.To date, there is unfortunately no secure data and far too little research.
However, the Lucerneers are considered the inventor of the bike number - probably because the mess on the streets there was particularly large because of the growing tourism and the many hotel vehicles.Everyone did it the other way around the bike number you can see the Swiss love of order and the need to control something with signs and rules, explains Oberhänsli.To date, no other country has a comparable insurance system for bicycles, as Switzerland has with the Vignette.
The bicycle number also stands for the typical Swiss Kantönligeist.All cantons designed their own numbers for around 60 years, with color design and shapes varied every year.It was only in the 1960s that all cantons introduced the shape of a high-edge rectangle.
Traffic house shows Vignettees, however, should still take until the end of the 1970s until one agreed on the common basic color of red.The last metal signs were punched out in 1987.For cost reasons, the vignettes were sold in the form of self -adhesive labels from 1988.
A bitter blow for many collectors because they had hardly any emotional value.The Swiss traffic center in Lucerne has a collection of around 650 license plates.The latest donations are now being included in the exhibition on the occasion of the vignette end.
Wetten adhesive light The velovignette is no longer mandatory in the new year.This means that all cyclists themselves are responsible for their insurance cover.
In the event of an accident, this can be expensive for those 10 percent of the Swiss who have not yet afforded liability insurance.Bike drivers do not normally do a lot of mischief.If you cause an accident, in most cases only a car royal series is harmed.
Insurance Axa Winterthur estimates the average costs at around CHF 2000.If people are injured, this amount can increase sharply.Axa Winterthur, for example, has dealt with several cases in recent years in which the damage amount was over 500,000 francs.
In the event of an unmoved case, it even estimates the damage at around two million francs.So far, these accident drivers were automatically insured through the vignette.The national guarantee funds (NGF) are still available for hardship cases.
This always steps in when an uninsured person cannot pay the damage himself - with up to two million francs per case.However, this is not free.A repayment plan is developed with the cause.

Rent bikes will soon be on the road / / by Martin Regenass Basel.Tamara Bozovic from Lausanner Velopass GmbH is pleased when she learns on the phone that the Basel government council spoke CHF 50,000 for the pilot project yesterday.
This means that nothing should stand in the way of the bicycle loan system.In spring, customers could then rent bicycles at five different locations in Basel, Riehen and Weil am Rhein.The Basel Kantonalbank on Spiegelgasse, the Tinguely Museum, the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen, the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, the SBB station and possibly the Badische Bahnhof are planned as locations.
"It is a kind of cultural network that should enable visitors to the museums and other interested mobility by bike," says Bozovic, project manager at Velopass.It should be eight to ten rental bikes per station.The day ticket will cost seven francs and can be bought from the museums, at the train station or from the bank.
The construction and traffic department of the Canton of Basel-Stadt also wanted to realize a pilot project for two anniversary.The Veloverleih project, which is internal for Velopass, has now been put on hold with the financial support for Velopass.«We decided that because the Velopass project is already at an advanced stage.
We will pursue the project and see what experiences are being had, »says Martina Münch, Head of Design urban space in the construction and traffic department.In doing so, knowledge should be obtained about the usage behavior of the customers, the target group or acceptance among the population.The Velopass project runs over two years as a pilot project.
And with a success?"It is clearly a limited attempt with a location permit of two years," says Münch.Prohibition of the cityscape commission Hand kiss for the project is the Velopass company because it won the “Ideas for Basel” competition for the 111-year anniversary of the Basel Kantonalbank.
This contributes 70,000 francs to the bike loan system.Velopass is currently operating bicycle stations in eleven different cities in western Switzerland and Ticino.In German -speaking Switzerland, Basel is to become Velopass's first destination.
Pro Velo of both Basel looks forward to the project with mixed feelings.«We are glad that rental bike systems are finally going forward.However, we have the feeling that the project is too small in this size, »says Roland Chrétien from Pro Velo.
The managing director estimates the chances of success if stations are set up in other locations.The Velopass project in Basel has already been on the brink financially, says Bozovic.For example, no money could be generated with advertising space at the stations.
This is due to an objection by the cityscape commission.According to Münch, this has negatively commented on a preliminary study with visualizations.Advertising on the bicycles themselves, on the other hand, is possible and there are sponsors who are committed to the project without public appearance.
The question remained open yesterday how many bicycles it will be at SBB station.There, PostBus AG is raising a Velomietstation.However, this should be compatible with the bicycle bicycles.

The bike lobby is calling for a hundred lending stations for bicycles / / traffic policy · In Paris, Barcelona or Biel, rental stations for Velos have long been part of the cityscape.
Now the Bernese authorities also clarify the advantages and disadvantages of the so-called bikesharing.The city of Bern could also face the forecast traffic gain in the next few years.In order to counteract an overload of the streets and public transport, the Feuss and Velo-Transport department is now examining whether a bikesharing system in the city of Bern makes sense.
Using an electronic card system, registered users could independently borrow bikes at several locations and bring back later.The loan and return locations can be different.
The Bielers do it in front of many cities in Europe, but some cities in western Switzerland have already had a nationwide bike rental system.The city of Biel started a test phase in 2010."The evaluations have shown that the users are satisfied with the bikesharing system," said Jonas Schmid from the operator Velospot Biel.
Eight percent of the users switched from the car to the rental bike, a good third of the public transport turns into a two -wheeler.Roland Pfeiffer from the Foot and Velo-Transport department of the city of Bern sees the idea a little more critical: "The previous experiences show that there is no major transfer effect from the car to the bike," said Pfeiffer.
«In Bern, 100,000 bicycles also come to 138,000 inhabitants.So the Bernese are already on the road with the two -wheeler."The President of Pro Velo Bern, Stefan Jordi,, on the other hand, emphasizes:" If the city of Bern works with the surrounding communities, the potential of commuters would be larger who would do without the car because they conveniently with rental bikes to the jobs in the agglomerationcould drive.»
Close cooperation with the entire region is therefore important.A nationwide network of the loan locations is also essential so that using the loan remain attractive.The current bike rental system Bern rolls with its three lending locations does not meet the demands of the population.
Nothing decided to keep the system user -friendly, the city of Bern expects around 100 required loan stations."We are now carefully checking the cost-benefit factor and demand," says Roland Pfeiffer.“The city authorities do not want to rush because the optimal provider of a bikesharing system has not yet been found.»
In autumn, the city council will be able to decide on the first concrete plans.Selina Stuckiso could look a loan station: registered users access to the bicycles with a bathroom.

Now the Velo House suppliers / / Langenthal · New offer in the city:
As of this Saturday, the population has a Velo house delivery service.If you have to make a larger purchase, you like to take the car - so that you have enough space and don't have to carry everything home.From this weekend there is a clean alternative: the bike house delivery service.
There is a sponsoring association behind the new range of services, which also includes the city and so far a large distributor (Migros).Last but not least, the Velo house delivery service is also an opportunity for unemployed people.That is why the management of the Velo house delivery service lies in the hands of the PVB Maxi.mumm, an urban institution for professional integration.
The fact that the cyclists are already ready to go was shown at the presentation of the new home delivery service.Michel Kramer from Herzogenbuchsee and the Lower Bipper Dominik Haudenschild have already done a few rounds with their sponsored flyer bikes, in tow the trusses for the goods.The two mid -twenties are not beginners, as they already entered the pedals in Burgdorf for the house delivery service there.
Now you can bring in your know-how in Langenthal and make it easier to start.For the time being, the home delivery service team consists of five bicycles.The headquarters are located at Bahnhofstrasse 37, in a Hal-Le of the former Merkur printing house.
Christa Toggenburger, head of the PVB Maxi.mumm, said yesterday that a “fan base” for the home delivery service was now to be set up and winning members for the sponsoring association.«Our goal is to strengthen Langenthal as a shopping location.“This is also in the sense of Mayor Thomas Rufener.
The bike house delivery service is "very meaningful" for Langenthal, "he said.The new offer can help to relieve the city center from traffic.And it is always good for the image.

Mobility concept can be worthwhile / / from Rolf Zenzlenbasel.
Peter Eichenberger, director of the Claraspital, drives the bike to work every day.He makes his contribution to the Claramobil mobility concept introduced in 2008.At that time, the parking lot regulations were changed: justification to a free parking space only have employees whose ways of working with public transport would take longer than 45 minutes.
In addition, the Claraspital has created new bicycle spaces, published its own bike card and set up a location for a mobility car.The Claramobil project was introduced as part of a campaign launched by energy chiefs, which is aimed at companies with over 50 employees.Basel-Stadt also participates in the campaign.
By 2012, the canton wanted to win 10 to 15 other companies with a free impulse advice for mobility management.But this latte was too high, as project manager Antje Hammer from the Office for Mobility explains.«There are relatively few companies interested in it.
Not only in Basel, also in Zurich.»So far, eight companies, including Manor, Basler Versicherung, Implenia, and various old people's homes have been advised in Basel."Many companies have no problem pressure in the area of mobility," says Hammer.
Mobility management was born no more annoying search traffic in Claraspital.In 2006 there was a lack of parking space around the hospital, residents felt molested by search traffic."We should have done something anyway," says Eichenberger.
The impulse advice was valuable and brought many ideas on how to improve the situation.Eichenberger emphasizes that the mobility concept also had a positive impact on the satisfaction of the employees.“People who are now coming with the bike are less sick and more resilient.»
Because fewer parking spaces have to be maintained, infrastructure costs have also decreased.In the campaign period 2009 to 2012, Roche is the only Basel company that has definitely introduced a mobility concept.However, not entirely voluntary: the government and parliament had insisted on it in the development plan for the 175 -meter high office tower.
The centerpiece of the concept is a parking space management, explains spokeswoman Silvia Dibry: "Only employees have a parking space claim whose ways of working with public transport take longer than 45 minutes." The company transfers a mobility bonus of CHF 480per year .Anyone who is entitled to a parking space and claims it pays the corresponding amount as a fee.Among other things, Roche has also set up an electronic tool for a carpool.
Roche does not announce how much the measures cost.An analysis of the mobility concept is currently underway."The results will be known at the end of May," explains Dibry.
It is open whether and how the campaign continues from Energy Chewers.In summer, the Federal Office of Energy decides whether the program will be extended by three years.It is clear: Until the end of June, Basler companies can still register for the cantonal office for mobility for free impulse advice.

Pro Velo is planned against the tram axis / / city of Berndie through bulwark and storage mass bring great conflicts for cyclists, finds per bike.
The association therefore rejects the variant.Tram rails and stops are dangerous for cyclists - according to Pro Velo, regular reports are confirmed by the Tram Bern West.Now new rails are already planned in the city, which "narrow the short space for bike drivers," writes Pro Velo.
The association thus refers to the planned tram axle via bulwark and storage mass.Of course, public transport supports per bike.However, the goals in the tram network should not re -destroy the goals to promote bicycle traffic again, according to Pro Velo.
The proposed variant ensure great conflicts for safe bike.The main axis between Schanzenstrasse and Hirschengraben is impaired by additional interruptions.The same applies to the rail -free Bahnhofplatz and the bulwark today.
From Velosicht, a lines by Bundesgasse offer much less potential for conflict than what is now intended.Pro Velo calls for measures to clear the disadvantages for cyclists.If this does not succeed, prove to reject the so-called “Altstadt Nord” variant.

Daniel Leupi will set markings / / until the end of 2014 the city of Zurich wants to make 25 bike routes more secure over 100 kilometers.Construction measures to close gaps in the cycle path network will follow the Velo master plan until the end of the year.
Stefan Hotzein breakthrough cannot be reported.Zurich is not yet in a very good place when it comes to promoting bicycles, police board member Daniel Leupi found in front of the media on Tuesday.
Larger structural interventions for new, attractive bike compounds took more time.They are the subject of the Velo master plan, which the traffic department of the city police draws on together with the civil engineering office and which is to be decided by the city council in the second half of the year.More red bike strips of bicycles do not have to be patient for too long, Leupi has earned the order earlier to make the existing routes more visible and at least to close gaps in the signaling.
After two connections were made safer in 2011, five more were added this year.For example, bicycles on the Routen Sihlfeldstrasse - Beatenplatz, Albisriederplatz - Sihlhölzli, Irchelpark - Forch, Oerlikon - Schaffhauserplatz and Limmatplatz - Oerliker Park from improvements.These do not correspond to a throw, but consist of numerous individual measures.
This includes marking wheel strips, increasingly also with red color.This is currently permitted in Zurich as an attempt, but Leupi emphasized that the Federal Council has now proposed to the parliament to create a legal basis for this.Furthermore, the signaling and the right of ways were checked and adjusted where necessary.
The aim is that at least on these routes cyclists always recognize where the Veloweg continues.On the 7 routes with a length of 21.3 kilometers, over 4000 meters of wheel stripes were marked, 251 pictograms were attached, 120 signs renewed, 62 signaling and 27 systems for traffic regulation adjusted and 6 structural measures implemented.That cost around CHF 200,000, another 100,000 francs are approved by the end of the year.
This improved three other routes along the Sihl, between the Oerlikon and Affoltern stations as well as between Höngg and Albisrieden.By the end of 2014, 25 routes with a total length of 100 kilometers should be renovated.Light signal only for Velosdann there are innovations that, as mostly when it comes to bicycle traffic, do not grown on Zurich's crap.
In the future, there will be combined signals for pedestrians and cyclists.Half -heeled traffic lights are new only for bicycles.A prototype is on the corner of Falkenstrasse /
Utoquai in operation, 20 other locations are clarified.The bike parking spaces at train stations remain one topic.But just, structural measures take time, and "it is not that everything flows in one direction", as Leupi noticed.

The cyclist and the tram rail / / Velopneus should no longer get stuck in tram tracks.The SP of the city of Zurich asks the city council to show solutions.
A test in Geneva shows how difficult it is.Reto Scherrernicht Always optimally complement public transport and slow traffic.So and again a bicycle slips into a tram rail, which often results in a fall and recalls that the two means of transport are not fully compatible.
Such conflicts and dangers should now be cleared out according to the will of the SP.Next Wednesday, the Zurich town council will deal with a postulate of two SP municipal councilors with whom the city council is asked to present solutions to improve this situation.According to the postulants' ideas, the tram rails, especially on places and intersections, could be safely passable for the bicycle drivers with elastic material, rubber ripidi, feathers or the like.
The city council is proposed to write out an ideas competition.It is not the first time that the city deals with this question.More than five years ago, the VBZ tested the use of a kind of rubber riper on a short section - unsuccessfully.
Some of the railroads of the railway have the same system in part;However, since the frequency and the speed of the rail vehicles are much lower there, the rubber parts last longer.In 2007, the city council therefore saw no "meaningful" opportunities for investing in the tramschienslienset network.
In knowledge of this attitude, the SP submitted its postulate, the rejection of which the city council immediately requested.The business has been pending for two and a half years.During this time something has happened on the rail market.
The company Strail from Germany, specializing in level crossings, launched its Velostrail product.According to the company, this is "the only functioning system that eliminates the groove groove".It is currently being tested on two very short distances in Geneva.
There is no evaluation;However, the first feedback indicates satisfied cyclists.On the other hand, no one has a word about the costs.
On request, only the manufacturer reveals that an average of around 1000 euros per running meter can be expected.If all 113.4 kilometers of the city of the rail network were so equipped, the invoice would be around CHF 136 million.However, the postulants do not demand this.
For them, the focus is on intersections, but the system is not suitable for.To make matters worse, Velostrail has a life expectancy of 1 million axle survival.This value would be reached on the Zurich Quai bridge, the most busy route, after around 82 days.

Velo instead of Métro / / Philipp Metzler · There is an alternative to the Métro ride in the French metropolis: the near-free bike, "Le Vélib".
Whether Ile-de-paris, Latin or Marais Quartier, the “Vélo à Libre Service” (“Vélib”) is omnipresent in Paris.The robust gray-brown rental bikes stand on every corner, cleaned cleanly in their docking stations.Since 2007, the city administration has built up a nationwide network with over 1500 automatic rental stations, which is very popular with locals and tourists.
The annual subscription for the Parisian “Vélibistes” only costs 19 euros, tourists pay 1 euro 70 for a service life of 24 hours.First velo -way reveloing in Paris with his murderous traffic?What sounds dangerous and unusual is actually quite unproblematic.
Of course, despite the newly flamed love for slow traffic, the metropolis is far from a "bicycle city".But the streets are wide, so that you can move to some extent.Automobilists and moped drivers also seem to have got used to cyclists, and on many bus strips it is officially allowed to ride a bike.
Along the Seine there are even real bike paths, according to the city administration, a few hundred kilometers.Only the registration procedure is somewhat complicated, which sometimes leads to helpless faces in front of the distribution machine.Hardly in the saddle, you realize why the gentle shape of the urban locomotion is so popular:
It is a great feeling to cover the route between two sights on the bike.You experience the city from a completely different perspective, and this progress is much more relaxed than the hat in the Paris subsoil.The circulation of the Arc de Triomphe, for example, is unforgettable, which is quite possible thanks to the very generous dimension of the square despite traffic.
A total of over 20,000 rental bikes are available for discovery tours in Paris.The first 30 minutes are free, then you pay every half hour.This system warns for frequent changes, so that a free bike can usually be found even in the high season.
You grab a “Vélib” and, if you arrive at the finish, you will be scheduled again at the next rental station.The replacement of the wheels is simple and in the shortest possible time.What the French is particularly pleased about: The new love for two -wheeler spills over to other cities.
Soon it will soon be ready in New York, the Velib blog is rejoiced: there the New York City Bike Share day is to start service.Get free map “Paris à Vélo” or app, bike paths are marked there.

System for rental bikes is stuck / / by Martin Regenass Basel.In the city quickly climb on a station to a rental bike, cycle from A to B and set the bike again at another location:
That would have been a good thing for tourists, visitors or commuters, but in the near future there will be an impossibility.In February it was said that it should be so far this summer.The Velopass company, which operates rental systems in eleven western Switzerland and Ticino cities, also planned four such biking stations with several bikes in Basel.
For this two -year pilot project, the Basler Kantonalbank (BKB) would have contributed CHF 70,000.The money was spoken as part of the “Ideas for Basel” competition on the occasion of the 111th anniversary.The Basel government council for the operation of the planned Velopass bicycle system was added to Velopass for another CHF 50,000 for 2012.
But the project is now on ice.The funds are sisted, Velopass is no longer in charge.Reason: The Velopass company bought from Postauto Switzerland AG last April and was incorporated into public public.
PubliBike has been renting six bicycles in the SBB station since December 2011."The Basel pilot bike sharing network did not come about within a useful period because the financing was not final and sustainable and the locations were not completely clarified," says Katharina Merkle, media spokeswoman at Postauto Switzerland AG.It was the idea to build the rental systems at isolated museum locations.
"However, only tourists and neither the population nor business travelers had been addressed on one side," says Merkle.Now the ball for the implementation of a bike loan lies again with the canton.Again, because the construction and traffic department of the canton of Basel-Stadt has stopped an administrative project called Veloverlan because of Velopass's planned bikesharing.
This was said in February, because the Velopass project was already in an advanced stage."We wanted to see what experiences Velopass is doing with the pilot project in the city and how the use and acceptance of the population fails," says Barbara Auer, project manager mobility planning in the construction and traffic department.Competition is advertised that you have to start zero again in Basel with a bike loan.
Or in other words: The construction and traffic department now wants to search for a suitable provider via public tender.“To make a statement about the time frame is difficult at the moment.We first have to apply for money from the government council for the submission procedure, »says Auer.
Roland Chrétien from Pro Velo of both Basel is convinced that a bicycle loan system in Basel would have potential.«However, you have to look closely at which system for Basel is the optimal and compare different systems.People without bike would probably use it spontaneously, »says the managing director.
For example, there are bicycle loan systems in Lucerne.Zurich wants to offer one in two years.Chrétien is interesting to find the system called Velospot of the city of Biel.
By the end of August, 250 rental bikes should be in the city at various locations.The Seeländer started with 40 bicycles, equipped with a short -haul radio.This enables Velospot operators to display on their website at which ward there are how many bicycles.
If you borrow a bike at a station, you are not obliged to bring it back to this point.Inspiration from France the City of Biel developed the system with partners itself and was inspired by French systems such as those in Paris or Lyon.
The global budget for the system between 2010 and 2013 was around CHF 1.5 million.An annual subscription costs CHF 60, the first half hour is included in the price.After that, it costs two francs per hour.
A day ticket for 24 hours costs CHF 10.The future should show which bicycle loan system is introduced in Basel.The BKB may then also contribute the CHF 70,000 from the "Ideas for Basel" pot.
Mats Bachmann, media spokesman for BKB: «Sure, a faster implementation would have been desirable.We now observe the development and then decide in an advanced stage how we invest the money.»

There is hardly any trouble about the lack of bike paths at the Bellevue / / at one of the most important traffic hubs.The city is now planning improvements.
By Tina Fassbindzurich - «We are aware that the situation is not optimal for cyclists.However, it will improve in the next three to five years, »promises Urs Walter, project manager mobility and traffic in the civil engineering office.There are two delicate corners at the Bellevue:
On the one hand, you can go straight into the quaian position from Limmatquai, but this is not possible in the opposite direction.On the other hand, the transition area between Quaibrücke and Utoquai is a sticking point for the planners.“This corner on which the listed tree avenue begins is extremely confusing, and it is used by both footmakers and cyclists.
This regularly leads to delicate situations, »says Walter."We do not have a hit parade of the urban needle tube for cyclists, but this position would be certainly in the top ten." Rämistrasse is a second candidate for this hit list.
“We check various optimizations in the street cross -section there to improve the situation for bicycle travelers.In the lower area of the street, however, I see few opportunities for optimizations, »admits Walter.For this there will soon be a bike strip towards Quaibrücke on the road train in front of Café Felix.
In order to make enough space for a bike path from Rämistrasse directly to the bridge, according to Walter the lanes and the tram island would be minimally adjusted.The situation for cyclists is also to be improved on the Quai bridge itself with the planned renovation from 2015."The Kande-Laber should be moved in order to achieve a clearer separation of the bicycle and pedestrian area." However, many projects to improve the bike route on Bellevueplatz depend on the outcome of the vote on the redesign of the Sechseläutenplatz on September 23.
If the vocal people say yes, a bike path separated from the pedestrian area will be created around the square.In the future, a crossing from the Quaian layers in the direction of Limmatquai should also be possible."I am confident that we can close this gap in the next few years," says Walter.

Velostadt now / / by Daniel Wienerda's summer theater for the delay of the rental bike stations in Basel is only the tip of the iceberg.It is the (for the time being) the last chapter of a tragedy that could result in a vertical chance.
Once there was the Velostadt Basel.Cycling was already popular in the 1970s, even on government councilors and company bosses.Shortly afterwards there were first loans to expand the cycle paths and traces.
Veloparking at SBB station - although it is too small from the start - was a pioneering act in its kind.Buyers from e-bikes received government subsidies for over a decade.This is no coincidence, as Basel has all conceivable advantages for bicycles: mainly flat terrain, wide main roads, mild, relatively rainy climate and take -away options for bicycles in bus and tram.
Then other cities of Basel started cycling.They discovered the bike as a mode of transport and systematically expanded the bike paths.Special safety precautions for bicycles were planned at neuralgian bodies, while most bike strips end in Basel exactly where it becomes dangerous for two -wheelers.
Green wave for bike?Everyday life in Copenhagen, unknown with us!E-bike sharing?
In Zurich soon reality, a foreign word in Basel!Bike rental?In the infancy!Velopark fields have been increased at most in recent years, more often forgotten and are sometimes hopelessly transferred.
We still dream of obstacle-free remote connections to the surrounding valleys, while other cities lay out long-distance cyclists with “bike carways” the red carpet.In the event of snowfall, these routes are the first to be plowed.If Basel has to plow, the slush is located on the bike strip for days.
The reasons for the worldwide bike euphoria are obvious: less pollution, healthy moving population, relief for individual motorized and public transport, better climate balance.And it only comes cheaper, both for the state as well as for companies and private individuals.As a global success story of urban planning and as a tourism magnet, the topic of bike is suitable as no other.
Both in Paris and in Berlin, every stranger is immediately drawn to how great the offer is for bicycles (in reality the first positive approaches are shown).In contrast, the rating of Velostadt is actually justified in Münster (North Rhine-Westphalia) or Freiburg im Breisgau.Basel still has a year or two so as not to miss this train or this bike.
The starting point is still good, but the deeds are too little strategic, too selective and take too much time.It takes a jerk that goes through all parties for a Velostadt Basel now!www.unserekleinestadt.ch

The potential has systematically collected data on strategic points for bicycle traffic since 2009.These show that on Zurich streets more bicycles are constantly driving.
But the number of accidents has also increased significantly.Jonathan Pärlidas Velo seems to be gaining importance in the city of Zurich.For example, 20 percent more bike rides were measured at the automatic bike counting point on Lux-Guyer-Weg in November 2009:
In 2010, the concreted induction loops were run over an average of 610 times a day, a year later 730 times.The total of nine measuring stations counted 2.6 million bike rides.The bicycle -friendly weather played a role in the increase, but does not explain it completely, as the evaluation of the civil engineering office shows.
Motorists had to put bike traffic in the city inappropriate, at the latest since the acceptance of the ambitious urban initiative last September has been political agenda.Today's car and frequent drivers should switch to the bike.
This is the only way to achieve 10 percentage points stipulated in the municipal regulations in motorized private transport at overall traffic.Today, according to the latest figures of the federal government, this proportion is around 30 percent, that of the bike.In order to draw a more precise picture of today's bicycle traffic, statistics city of Zurich, the service department and the municipal civil engineering office have published an analysis under the title “Fest in the saddle” on Thursday.
In it, the latest figures are compiled, use and safety of the bike are compiled and evaluated.The aim is to infer decisions about funding measures with the necessary facts.For this purpose, the network of counting stations had also been set up.
Two out of three city residents have a bike, but only a third uses it regularly.For Simon Villiger of Statistics City of Zurich, the other third, who stores the bike in the basement, shows that the potential for bicycle traffic has not yet been exhausted.At the same time, he is boasting that you are almost as fast as you are by bike on distances of up to five kilometers in the city in the city as with the tram or by car.
They are rather short distances in the city center, on which the bike is used the most with a share of almost 10 percent of all trips.Driving in the city in the city is perceived as dangerous by many.Even with those who are regularly traveling by bike, according to a survey of the city, a little more than every second person feels "often insecure".
The accident statistics seem to agree with this assessment, even if in absolute numbers there are significantly more car than bike accidents.Half of bike accidents have increased since 2006.The authors of the analysis expressly attribute this increase in undisciplined driving behavior, but to the general increase in bicycle traffic.
A comparatively large number of accidents are in circle 1, where the traffic density is highest.In circles 4 and 5, more accidents occur than elsewhere.According to Wernher Brucks from the traffic department, no connection between gaps in the route network and the probability of accident can be determined.
How e-bikes affect traffic safety can not be said at the moment because the data situation is still insufficient.The only thing that is certain is that the sales of e-bikes increase at the expense of everyday bike.Many cyclists feel uncertain in the city due to a lack of their own trace, but their number tends to increase.

· The analysis “Festival in the Sattel” about bike traffic in the city of Zurich also lists a whole series of numbers for accidents.For example, it turns out that the afflicted everyday and sports bike are balanced.
The accidents are 60 percent collisions with cars and 17 percent self -accidents.In 8 percent of cases, covers with foot goers, which in turn are violated in 87 percent of these cases.From a bike side, men between the ages of 30 and 49 are most often involved in accidents.

Velos do not solve traffic problems / / assume that bikes are prohibited in the city of Zurich.How much should the infrastructures of public transport, motorized private transport and foot traffic be expanded?
I say: Not at all because the bike does not wear traffic load in bad weather.The redundant bicycle infrastructure of the city of Zurich is good and free of charge for those who may not want to pay a tram ticket.The city administration should propagate the bike infrastructure as what it is-not as a solution to a traffic problem.
And what the continuousness of the city center, bike stations at the main train station (large, but only with the capacity of a single train) should also be used.The bike stations belong to peripheral stops.Hansuli Anderegg, Zurich

Abstell / / Velo driving with navigation system is much too dangerous July 31st, a navigation device for bicycle travelers was presented in this newspaper and a possible bike tour from the church field via Marzili to the Belp airfield and via Auguetbrücke and Elfenau back into the center.
It is just bad luck that there is a general driving ban from the Auguet Bridge to the Elfenau.Here it means: push bike!The Pro Velo Bern Velostadt Plan is very suitable for route planning.
In addition, a bike without brakes was shown in the picture, a so -called fixie (with rigid run).These are prohibited in traffic.I consider this navigation device to be very dangerous for bicycle drivers, because the use strongly distracts from the attention in traffic.
Hans Dällenbach, Liebefeldstefan Ropac, BikecityGuide Apps OG, takes a position as follows: We look forward to suggestions for improvement.To the photo: We decided to provide this picture of the press because our product is clearly visible.
However, we will withdraw it from the press area because we do not want to advertise illegal means of transportation.To the tour: We have to admit that we made a mistake.The sliding route is not marked in the description.
A change in the route course does not make sense, otherwise a detour of around 13 kilometers will arise.In addition, a representative of the municipality of Muri assured us that the relevant section should be released in the coming spring.With the next update, however, we will insert the note that the bike must be pushed on the section in question.

Bike drivers are pushing for the fast lane / / traffic · The interest association Pro Velo wants to force the BUND for a traffic shift in favor of the bicycle by initiative.
Autobahn feeling on the bike, with a bumpy covering, overtaking lane, breakdown strips and winter guaranteed snow freedom?This could become a reality in Swiss agglomeration if Pro Velo Switzerland realizes what she announced yesterday in the “NZZ on Sunday”.Jean-François Steiert, SP National Council and President of the Pro Velo, would like to launch a popular initiative and thus anchor the promotion of bicycle traffic in the constitution.
According to Steiert, the initiative text has not yet been formulated.However, it is obvious that Pro Velo wants to hire the federal government to explicit destinations to shift from the car to the bike.Whether the initiative will actually be launched depends on whether there is political allies per bike for their concerns.
The most spectacular of Pro Velo is so -called bicycles.These are exclusively reserved, wide express streets in the commuting perimeter, such as those in flat countries such as the Netherlands or Denmark.Almost two years ago, a corresponding sketch of ideas for the Bern region submitted per Velo Bern.
With the rapid emergence of faster electrobics, the security situation has worsened.There are more dangerous overtaking maneuvers on the narrow bike strips.In addition, with the e-bike on shuttle routes up to 20 kilometers, you are often faster at work today than by car or public transport.

In the worst case, there is a risk of bicycle bans / / the number of bikers who, despite the ban on their bike to the Uetliberg, is increasing.Faithful can no longer be lost.
By Tina Fassbindzurich-No bicycles may be transported between Uitikon-Waldegg and Uetliberg on the trains of the S 10 of the Sihltal-Zürich-Uetliberg-Bahn (Szu).This ban was introduced in mid -2005 with the aim of containing the so -called downhilling with heavy mountain bikes - especially on hiking trails.It was all the more a passenger when he recently had to share the compartment with seven "downhillers" and her clay -masked bikes.
Visitors to the Zurich local mountain have been meeting such scenes more and more recently, because according to Szu spokesman Armin Hehli, the number of bikers who, despite the ban on the train, has increased with their bicycles on the Uetliberg, since the change of the transport law two years ago.The ban on velomite was still confirmed in this way and also confirmed by the Federal Office of Transport."Since the ban is a so -called house rules, a violation, on the other hand, can no longer be sanctioned by buses with the new legislation." Trouble about inconsideral bikers, they can only be pointed out from the train.
«There are always those who don't want to get out.This also makes the other rail passengers angry because there are delays."The whole thing is a very unpleasant and still unsolved problem for the SZU," says Hehli.
Therefore, clarifications for the implementation of the house rules with sanctions are currently underway.These efforts are welcomed by Grün Stadt Zurich."The maintenance of the ban on transport is an important piece of the puzzle in the overall concept" Hiking and cycling on the Uetliberg "," emphasizes Regina Wollmann, product manager in the city of Zurich.
In the meantime, more and more people would go to the mountain with e-bikes.That is why Grün Stadt Zurich cannot avoid working in the local recreation area for the local population.«But it is not our job to provide a bike offer for people from all over Switzerland.
With increasing pressure to use, there is a risk of escalation.In the worst case, there is a bicycle ban on the Uetliberg. »However, all forest roads and paths are still available to cyclists.For security reasons, a general driving ban only applies to a few, very steep paths - according to police controls and buses are often carried out there.

Zurich is not a bicycle city / / in Zurich, where around CHF 70 million are to be invested in the promotion of bicycle traffic by 2025, just 6 percent of all ways will be covered by bike.Only in St. Gallen is the lack of interest on the two -wheeler even greater.
Christina Neuhausin no other city in Switzerland are as many cyclists on the road as in Basel.This is shown by a comparison study by the cities of Zurich, Winterthur, St. Gallen, Basel, Bern and Lucerne, who want to work more closely together in transport policy.In the comparison year 2010, the Basel residents covered 16 percent of their ways on the bike.
In Winterthur, the self -proclaimed Velostadt, it is 13 percent.In Zurich, on the other hand, where a politically dominant role plays the topic of bicycle traffic and each household has an average of 1.4 bicycles, the proportion of bicycle traffic in total traffic is just 6 percent.Only the St. Galler make themselves even less out of the bike:
In the hilly Gallus city, only 3 percent of all ways are covered on the bike.Hope for the comfort of the Zürcher on the bicycle.In addition to the topography, the not continuous velonetz and the fact that you can ride badly bicycles in Deux pièces and suit, the well-developed public transport should also play a significant role:
Almost a third of Stadtzürcher Traffic (32 percent) eliminate public transport (Winterthur 19 percent).With your own car, 25 percent are on the Limmat, 36 percent in Winterthur.It is no surprise that the interest in the two -wheeler in Zurich is rather moderate.
The red-green dominated city council is therefore dedicated to bicycle traffic in the Limmatstadt and wants to double its share in the total traffic volume by 2025.Around CHF 55 million will be spent on improving the infrastructure in the next 12 years.150 kilometers of new bicycle paths are planned, with a third of this route to be designed as a “comfort route” for inexperienced cyclists.
According to the plans of the city council, another CHF 12 million are to be issued for prevention campaigns.In view of the goal of the agency to bring the Zurichers into the saddle, it is not surprising that the responsible civil engineering office comments on the comparative figures that are sobering for Zurich unmoved.In a media release, the low bike content of the overall traffic is only noted on the side and pointed out succinctly to "that it should be increased with the master plan Velo and as part of the" City Transport 2025 ".On the other hand, the Zurichers confirm a total Swiss trend:
In the larger cities, the proportion of public transport is significantly larger than that of motorized private transport.At the same time, fewer and fewer city dwellers have their own car.In Zurich, for example, every second household does without a car.
In contrast, it is even more important in the smaller cities.With a share of 36 percent car trips in overall traffic, Winterthur would be fairer to the “Autostadt” label than that of the “Velostadt”.As can be seen from the comparison study, your own car in all six cities, despite public transport and bike funding measures, is still taken for short and shortest routes.
In the city of Zurich, for example, almost every second car ride is in a distance of 5 kilometers.7 percent of all car journeys are eliminated on distances that measure less than 1 kilometer.The compared cities show big differences in the parking situation.
In the city of Zurich there is only a fifth of the 259 358 parking spaces on public ground (19 percent).In Basel and Bern, the corresponding shares are significantly higher with 31 and 24 percent.There are no figures from Winterthur about the parking situation.
Noise problems in Zurichob in the city of Zurich are undertaken by large EFFORTS for traffic calming, the noise pollution of the population is nowhere as big as the Limmat.54 percent of Stadtzürcher streets are traffic -calmed (in Basel 63, in Bern 61, 34 percent in Winterthur);However, a third of the city dwellers live on streets where the nightly immission limit is exceeded.
For a quarter of all Zurich women, noise pollution is too big during the day.In Winterthur, the exceeding of the immission limit values for 18 percent of the population is a problem.However, only 2 to 4 percent of the Zurich population live in areas where even the alarm value is exceeded.

More comfort for cyclists / / mbm.· At the beginning of November, the city of Zurich presented its plans for the expansion of the Velonetz.
Without knowing precise numbers, bicycle traffic should be doubled until 2025.Masterplan Velo is the name of the project, for which almost CHF 70 million are budgeted.Now a first section in the “Tagblatt of the City of Zurich” has been publicly advertised.
The plan requirement begins on Friday, February 22nd, and ends 30 days later.This is a section of the so -called comfort route.This is created in order to enable less experienced people to drive, it is wide and separated from the rest of the traffic.
The implementation is not expected before 2014/15.The advertised project concerns the Seefeldquai between Bellerive and Feldeggstrasse.Although there is already a route for cyclists there, it should be expanded and run next to the pedestrian traffic.
According to Stefan Hackh, the spokesman for the municipal civil engineering office, the project provides to completely separate the pedestrians and the cyclists.The lake facility is said to be reserved solely to the pedestrians.Of course, it takes more space for this - you take it in the parking lots.
78 parking fields are available in the Frascati restaurant in the Frascati restaurant.In summer, when the restaurant also serves outside, there are 50 parking spaces.33 parking fields should be left all year round.
These are arranged differently and slightly enlarged because of the adaptation to today's norms.The bottom line is 45 parking spaces that are nowhere to be compensated for.As Hackh continues, the parking fields in Seefeldquai do not fall under the historical compromise.
He refers to the new Opéra Parking nearby.For SVP councilor Mauro Tuena, this project is outrageous, as he said on request.The parking spaces at the “Frascati” are very popular and very occupied.
In addition, there are too few parking spaces in the Seefeld.The SVP will surely participate in the participation procedure and express concerns.Maybe it should also be done on a parliamentary path.
The FDP of the city of Zurich also wants to get involved in the participation procedure, as municipal councilor Marc Bourgeois said.There are too many parking spaces at stake, so you have to weigh up added value for cyclists and the disadvantages for drivers and look for alternatives.Bourgeois also wants to have clarity when financing.

City moves the construction of the promised Velo Bridge over the Sihl / / The residents of Wiedikon must continue to take detours if they want to go to the HB with the bike.By Tina Fassbindzurich - The Zurich city council has set itself the goal of promoting bike traffic in the city.
The specially elaborated Velo master plan provides, among other things, to improve the security of the infrastructure for cyclists, to reduce obstacles and to increase comfort.But of all people, the residents of the densely populated Friesenberg in Wiedikon and the booming Binz are still waiting for a direct and safe route from their city circle to the main train station.The busy manessestrasse-it is passed at peak times of up to 1400 vehicles per hour-the Sihl and the tracks of the Sihltal-Zurich-Uetliberg-Bahn (SZU) have so far made a trip impossible without detours.
A year ago everything looked as if the road construction project on Manessestrasse was also built a foot and bike bridge over the street and the Sihl.The civil engineering office put on the plans for the corresponding project between March and April 2012.In the “Report on the not taken into account on the plan requirement”, it can now be read that the planned bridge is no longer part of the road construction project for cost reasons.
The idea of the SP Kreis 3, instead of a new bike bridge, to widen the existing pedestrian bridge along the Szu-tracks for bicycle traffic and to create a level crossing with barriers at the Giesshübel train station was not taken into account in the project.Bicycle travelers who want to go to the city from Eichstrasse via the Sihluferweg can use the underpass according to the report to cross the tracks.construction of the bridge
However, the bike route continues to be put pressure at the earliest in 2018.A corresponding postulate is pending in the local council.According to the parliamentary service, the initiative will probably be declared at the end of May.
The head of the civil engineering and disposal department, Ruth Genner, has agreed to accept the postulate for the exam on behalf of the city council.The SVP parliamentary group requests rejection.Regardless of the outcome of the debate in the city parliament, it is already clear that the project of a pedestrian and bike driver bridge over the Manessestrasse and the Sihl is not quite off the table.
«This connection is provided in the execution plan.According to today's planning status, the pedestrian and cyclist bridge is expected to be realized in 2018, »assures Stefan Hackh, the spokesman for the civil engineering office.However, the planned transition is to be built on one side beyond the tracks.
Anyone who comes from the Friesenberg must use the underpass anyway.The bridge runs from the Giesshübel Szu train station parallel to the existing railway bridge over the Manessestrasse.
From there the bridge is then built at the right angle to the Sihl over the river.The situation will remain unsatisfactory for the cyclists in the next five years.According to the traffic rules that are applicable today, you have to switch to Bederstrasse or drive over the Manesseplace.
Improvement In the visual this, the delay in the construction of the bike bridge is not compatible with the goals of the Velo master plan, HackH does not want to accept.«The city does a lot to promote bicycle traffic.However, not everything desirable can be realized overnight.»
Apart from that, an improvement will soon be improved for cyclists.The underpass of the SZU-tracks along the Manessestrasse for foot and bicycle traffic will be widened.«Between 2015 and 2017, both Uetliberg and Manessestrasse will receive bike paths on both sides with a width of 1.5 meters.

City -style test bicycles / / From May, the city of Zurich will try out two new, automatic bicycle rental stations on Beatenplatz.From Denise Marquardzürich - On the Beatenplatz near the train station, two new rental bike rental systems will soon be tested.
One of them is called public.It works with a solid holder, to which the loano is docked and triggered with a chip card.The principle will be familiar with who has been in Paris in recent years.
The other system is called Velospot.It is already in operation in western Switzerland, does not need docks and is therefore cheaper.The bicycles have an electronic frame lock that can be opened using the card, similar to the system for mobility cars.
"Velospot also does without larger buildings and is flexible," says Urs Walter from the civil engineering office of the city of Zurich.The question of how properly the users put the bikes back after use is still open.The city cost the two bike stations with bicycles and EDP CHF 10,000.
Both systems are now being tested extensively, with six bicycles each.The public is two of them e-bikes.The civil engineering office considers the automatic bicycle rental as a supplement to public transport, but only for short distances.
Therefore, the first half hour is free.After that, every further hour costs two francs for a bike, four francs for an e-bike.The attempt remains limited to the station on Beatenplatz.
Because there are the city's officials there, the city primarily wants to address its own employees as subjects during the test phase and the existing customers of the two bike stations.The experiences gained are evaluated and taken into account in the further planning. "In the city of Zurich, we would need at least 1000 bicycles," says Urs Walter.And where should all the stations be set up?
"In a small -scale city like Zurich, this is a big challenge," says Walter.It must be mastered.Because the city council wants a bicycle loan system for the city of Zurich.

Right-links comes well / / Wankdorfplatz ·
Rules that take some getting used to on Wankdorfplatz apply to cyclists.Bending left, for example, is only allowed indirectly.Yesterday Pro Velo Bern showed how it can be cycled across the square.
Every day, 65,000 vehicles drive across Wankdorfplatz, and many unintentionally do something wrong.It seems as if overcoming the square is a matter of luck, especially the first time.Half a year after the opening of the new square, Pro Velo Bern informed Velo -Driving for the second time on the regime for the second time.
The canton has already carried out the same action, the TCS has advertised courses for drivers.There is almost like a roundabout "Many bike travelers do not yet know how to drive over Wankdorfplatz," says Thomas Schneeberger, Commissioner for Velom measures at Pro Velo.He thinks above all of those who put the bike in the basement over winter.
"In particular, the turning of the left takes some getting used to," he adds.Only indirectly turning on the left on Wankdorfplatz.If you want to left, you have to go on right.
So no crossing of straight traffic is necessary, but it can happen that you have to wait for two traffic lights."But even then it takes less long than on the old Wankdorfplatz," says Schneeberger.The safest thing was implemented by all possible solutions.
However, he sees opportunities for improvement in the signaling: «Anyone who perceives the place as a roundabout does not come to the signs that indicate the turning turn.»After interventions by his association, the arrows that show left before the indirect junction were already being painted over.
"These arrows were factually wrong," said Schneeberger.The high walls are also dangerous because they blocked the view.Police granted “grace period”
Because the police also see the difficulties that the road users face on Wankdorfplatz, they will “initially mark preventive presence in the coming months”, as a spokeswoman says.A new traffic routing of this kind needs "a period of time".After this “grace period”, however, real controls would be carried out and false cyclists were lost.
David Stampfli, the President of Pro Velo Bern, sees an example on Wankdorfplatz that bike travelers in Bern do not make progress as desired."If you have to wait all the time, this keeps people from cycling," he criticizes.The SP city council therefore wants to continue to work for a “green wave” for bicycles on main traffic axes.

Better routes for Velos / / SCF.· Construction sites are unpopular.
Not only drivers or pedestrians are annoyed by the resulting detours, they are also a hindrance for cyclists.In addition, diversions for cycle paths in the past have either been completely forgotten or not satisfactorily implemented, as Zurich City Councilor Daniel Leupi stated at a media conference on Tuesday.In order to ensure security for bike drivers at construction sites, the municipal service department traffic launched a project a year ago. "What we have to do is unique in Switzerland," said Leupi.
It is planned to maintain existing bike routes on construction sites if possible.If this is not feasible, a good alternative should be offered.In addition, one wants to signal and understandably signal diversions, and the driving area within a construction site should become more comfortable and safer.
"I am convinced that the improvements meet the wishes of the bikers," said Leupi.But he admitted that correct signaling was not always possible - especially when construction sites change.It could happen that the redesign of the diversions cannot be fulfilled.
In such cases, it is recommended to get off the bike to push it past the construction site as a pedestrian.The “Masterplan Velo” project also stipulates to pay attention to the detour of bicycle traffic when planning a construction project.The bypass of a construction site should also be clearly and understandably signaled.
For this reason, the traffic department has developed new signposts for Velos that have been used since last March.The first results of the current test phase are promising.From April 2014, a concrete and binding instructions should come into force after the test phase evaluating the test phase, which regulates the bicycle lines on construction sites.
Inadequate bypasses for bicycles in the past have led to a "certain game growth culture" in the driving behavior of some cyclists, said Leupi.The new signaling, on the other hand, shows the bicycles that they had been thought of and that they no longer have to organize themselves.A construction site no longer provides an argument for illegal driving behavior.

At the suggestion of IG Velo Thun, the Spiez interest group was founded in 1993, Gerhard Schafroth recalled in the attic room of the Spiez hospital, newly consecrated to demolition.The IG was renamed the Pro Velo Region Spiez in 2008, and its end seemed to be laid down in 2010.After the rescue at the last minute, the tasks of traffic safety were continued unchanged.
This also applies in the club year 2012, which according to President Jürg Wittwer had a positive statement on the redesign project “Let’ s Swing ”on Oberlandstrasse.Furthermore, Pro Velo asked questions about the development of the planned new Landi building in the Angalder.Wittwer mentioned the promised adaptation of the national velor route in the Eyfeld in Wimmis during and after the upcoming fill.
The successful bicycle campaign in November is also offered this year.According to cashier Andreas Wittwer, the campaign made a practically balanced bill.Therefore, the annual fee of CHF 30 for individual members and CHF 40 for families - including subscription to the magazine "Pro Velo" and the new ID cards for members with reductions in specialist purchases.

In addition, the “Velovision 2020” is intended to promote traffic safety and should be deepened with the conversations with authorities, parents and schools.«Why did the old göppel of the bike tour have been on the scrap site instead of the bike?“An outraged member wanted to know.The board also promised to investigate this question.

New York rises to the bike around / / recently New York has also been one of the cities with a large -scale loan system.It comprises 6000 bicycles and 330 docking stations.
Experience from Paris flowed in the program.Niklaus Nuspliger, New Yorkbarcelona, London, Paris or Washington-the list of cities with a bike sharing program has been long in recent years.Since last week, New York has also been one of the metropolises in which you can borrow a bike for short trips and after 45 minutes at another station in the city.
In Manhattan and Brooklyn, 6000 bicycles are available at 330 stations - in the medium term, the program should consist of 10,000 bicycles at 600 stations.The citi-bikes named after the main sponsor Citibank can be used unlimited for $ 95 a year, but tourists are also available for a day or a week.New York would not be New York if the introduction of the blue bicycles that noticeably change the cityscape would have passed the stage without discounts.
The start of the program had to be postponed several times due to technical problems and the vertebral storm “Sandy”.But when the bike stations were finally installed in the past few weeks, the New Yorkers surpassed themselves with whining and complaints.According to surveys, a majority of the population welcomes the program, but you prefer not to have the bulky docking stations in front of your own house.
Drivers also resisted the loss of parking spaces on the grounds that they were here in New York and not in the Velostadt Copenhagen.Still others complained that the bike served as a moving advertising medium for the hated Grossbank Citibank, whose logo is oversized on the bicycles.So far, the citi-bikes seem to be unelegant and a sword.
The bicycles are robust, fairly unbelievable and a good 20 kilograms, which is why you don't fly through the streets very quickly.For this purpose, the three-speed vehicles with their nitrogen-filled tires in aggressive New York traffic should also be able to withstand a lot.The choice of bicycles was based on the stable models of the program in London.
Overall, New York was more of a model in Paris as a model, since the Seine-Stadt had the greatest similarities to New York in terms of population density, tourism and the lively underground railway.In Paris, after the start of the 2009 program, it was quickly found that bike drivers were happy to travel downhill, but that hardly anyone turned the bicycles back in the higher docking stations.As in Paris, therefore in New York vans are now used, which the bicycles are constantly spreading to the stations evenly.
In Paris, after countless bike thiefs, the anchoring of the bicycles in the wards had to be improved - which has now also been done in New York.Based on experience from Melbourne, the introduction of a heligm league has also not been introduced in order not to deter casual users.The efforts of a more environmentally friendly city are not harmless to the new bike sharing system.
A total of new bike strips were created at a distance of 560 kilometers under the aegis of Mayor Bloomberg.These have triggered bitter beliefs, but the number of bike enders has increased.Nevertheless, it is open how strongly and sustainably the American traffic habits can be changed, especially since cycling in New York is still not harmless.
But Michael Bloomberg is convinced that the rental wheel system will sustainably strengthen the trend towards "healthy and environmentally friendly commuting".In any case, the plans are ambitious: If the offer is expanded, as is currently the case, the financial metropolis on the American east coast will run the world's third largest bike sharing program soon after the Chinese city of Hangzhou with 60,000 and Paris with 20,000 bicycles.Neither harmless nor without controversy: the bike sharing program in New York.

Traffic lights should be based on the bike rhythm / / / Velo-Transport · The city parliament wants the municipal council to check a green wave and double-storey parking spaces for Velos.
With two advances that were discussed in the city council yesterday, the GB / JA faction requires improvements for cyclists.The fact that bike in Bern is stagnating, while the use of public transport continues to increase: Bern is not yet an attractive Velostadt.
While it is possible in Copenhagen to drive through the whole city at 20 without a stop, be it hardly possible in Bern to reach two and more consecutive traffic lights at green with the bike.The municipal council should therefore check whether and where in Bern the green wave on main traffic axes can be adjusted to a bicycle -compatible rhythm, an initiative demands.While the SVP parliamentary group was the only one against the advance, the government, according to the municipal councilor Ursula Wyss (SP), finds it "sensible to check whether the potential of bicycle traffic can be better exhausted".
With 46 yes against 14 no votes with 3 abstentions, the concern was a clear majority.The demand for double -story bicycle places around the train station was even more accepted.Here, too, the criticism from the SVP faction was not heard.

With the bike through the narrow Rämistrasse / / between the peacock and the Bellevue, the city plans a bicycle strip.By Jürg Rohrer
Zurich - For one of the biggest bicycle problems and one of the narrowest needle tubes in Zurich, a solution is surprisingly emerging: a bike connection between home square and Bellevue.The busy Rämistrasse is so narrow that a bicycle path for the city council has never been considered.
But now the civil engineering office under Ruth Genner (Greens) is serious.The project has been publicly available for the participation procedure since Friday: www.stadt-zuerich.ch/planzlagen. A continuous wheel strip is provided.
In order to make room for this, the bushes, concrete discounts and the wall are removed in the upper part of the Rämistrasse at Kunsthaus and the masts are restored.The sidewalk is nibbled below the deer grave until it is only 1.4 meters wide over a length of 20 meters in front of Waldmannstrasse.After the curve, the sidewalk measures 2.5 meters again.
The road for the cars remains the same, as the Cobra trams only drive past trucks and travel cars at a distance of centimeters.The Veloweg leads uphill over the eastern side of the sidewalk, which is already practiced today, but is actually prohibited.The participation procedure lasts until July 22.
If you always want, you can make objections.Although these are not binding, the rejections must be justified by the city engineer.This is followed by the public edition of the construction project, against which recurs can be submitted.
The bike route through Rämistrasse is entered in the regional structure plan;The canton or the Office for Transport has already approved the project.The civil engineering office hopes to be able to start building in autumn 2014 and to inaugurate the bike strip that was once considered impossible three months later.

200 million francs for the bike are even too much for the city council / / The civil engineering office has reacted to the bike initiative of the young Greens.With a counter -proposal in which the canton participates in the costs.
By Jürg Rohrerzürich - “Züri away” is the name of the service of the Zurich city administration in the colors Blau -Weiss, made by the Swiss company Simpel.It is a low -maintenance everyday bike with seven gears, thick tires, a basket, and the light automatically switches on in the dark.This service has too little breed for the young Greens.
They want to be more comfortable and more comfortable.For this purpose, they launched the popular initiative “for safe and consistent bike routes” last autumn.It demands a framework loan of CHF 200 million for the planning and construction of a nationwide and secure bike route network, created within 20 years.
The new bike routes are to be largely built on the street, so that the cyclists no longer have to switch to the sidewalk.The goal is to make bicycle traffic safer and more attractive, reduce the number of accidents and to improve air quality.Just
6 percent of all paths are covered with the bike in Zurich, the young Greens are justified, but in Winterthur there are 13 percent in Basel.It also needs to be placed by the Velo initiative to support the support of SP, Greens, Green Liberals, Juso, VCS, Pro Velo and by traffic.On January 30th it was submitted with 4,500 signatures.
Now the city council confirms the validity of the initiative.It is in line with his mobility strategy, he writes, and a framework loan is also a suitable instrument.Nevertheless, the city council does not fit the popular initiative because a large part of the planned bicycle routes in the structure plan is classified regionally.
«Their implementation is thus financed by the canton.The amount of the loan therefore appears too high for the purpose formulated in the initiative. »Furthermore, the city council criticizes that not only a comprehensive route network is needed for bicycle funding, but also storage spaces and bike stations.Depending on the location, the construction of such systems is expensive.
In the regional executive plan, additional bike parking spaces are drawn at the main train station and at the stations stadium stadium, Tiefenbrunnen, Wollishofen, narrow, Wiedikon and Oerlikon.In order not to have to pay for the financing of the regional bike routes and systems alone as required by the popular initiative, the city council commissioned the head of the civil engineering and disposal department, Ruth Genner (Greens), to develop a counter -proposal.It is also said to contain a framework loan, which, in addition to the routes, also enables parking facilities and which takes into account the financial skills of the city and the canton. 16 months, the city has time for this counter -proposal.
On May 30, 2014, he must be available at the latest and will then be submitted to the local council together with the popular initiative.
The initiative committee has not yet discussed what the initiators think of the city council's procedure and whether the initiative is withdrawn in favor of the counter -proposal at best.In any case, this decision depends on the formulated counter -proposal.As with the situation similar to the city initiative, there were partly the same arguments and actors two years ago.
The popular initiative “To promote public transport, foot and bike traffic in the city of Zurich”, better known as the city initiative, was in principle welcomed by the city council, but was rejected due to strict deadlines and specifications and provided with a counter-proposal.The municipal council was both good, the people in the vote of September 2011 too.When the stab question then, the initiative for the horror of the city council was extremely thin in front of the counter -proposal.
Since then, the city has to try to reduce the proportion of car traffic in total traffic by ten percentage points within ten years, which is considered impossible with its own resources - without the support of the federal and canton.In any case, City President Corine Mauch (SP) and Ruth Genner recently expressed themselves in front of the media when they presented their program in 2025.This also includes measures from the urban bike program from last year, with which bike transport is to be doubled by 2025.
For this, the city council expects around CHF 55 million, an average of CHF 4 to 5 million a year, of which the canton should take over more than half due to the regional routes.For comparison: the bike initiative demands around CHF 10 million a year for planning and building new bike paths.The new bicycle paths are to be built on the street so that the bicycles do not have to switch to the sidewalk.
One goal of the initiative is to make cycling in Zurich safer and thus more attractive.Photo: Steffen Schmidt (Keystone) Where are Zurich's bicycle traps?
Online survey of the velo paths ending on the tapestone, treacherous tram rails, dangerous construction sites, confusing intersections: cycling in the city of Zurich can be risky.An action by the young Greens is currently reminiscent of this.
They have set up Weisse Velos in 16 places in the city, which are decorated with flowers and grave candles (TA from July 18).The white bicycles mark places where, according to the young Greens, more than ten accidents with bike occurred last year.The “Tages-Anzeiger” expands the search for the most dangerous places in the city of Zurich.
In the next few days, our readers can tell us online where their views are the largest bicycle traps and where they are already an accident by bike.And you can say how satisfied you are with the situation for cyclists in Zurich - regarding safety, marked paths and storage options for bicycles.The most dangerous areas are marked with a description of the problems and accidents on an interactive card that can also be found online.
(GG) Facebook instead of saddle measures against Velomüdigkeit under teenage study says: Young people prefer to drive the tram for convenience than with the bike.The city gives countermeasures with early biking.
By Peter Aeschlimannzürich - Whether in Paris, London or Zurich: cities that burst at the seams rely on the bike."A constantly growing volume of traffic can only be managed with means of transport that take up less space," says Mike Sgier, spokesman for the civil engineering department.But there is a problem.
The bike lobby is based on the youngsters, writes the “NZZ on Sunday” in its latest edition.In the past 20 years, bike use in children and adolescents has halved.A semi -finished Basel study comes to the conclusion that the offspring switch to public transport because they are more convenient.
"Young people can write SMS in the tram or bus, open their Facebook account and talk to each other," writes the newspaper.You don't know whether Zurich teenagers actually prefer their cell phone to the bike base."We didn't ask her that," says Mike Sgier.
However, the city is very well aware that the youngsters must be encouraged.This is exactly why the Velo master plan is available.Numerous measures are already working.
The number of participants in the bike exams has increased since these no longer take place on Saturdays, but on Wednesday afternoons.For the little ones, for example, the city sets the pump track for wheels in the bike park on the Allmend.And in the future, the inexperienced comfort routes will make it easier for so -called comfort routes.
Sales stable here is the real problem: Many Zurich bike owners are simply afraid of asserting themselves on the densely used streets.When the Danish Velobe representative recently completed a bike tour through Zurich, his verdict was sobering: «This is piecemeal.
There does not seem to be a comprehensive bike strategy here.»Zurich is in the back for light years, which affects bike friendliness.So maybe not the trams or even the young people are too comfortable, but too uncomfortable.
The “NZZ on Sunday” also wants to read a proof that bicycles are no longer considered cool.Mike Sgier doesn't trust him.It was true that in 2012 there was no good year for the paragraph of leisure and everyday bike, since 2007 the numbers have been stable over all bicycle strings.
Anyway, Zurichers are increasingly traveling with racing bike, mountain or electrobics.The two -wheelers that were bought abroad over the Internet were also missing in statistics.In its article, the “NZZ am Sonntag” proposes to restrict public transport to promote bicycle traffic.
Finally, tram and bus- together with the foot traffic, made two thirds of the overall traffic in Swiss cities.The city rejects this proposal."Of course we want more bike traffic, but not at all costs," says Sgier.

TRAMTUNNEL under the Burgern target?/ / Veloverkehr · Bern wants to double the bike content on traffic.
In order to improve the situation for cyclists, experts from the city have exchanged dutial bicycle experts. "The Bernese rely too much on the ground," says Dutch Velobodassier Tom Godefrooij.On Monday he drove through the city of Bern with the bike and examined the neuralgic points in the Bernese bike traffic network together with urban traffic experts."The bike tracks have to be marked more clearly and more direct, leading over less detours," is the conclusion Godefrooijs.
Even if the city will not implement the knowledge of the conference immediately, they teach them, says traffic planner Hugo Staub: “The workshop asks us to discuss cheeky and more radical solutions in favor of bike drivers.»Specifically, this means in many places in the transport network:
For cyclists, more space has to be created, tram rails and car parking spaces would have to be moved at a duly distance."At the Burgernziel accident focus, the Dutch even propose a two -level solution in which the trams would be led under the floor in a roundabout." Fear of the Velo in Bern for the city of Bern, the construction director Ursula Wyss (SP), the findings show the way for improved planning.«We have to think better for cyclists from the start when planning traffic planning.»
According to Wyss, Bern also has potential for improvement in the infrastructure: «With clearer markings, wider traces and bike places with straps, more people would certainly drive in the city of Bern Velo.»And the city has set itself the goal for the legislature 2013-2016: to double the proportion of cyclists in the city from 11 to 22 percent.
"We know that many would like to drive bike in Bern, but not dare because they find the streets too little." Don't be afraid in HollandThe Dutch suggestions are valuable support to go in the right direction."It doesn't have to be a communication line right away," says Wyss with a smile and alluding to the two-meter-wide Dutch bike strips on which the bicycles can drive next to each other and talk together.Incidentally, the Dutch velobatabelter Tom Godefrooij never wears a helmet while cycling, not even on his tour through Bern: «Holland has the lowest bike rates, but also the deepest bike incorrect rate - we do not fuel the fear of cycling, but emphasize its health -promoting effect.»

Migrants should switch to the bike / / from Pauline Pfirterbasel.In the city it is now a good tone to be traveling with the bike, driving a car is almost frowned upon.
Basel is a Velostadt, the yellow bike strips are increasingly shaping the cityscape.Accordingly, the bike and the promotion of the Basel veloculture always play a role in the negotiations of the Great Council and the government.On Tuesday, the government council published a message about a suit from Sibel Arslan (green alliance) on the promotion of bike culture among migrants.
According to the government council, the concerns of Sibel Arslan are supported, but there is already a bundle of suitable measures.The government council therefore applied for the depreciation of the business.Inhibition threshold present
Arslan took up the topic because she as a green politician has an order towards bike funding.From a personal experience, she knows that migrants are increasingly switching to bike."But there is still a certain inhibition threshold," says Arslan.
For those migrants who have not grew up in Holland, the bike has a completely different meaning culturally than for Swiss.Velo paths are not as common everywhere as in Basel."I myself became great in a culture in which the idea prevails that bike is dangerous," says Sibel Arslan.
Exactly at this performance, Arslan wanted to start with her suit.The positive sides of cycling should be brought closer to the people who have grown without bike.On the one hand, the bike promotes health.
On the other hand, the bike is more efficient in the city center than the car.Arslan received feedback via her advance from different sides."Especially from people with a migration background who are traveling a lot with the bike, there was little understanding," says Arslan.
Nevertheless, it is of the opinion that it is important to bring even more people to the taste of the bike ride. "Today's offer is very good and diverse, but you can still pick up more people," says Arslan.It is precisely this already existing, diverse offer for children and adults, Swiss and migrants, was decisive for the government to apply for the Grand Council to declare Arslan's suit as done.Courses for adults and children's canton
Basel-Stadt, for example, pays CHF 120,000 to the Gsünder Basel association every year, which, among other things, also offers special bicycle courses for migrants together with the Pro Velo association.The courses last to five days and depending on the personal level, adult driving technology and traffic safety are taught.The offer for children in the school -based offer is also extremely extensive.
In primary school it begins with bike lessons from second class, followed by lessons in the traffic garden.The orientation school conducts traffic safety days across the board.In this way, students in their residential quarters are brought closer to safety on the street.
Road safety as problem investigations by the youth, family and sport of the educational department have found a general new trend."According to our experience, driving ability is no longer the main problem," says Hansjörg Lüking, head of the youth, family and sport department.The driving ability of today's youth, regardless of their nationality, are trained early on by equilibrium exercises on the playground or the playground.
Trottinette, which are widespread today, are good equilibrium training for children, without there being there.Parents bring their children to school more and more by car, which gives the children a chance to practice in traffic."For many parents, cycling was also part of everyday life in their youth, but at that time there was much less traffic," says Lüking.
The fear of parents about their children in road traffic is not a question of national origin.Those who have generally grew up without reference to the bicycle cannot teach their children the meaning and rules of cycling.At the same time, there is more and more traffic in the city;

Difficult bite parking / / from Nadine A. Brüggerbasel.
Basel likes to see himself as a bicycle city.One of the most important questions for cyclists is still insufficiently clear: where to go by bike when you don't sit on it?
The bicycle situation is unclear in Basel.This year 1649 Velos had been drawn in due to false parking.First and foremost, the bikes belong to the marked bicycle places.
"In my personal opinion, there is not enough of it in the city center," says Pro-Velo President David Wüest-Rudin, "these places are overcrowded at rush times, so the bike is put off and thus risks a bus".How and where can you legally park wildly in such cases?Police decide before Ortauf the sidewalk, for example, the wheel may be parked if a width of 1.5 meters remains free for the pedestrians.
But what happens when the bicycles tip over or piling up and the 1.5 meters are not kept with it?"In this case, the police decide whether the bikes are bothered," said Andreas Knuchel from the cantonal police.In streets without a sidewalk and marked fields, bicycles can also be put directly on the road - as long as they do not disturb.
The police also decide exactly when a bike is bothering.In doing so, she is "reserved and decides with a mass of eyes". "As long as it is not hindered, the bike may also be parked in the park," adds Martin Weibel from the building department.But when does a bike hinder?
Bicycles are cleared away if “is violated against a concrete ban, or there is a disability or hazard,” explains Knuchel the criteria of the bike collectors.The concrete bans can be found under Article 19 of the Transport Regulation Ordinance and correspond to those for cars.As the main problem in bike parking, Velo lobbyist Wüest-Rudin does not see the subjective assessment of the police officers, who are classified on site, which is "disturbing" and "not disturbing".
The main problem is fundamentally: «It does not always work optimally.An example of this is the planning of new bicycle spaces.»
While Wüest-Rudin pleads for more small, decentralized bicycle places, "so that you don't have to go long distances on foot, but actually come from door to door with the bike," explains Florian Mathys from the construction and traffic department: "Long-term goal is, it is,Rather larger systems and less decentralized bike storage areas ». This is more dependent on the regulation on the parking of bicycles than on humanity than on the rules, then explains Thomas Rohrbach from the Federal Office of Strasse as follows:« Velos can be easily removed or switched, that's why wrong parking is less tragic. »Buses and towing and towing and how do you get a bicycle that has been drawn in, back into your own bike?The bike in the armory can be picked up for a bus of CHF 20 and a towing fee of CHF 35.
But if you think that your bike has been illegally towed, you have not bothered at the place in question, you can recourse on an administrative right.It is questionable whether you will successfully move forward in this way, because what bothers and what doesn't are the subjective assessment of the administration.Wüest-Rudin appeals to the eye of the police officers and demands “more tolerance for cyclists.
You should only remove the wheels where it is essential ».Or those rules that are clearly determined communicate better.«More clarity would be desirable, but you can never completely solve that.

Two -wheelers for the Grossstadt / / Michael Baumann · The fact that Zurich is a bicycle city is not only not only noticed that politics promotes the two -wheeler by all means.
In the shadow of this orientation, a number of bicycle brands have emerged in the Limmat metropolis in recent years and have opened specialist shops.Both apply to the bike factory.Under this name, Richard Zimmerli produces and sells its two -wheelers on Stockerstrasse.
He only uses aluminum as material for the frames that he has produced in Taiwan according to his specifications.Powder -coated and injected, the frames in Switzerland and finally assembled into a bike in Zurich are assembled.Self -made bikes are also used.
The bicycle factory specializes in vehicles for the city.Around 85 percent of customers use such a bike.With the sporty model Cityocker, for example, which is available in different versions from a weight of 10.5 kilograms and at a price from CHF 1299, you are well equipped for Zurich's streets.
Zimmerli also builds up a mountain bike called Bergrocker from CHF 1499 on the same classic framework.You are more comfortable with the City scooter from CHF 1199.A racing bike should be added later.
The name or that of a company or a hotel adorns the framework for 70 francs.If the frame, color, equipment is selected, it takes two to three days for the bike to be picked up.
In addition to its own brand, Zimmerli also sells bicycles from Cannondale, clothing and diverse accessories.An important mainstay is the service of Velos of all brands.The opening times are entirely geared towards the big city:

Velokurier feels safer on the side of the streets than in Zurich / / Matt Saunders has founded the first bicycle service of the Arab world in Beirut.
He gained experience for this in Zurich.By Thomas Zempzürich - Traffic in Beirut is chaotic compared to Zurich: the cars are stowing all day long, there are hardly any traffic signals.
Red lights are more to decorate on the side of the street than they regulate traffic.And there are no bike paths.Nevertheless, Velokurier Matt Saunders feels safer on side streets than in traffic in Zurich.
The reason: «The drivers in Beirut drive more carefully because the traffic is much less regulated.“They showed respect for the few bikers on the street.In Zurich, the automotiveists mostly only looked at the right that the traffic rules grant them, and hardly even at other road users, whether pedestrians, cyclists or drivers.
In the six months in which Saunders are on the road as a bicycle, he was never approached by a car.In Zurich, the average of twice passed him per half of the year.For three years, the Englishman Matt Saunders curved through the Zurich streets as a bicycle and delivered fruit and vegetables for the Öpfelchasper and Sushi for a Japanese restaurant.
Love had lured him to Zurich: when he studied Arabic in the Syrian Damascus, he had met a Zurich woman;The Englishman followed his love into Switzerland.
As an enthusiastic cyclist who was cycling from his home to Morocco by bike, he soon found himself looking for work in the saddle for the courier service of the Öfelchasper.It was clear that Saunders and his girlfriend wanted to go back to the Arab world.However, Damascus was no longer an option, because the civil war had broken out in Syria.
They opted for Beirut, although Matt Saunders had never been there before.In the Lebanese capital, he quickly recognized: “Come on in traffic is almost impossible here.»
Except, you sit on the bike and use the narrow streets between the thawed cars and sometimes drive on the sidewalk.It was therefore obvious for Saunders.So he was looking for a partner in the city and found him in the person of the local Karim Sokhn, who has been organizing night excursions across the city for bicycles for years.
Up to 100 people take part today.Saunders and Sokhn successfully collected money through a crowdfunding project.And started with the first bike cubes in the Arab world last September.
They call him degri messengers;Degri means “straight ahead”. Subsiders sit down on the bike for the courier service of Matt Sauders.One makes a living entirely with this work.
Five more help - as a graphic artist or webmaster.The crew quadrupled the sales from $ 300 in the first month to $ 1200 in February.Customers are non -governmental organizations, educational institutions, insurance, translators.
They also include the Swiss embassy and the Office of the Swiss Directorate for Development and Cooperation.The vehicle causes a sensation in the middle of noise.With the new service, the bicycles quickly made it into the media.
The largest television station in Lebanon brought a report on the agile couriers on their bike.Everywhere in Beirut, Saunders and his couriers do not deliver: in a quarter in Beirut, there are always battles and suicide attacks.
"We do not accept any orders from this dangerous quarters," says Saunders.In a non -governmental organization, he also informs himself how security in Beirut develops."We are not afraid of attacks, but we are careful," he says.
Matt Saunders says that he and his couriers are not faster than the motorcycle couriers who have existed in Beirut for a long time.«However, customers realize that we are reliable.We never lose a show, we are punctual and decent.»
Environmental perspective considerations hardly played a role in orders.But Saunders is the environmental protection in the city with the exhaust gas -pested air.He sees himself and his couriers as an ambassador for cycling.
Although Lebanese would like to curve around with their mountain bikes in the mountains on weekends, it is not yet used often as a ride of everyday life to commute.Now he is organizing a bicycle festival with his bike service, the cycling circle of his business partner Karim Sokhn and the Danish embassy in Beirut.Company founder Matt Saunders (right) in the Lebanese capital Beirut.

Vespa-mafia instead of Velo-Filz / / The confessing Vespa driver Filippo Leutenegger replaces the bicycle traveling Ruth Genner as a city council responsible for traffic (NZZ 24. 14)-this rumor has seduced me to dream.The solution for Zurichs
Transport and parking problems are tangible!“Vespa Parking only” on at least half a parking area in public space, of course free travel for buzzing two-wheelers on all trams and bus traces, and in principle is permitted.If a traffic light is at red at a crossing, the only indication of the “vespers”, which are flashing over it, is a little more closely taken to take a look so as not to risk a dent on the good piece.
This allows us to finally put an end to the excesses of the Genner Velo felt.If the Vespa mafia continues to nestle in our Mediterranean city, Pate Filippo can also ensure that all local signs become bilingual: "Zurich-Zurigo", and in the sense of a pronouncing public private sponsorship, they are provided with the adjoining cities with the addition: "Sponsored by Piaggio" .eric Kuster, Zurich

But there are also critical voices, even on the unexpected side.Zurich is to become a bike city.This is clear at the latest since the motion of André Odermatt (Sp.) And Daniel Leupi (Gp.) Was transferred to the municipal council two years ago - at that time the two city councils were still in parliament - which demands a continuous network of bicycle routes in the city.
A lot has happened since then.Among other things, the city council presented the “Masterplan Velo”, which is supposed to double bike traffic and should close gaps in the route network.Initiative of the young Grünendie Junge Greens wanted to give the matter additional boost and launched a “bike initiative” in early 2013, with which they demanded a framework of CHF 200 million for planning and building a nationwide bicycle network in the city of Zurich.
Only a few hours before the motion of Odermatt and Leupi was to be written off in the local council on Wednesday evening without a vote against, the city council announced that it rejected the initiative of the young Greens, but generally find the right to find correctly.The executive therefore contrasts the initiative a counter -proposal.According to the city council's ideas, the framework loan should not be CHF 200 million, but CHF 120 million.
In addition, instead of only for the construction of bike routes, the money should also be spent on the creation of bike stations and parking spaces.For the latter, the city plans to spend CHF 30 million over the next 20 years.Around CHF 40 million will flow into projects that have already been planned over the next 10 years and to optimize existing municipal cycling routes.
Around 50 million francs are to be reserved for the implementation of the municipal teaching plan in 10 to 20 years.This results in the CHF 120 million, which the city council submits in its counter -proposal.The framework loan should also be explicitly reserved for purely municipal bike routes.
Sectional bicycle lines on urban soil are to continue to be financed through the construction and maintenance flat rate of the canton.With the framework loan, the city council would have relatively free hand, which projects it would implement to promote bicycle traffic.If the counter -proposal is accepted, the city -key executive is also committed to reporting to the local council annually as to which concrete measures should be financed from the framework loan in the next three years.
The initiative and the counter -proposal are submitted to the voters at the same time.An appointment for this is not yet clear.First of all, the local council will deal with it.
Not forgetting drivers Wednesday, however, the counter-proposal to the “Velo Initiative” was not yet an issue in the local council.Instead, one leaned over the motion of Odermatt and Leupi one last time, which had got everything rolling.It was clear to the parliament that the city council with the "Master Plan Velo" and the "Traffic Concept Downtown" had long since taken the direction that the motion demanded.
There was still critical voices, for example from the SVP.It can hardly be pointed out that the city council unilaterally promotes certain road users while it is disabled, said Kurt Hüssy.«The city council is praising money to harass drivers.»
He forget that the traders also benefited from the accessibility with motorized traffic.The SVP is disappointed with the policy of the city council and will only take note of the motion.There was also quiet criticism of the Greens, albeit from the opposite motives.
Markus Knauss was fundamentally pleased with the commitment of the city for bicycle traffic, but the concrete projects sometimes left something to be desired.So there was no bike track when redesigning the home.You absolutely have to rethink that again.
However, Knauss did not let it yet and appealed to the city council's sense of responsibility.He should carefully consider who he wants to determine Ruth Genner's successor in the civil engineering and disposal department.Anyone who takes over this office must also be willing to implement the bike strategy.
Knauss did not give any names, but it alluded to the rumor that FDP man Filippo Leutenegger should follow Ruth Genner.From the meeting of the Zurich municipal council (JHU) & GT;City councils adopted the head of the social department Martin Waser (sp.) And the head of the civil engineering and disposal department Ruth Genner (Gp.) Are adopted in the municipal council. & GT;

New plans for Veloweg / / Heimberg · The Veloro route via the Aare and the highway should be lifted and at the same time brought closer to the Aare.
As part of the participation, the local council of Heimberg supports the revision of the Velo -Transport Subject Plan of the Canton of Bern.In addition to motorized private transport and public transport, the plan is intended to develop the bike as an independent means of transport with systematic network structure.In everyday traffic, Heimberg is affected by the Uetendorf connection towards Bernstrasse and in the Kiesen - Heimberg - Steffisburg connection. «When it comes to leisure traffic, the Veloroute via Aare and Aare on the height of Sportzentrum CIS is planned and again in the direction of Steffisburg to the Aare, namelyto lead to the existing river path, »said the community.

Canton launches Veloguide / / Lyss ·
The canton of Bern is setting up a pilot project in the Seeland: The “Veloguide Lyss and the surrounding area” shows what has been improved for cyclists in recent years.Lyss is a good example for the canton of Bern.
And for how the community continuously improves its Velonetz for leisure and everyday traffic, makes it more attractive and safer.Eight surrounding communities have also raised a lot of money for cyclists in recent years.Reason for the canton to locate its latest pilot project in the Seeland: the "Veloguide Lyss and the surrounding area".
"Many bicycle measures are realized in the canton of Bern, which are not even known to the population," says Peter Lerch, head of the planning and traffic area in the service center of the cantonal civil engineering office.The new Veloguide is supposed to change that: In the pocket format, the bike card offers an overview of the most important “improvements for bike”, which have been implemented from 2005 to 2014 or are still planned.
Lyss is on one side of the card, on the other hand the other communities are visible: Aarberg, Büetigen, Grossaffoltern, Jens, Kappelen, Seedorf, Studen and Worben.Situation considerable
A total of 18 so -called soft bicycle measures are listed in the guide.Among them the bike path from Lyss to Aarberg, the new bike station at Studen station or the traffic calming on Länggasse to Busswil."I cannot highlight a highlight," said Lerch, "that would not be fair.»
It is a total package of measures that have significantly improved the situation.Several million francs have flowed into this attractive manner in recent years."Of course, these measures mostly serve overall traffic, not just bike transport," says Lerch.
The goal of the Veloguides is clear: make it visible what the canton and communities do for the cyclists.And so in the long term attract more people to the saddles.In order to check whether the bike guide fulfills this purpose, well -founded post -evaluation should take place.
If this is positive, the canton also wants to support such bike cards in other regions.The pilot project costs around CHF 25,000.The municipalities of this bear 20 percent, sponsors 15 percent, the canton the rest.
The Veloguide with a circulation of 20,000 copies is sent free of charge to all households of the communities involved.Simone Lippunerden

Bruderholzstrasse becomes safer for cyclists / / / Bottmingen.The route from Bottmingen to Münchenstein will soon become much safer for cyclists.
As the construction and traffic department announced on request, the new velor route via the Bruderholz should be released this month.The cyclists are newly diverted from the Kreisel Fiechthagstrasse and drive parallel to the Bruderholzstrasse.The cost of the connecting piece and the measures on the roundabout amount to CHF 180,000.
There have been several fatal car accidents on Bruderholzstrasse in recent years.In the meantime, several political violations are pending, which demand that the street are made safer.However, the bike path was planned regardless of the current evaluation, according to the construction and environmental protection directorate.hys

The city of Bern tolerated false parked Velos / / BZ readers in April on our interactive traffic card entered their traffic difficulties.Today's last part of the series is about the Velochaos around Bern station.
On the left you get stuck on a bike with the shopping bag, on the right bicycles protrude into the sidewalk.In summer, pedestrians on the Schanzenstrasse at the wave only in the slalom course from A to B. The reason are the many incorrectly parked bicycles - for many readers one of the largest traffic malictresses in the city of Bern, as the interactive traffic map of the BZ showed.
For Peter Hirter, head of service at the cantonal police, the Bern train station is also one of the hotspots.That is why the police set a focus for slow traffic there last year.However, this focused primarily on moving traffic.
With the wrongly parked bicycles, the police only cleared away “specifically disturbing bicycles”.For example, when the bike had blocked passages and paths.An eye at the Bern train station The bicycles are illegally parked at hundreds, is known to those responsible for the city of Bern:
"The city deliberately does not want to set a main focus at the train station because there is currently a lack of bike parking spaces," says Peter Hirter from the cantonal police.The chaos at the Schanzenbrücke is not nice, but the bike is a welcome movement in Bern, says Hirter.Stefan Schwarz, General Secretary for Civil Engineering, Transport and Stadtgrün (TVS), confirms this non -advantage against illegally parked Velos:
"As long as we still have too little space, we think it is right if an eye is put on around the train station with incorrectly parked bicycles," he says.The city of Bern has too few parking spaces for cyclists around the train station.And finally it serves everyone if people lead to the bike and not by car to the train station - the space problems would otherwise be even greater, he says.
In 2016, around a thousand additional bicycle spaces are to be created at the new Post-PARC.This will certainly help in the west of the station, but in the east you also need a solution for the lack of parking space, says Schwarz.That's why the TVS directorate is looking for new offers.
The city is currently talking, for example with the SBB.Stefan Schwarz is convinced that this procedure is the right way for the current transition phase "with little repression and a lot of eyes".The cantonal police were more loose than the city with false parkers in dealing with moving Velorowdies.
Driving on the sidewalk, red or in the wrong direction of travel - for such and similar offenses, the police exhibited 942 order buses last year.And these numbers only refer to targeted controls.Compared to the previous year (430), this is more than doubling the bus money.
The reason: The police carried out twice as many targeted controls in 2013.In 2012 there were "only" 26 controls, their 59. Peter Hirter draws a positive balance for the past year: the controls were perceived by the population.
It is therefore important that there are further controls this year.Tobias Marti «At the moment we think it is right if an eye is put on around the train station.» Stefan Schwarz, Directorate TVSHOTSPOSS HONES TRACKS TO THE FOOD CAN
Bern train station remains a main focus for the cantonal police in the area of slow traffic.The focus is particularly on Bubenbergplatz, Christoffelgasse and the Spiebgasse.Because the situation is confusing, traffic controls are particularly complex there, says Peter Hirter.
That is why the police at the train station for traffic controls usually offer a larger number of police officers.The driving ban for the footpaths should be controlled more this year.Despite the ban, the paths are often used by bike drivers in summer.
In general, the police want to enforce driving bans.For example, that at the Federal Rain or that at the Schönusteg pedestrian bridge.The police don't just want to check at urban hotspots.

The Green General Mobiling / / With the “Master Plan Velo”, the city council wants to raise the population to bike drivers, from senior to migrant.But the last word about the state mobilization program has not yet been spoken.
We write the year 2025, Velo drives all of Zurich.Professor Lea Meyer Pedalt to the university, department head Luca Kraushaar in the office, the Ismaili family in Spreitenbach in the shopping center.Everyone is on the way, young, old, workers, intellectuals, thin and semi-slim.
There is no longer a thickness because everyone is bike.This is roughly how the red-green-dominated Zurich government is introducing itself to the city of the future.The number of bike rides is to be doubled by 2025, the “City Transport 2025” project wants to be doubled.
There is only a little problem: since 2000, the proportion of bicycle traffic on the entire traffic has stagnated 6 to 7 percent.This is despite the fact that individual city councils can be photographed on the bike at every opportunity and want to educate the population with "mobility campaigns" (NZZ, June 11, 14) to "city -friendly" (that is, car -free).
The solution to the city council for this problem is called “Masterplan Velo”. The perfect curb is the project at the suggestion of green bike lobbyists around Daniel Leupi (Gp.), Who is sitting in the city council today.At the beginning of the political process, the legitimate criticism was that there were too few and not too safe bicycle paths in the city.
However, the administration under the former civil engineer Ruth Genner (Gp.) Was not content with creating a few new ways.Rather, what the city council presented at the end of 2012 is a kind of general mobilization plan.The master plan, Genner said last autumn in the municipal council, would enable "to all people, regardless of age, gender or origin" to drive bike.
Genner's work is permeated by the belief that the state is capable of using a people of bike drivers.There are no people in the approximately 60-page master plan who basically do not want to drive bike.There are only people who do not drive due to fear, lack of training or because of bad ways.
In order to remedy such obstacles, the city has had the question clarified in a lasting attempt whether there is a perfect curb for non -motorized road users (knowledge: it does not exist; costs: CHF 110,000);
And for all inexperienced drivers, she has an extra -wide “comfort route” built, which has driven the estimated costs for the infrastructure to around CHF 55 million.The municipal council adopted the master plan at the end of 2013.Nevertheless, the ambitious work remains highly controversial to this day.
This is mainly due to the fact that the civil engineering office intends to delight the population with a huge animation and educational program (estimated costs: another CHF 12 million).Among other things, “tailor-made” courses for children, adults, parents, migrants, seniors and e-bike drivers, are planned in all quarters.Bicycles should be sensitized to everything, from the advantages of carrying helmets to the offered consideration in mountain biking to the problem of theft and “bicycle talent”.
As a reward, all the correct bicycles are waving a campaign that should reinforce "in their environmentally and health-conscious behavior".In October 2013, the FDP and Grünliberale tried to delete or at least halve the planned expenses of CHF 12 million.However, since the SVP rejects the master plan as a whole, it was not ready to offer hand for this compromise - and so it stayed with the attempt.
However, the last word has not yet been spoken.Because the municipal council has approved the master plan, but no framework loan, neither for the infrastructure nor for the so -called "soft measures". "Fighting for every rap" according to the civil engineering office (TED), every measure is budgeted, with the projects in the area in particularEducation has not yet been advanced.According to TED spokesman Mike Sgier, training is a pure “declaration of intent” for migrants.
This gives the opponents of state bike education hope."We will continue to fight these measures because they are indoctrinating and do not use anything," says FDP councilor Marc Bourgeois.«Zurich is and becomes not a bike city because it is not flat.»
The green -liberal parliamentary group leader Gian von Planta also expects that larger amounts can be reduced from the budget, unless they are divided and "hidden" by the administration.Planta is confident that the TED has recently been managed by Filippo Menschenegger (FDP.): «It is certainly not harmful that this change existed.»
In fact, the master plan for people is a difficult heir.Especially since he started to combat red-green transport policy.How he intends to deal with Genner's legacy does the FDP man only want to reveal in office after 100 days.
What is certain is that he should have a hard time against the majority of his SP and GP colleagues with any applications to flatten the master plan.And the bike lobby, which thanks to the master plan, waves orders for courses, wants to defend the "big throw" of the government by all means.In September 2013, the green municipal council and Pro-Velo board member Matthias Probst explained in the city parliament: «We are fighting for every rapping and square meter that is to be spent on this master plan.» Opinion & debate, page 20IM

"Seniors hardly dared to go to the sidewalk" / / by Markus Lehmannich recently asked the Federal Council a few questions about Velolittering and combating velorovytums.It is astonishing that I have consistently received positive feedback (including many bike), and the consent was even confirmed in the BAZ by survey, with an approval of 70 percent for reinforcing bike control signs.
In fact, it is a problem that manifests itself in all larger cities in Switzerland, be it with too few bicycle places as well as the lack of discipline from unfortunately many cyclists.If you look at the worries of senior citizens, the fear of being approached by bike drivers on the sidewalk is at the top of the list.Yes, you hardly dare to go to the sidewalk, from the justified fear of Velorowdys.
Of course, it is not the majority that is almost criminal with their bicycles in our city, but it is also more and more likely to find out that bicycles drive on the sidewalks with supporters, regardless of taking pedestrians.Pedestrian strips are also used more and more to force themselves to force themselves and to risk their heads and collars.Unfortunately, monitoring cameras in public space are repeatedly rejected by politics, which would be good support in the fight against crime, and a lot could also be contributed to calming and education in traffic.
Older readers are still remembering: When young people were caught on the motorcycle at a roll stop at a stop road by Willy Lutz, you had to go to the “penalty class” in the Spiegelhof on Wednesday afternoon.Perhaps bicycle cards would be a tried -and -tested means including a bicycle test in order to get more discipline in two -wheeled traffic again.Why can bicycles be placed on the market without bike racks, or in other words, why are bicycles not checked and then declared a driving comprehensive?
So that you can also act in line with bicycle and the required bike frastructure, you can discuss a bike fee.It would be more than fair if the users of additional infrastructure make a contribution and not only charge it to the general public.In many other areas, the costs are assigned to the cause principle and fees are collected.
Even a rainwater derivation fee was invented in Basel to burden the homeowners for the sewer that has existed for 100 years.So why should you not burden the exorbitant increase of bikes with full costs, which are caused by this?Additional expenses of the police by controls and towing, storage of bicycles as well as the construction of additional bicycle roads and bike houses should be able to be added.
Why are not additional bike parking spaces in the state parking garages - for payment - of course - is offered?This would also be a contribution to Velolittering, because the cityscape is a shame, a cultural city that wants to attract tourists, completely unworthy.Basically, I am against new fees, but since you can no longer get an existing one, it is indicated that it is seriously checked whether the costs can also be passed on in the event of bicycle traffic.

A dangerous mixture / / although bike is traveling much faster than pedestrians, you often have to share the sidewalk with them in Zurich.Both sides find that impossible, but the signalations don't make it better.
Marius Huberzurich - The city of Zurich has recently had a new means to make the life of the cyclists a little less dangerous: bucket of red special color.Thanks to a change in the law, the traffic department will paint the trace for cyclists in the coming months of forty, confusing branches in order to better draw attention to automobileists.The focus on such branches is logical because clashes between bicycles and cars often have bad consequences.
However, there is another category of problem areas where bicycle paths are often overlooked - which leads to less bad injuries, sometimes to do so: all places are meant to all those places where cyclists lead the cyclists through pedestrian areas.Paths that partly lead into nothing are the markings there so cautiously that the course of the Veloweg can only be guessed with a lot of flair.
On the Quai bridge, for example, the path coming from the Bürklipplatz ends suddenly in nothing or on the sidewalk in the crowd of the flaneers and tourists.Similar to the other side of the bridge, where a yellow arrow points directly into the rivet of the Riviera.No wonder, many pedestrians are often not even aware that they are on a velor route.
They therefore react similarly to the velo drivers who are crooked by the other way around, because the slalom course and the constant braking maneuvers get on his nerves.Both Zurich bicycle and pedestrian organizations have long been criticizing this type of mixing traffic.In the case of the municipal service department, there is no intention to defuse such problem areas with red -marked bicycle lanes.
The legal basis is missing, says Heiko Ciceri, the spokesman for the traffic department.In fact, the Federal Office of Street (Astra) expressly allows only on the road to color the surface red.There is no question of the sidewalk.
On the Staufflacherbrücke at the stock exchange, the city was nevertheless attempted with a red lane on the sidewalk.According to Ciceri, the result was crossed.It didn't harm it, but it didn't use much either.
Dave Durner from Pro Velo Zurich also has reservations.It has been shown that pedestrians did not shy away from entering red lanes marked red and sometimes even scolding when a cyclist ringed.Conversely, there would be fear that bike drivers would drive too quickly on such lanes and insist on their rights.
This was observed in the long -term underpass before the yellow lines were milled away.Disappointment about Masterplanwo It is essential to lead bikers through pedestrian areas, according to Durner, he would be more suitable for separating the two groups.Basically, the bike belongs to the street.
Unfortunately, the municipal civil engineering office note that far too little.This also applies to the latest planning, despite the promises of the Velo master plan, which was presented a year and a half ago.At the Stampfenbachstrasse, for example or on Winzerstrasse in Höngg, the city wants to run new bicycle paths across the sidewalk - protests, on the other hand, unmarried.
The civil engineering office argues that the unbundling of foot and bicycle traffic usually fails because there is too little space available.In some places, however, the situation will be defused in the foreseeable future.For example, after the upcoming renovation of the Quai bridge, it will be much more comfortable for cyclists to cross the Limmat there.

Basel's bicycles have what the Zürcher want / / After a pilot test, Basel is campaigning for cyclists to turn right even at red.In Zurich, the concern has a difficult stand.
Benjamin Hämmerlezurich - Basel converts what Zurich's bicycle bbyists fight for in a pilot test: since June 2013, bicycles have also been allowed to turn right at four different crossings in the city.Now the city's construction and traffic department has taken a balance sheet- and it is positive.
At the four intersections there were significantly fewer conflicts between bicycles and engine vehicles than before, the department said.The provisional regulation had encountered acceptance among the pedestrians;There were no accidents.
Drivers benefited in that no bicycles were delayed at Grüner Ampel.Now a change in the signaling regulation will be requested from the Federal Office of Street (Astra) so that the traffic regulation of the pilot test can be used permanently, the statement continues.Inactive
Stadtzürcher official Basel lead would have to be water on the mills of the Zurich bicycle bobby.
For years, bike -friendly politicians have been committed to ensuring that similar experiments are also carried out in the Limmatstadt.The municipal councils Matthias Probst (Greens) and Marcel Schönbächler (CVP, now voted out) had already submitted a corresponding postulate in July 2011.
Because the SVP parliamentary group had requested the rejection, the postulate could not be transferred to the city council until October 2012-after a vote in the local council.The city council has still not answered the postulate.The government has time for this by the end of October.
Matthias Probst, who also sits on the board of the lobbying organization Pro Velo Zurich, does not promise a great thrust effect from the Basel pilot test despite the positive campaign: "If the will were available to the authorities, they would have been testing a test operation for a long time."Probst says that he cannot understand the inactivity of the police department: «Police leader Richard Wolff has signaled us several times that he supports our concern.But nothing has happened so far."Probst is also skeptical whether the outstanding answer of the city council to his postulate will finally get the matter rolling:" I am afraid that the city council will hide behind phrases and recommend that the Astra answer to the Basel initiative.
A temporary game. »However, the green politician has not yet given up his fight:« If the city council's answer is negative, we will launch new advances at a parliamentary level.»In concrete terms, he has a new postulate to the city council in a storey, which demands its own traffic lights for bike drivers at certain street crossings - another way to enable bikers to turn right during the red phase.
In addition, Probst works together with the Green Group of the National Council on a promotion that aims to change the Swiss Road Traffic Act.Red is red, at least in Zurich: cyclist on Sihlstrasse.Photo: Keystone

Velos should be allowed to turn right at red / / Motion · The GB / JA faction wants bicycles in Bern like in Basel to turn right at red.
The green alliance and young alternative are not satisfied with bike policy in the city of Bern."Compared to other cities, Bern is hardly progressing in terms of promotion," they write in a media release.“Safe and rapid bike compounds with bicycle-friendly light signal systems were among the crucial criteria so that more people choose bike”. A possible measure to make forward in this area sees the GB / JA fraction in traffic lights that allow bicycleTurn the red to the right and cross intersections together with pedestrians.
This is precisely this as a GB / JA-MOTION that will be submitted to the city council this week.Experiences from Holland, Denmark, Norway or France showed that this could be done safely, it says in the advance.Basel-Stadt is enthusiastic four years ago, the local council had to check the introduction of such bike-friendly light signal systems.
At the time, he referred to the signaling regulation, which does not allow the right turn of Velos at Red. "Now the canton of Basel-Stadt is much more creative,» GB / YES: since June 2013, bike at certain intersections has been the right-wing turn at red as a pilot testallowed.Last month, the Basel construction and traffic department “drawn a very positive” conclusion: fewer conflicts between bicycles and motor vehicles, good acceptance among footmaster, no accidents.

If it gets tight in the city, the bike is to get right of way / / The Bernese municipal council has announced a bike offensive.The proportion of cyclists should increase strikingly.
How do you want to achieve this?While the municipal council relies on a new bike culture and initially wants to sensitize the administration, Pro Velo sees concrete projects.Munich has achieved what the red-green majority in Bern has been targeting for years:
The state capital of Bavaria is a “Velostadt”, a shining example of bike funding.Over 17 percent of total traffic falls on cyclists in Munich.In the city of Bern, this value has been stagnating at 11 percent for years.
And Bayern don't rest on the laurels.Now they want to become a “cycling capital”.The corresponding campaign is running.
On the urban website you will find everything you need to know about cycling.Missing for new Zuzüger, bike + ride, cards for tours, an overview of parks with jumping elements or news such as bike.A true bike offensive.
The Bernese municipal council also announced an offensive in terms of bike funding last week.By 2030, the bike content of overall traffic is to be increased to 20 percent in the city (we reported). Administration of sensitization according to Berner Art is rather leisurely the bike offensive is started.
The municipal council has triggered an "internal administrative process".That means: The topic of bicycles should become more present in all branches of the city administration.
From autumn 2015, the municipal council plans to include politics, business, business and specialist associations and determine concrete measures to promote bicycle traffic.At first glance, that sounds little revolutionary.The association Pro Velo would have liked to be presented to specific funding projects.
President and SP City Councilor David Stampfli makes no secret of this.Pro Velo, however, generally follows the procedure of the local council and greet the efforts for bicycle traffic.«The experiences from other cities show that you first have to pave the ground for certain measures.»
Velo culture cannot be prescribed or delegated to a specialist office.It is therefore certainly the right approach to sensitize the administration to the topic.Velobahn instead of a new tram in Pro Velo there are projects with which the city could soon get started.
After the no to the tram region of Bern, bicycle traffic would have to be funded along line 10, Stampfli.He is convinced: «If Ostermundigen and Köniz gave better and safer bicycle paths, one could move commuters to change.»Velobahn is the magic word: directly, quickly and safely you can get a network of bike on these connections by bike from A to B. Numerous cities in Northern Europe.
In Switzerland, many imagine something wrong, Stampfli has noticed: «They think of a wide street that takes too much space for the other road users.In most cases, bicycles are simply better bike paths.»As an example, Stampfli mentions the Veloweg between Worblaufen, Tiefenau and Henkerbrünnli.
This is wide enough so that bicycles can overtake itself, delimited well from the street, and Velos have no or our own traffic lights. "We are constantly in implementing improvements," replies traffic director Ursula Wyss (SP).This happens parallel to the bike offensive.«The bike is not a substitute for a powerful public transport, but an important addition.»
However, a bike on the 10-line is only possible together with the canton and the communities.Did the red-green majority make too little pace in bike promotion?The President of Pro Velo is diplomatic:
«RGM has strongly promoted public transport.That's good .A lot was made for the bike.
But it could have been more.“The traffic director looks similar.The city has done a lot for public transport in the past 20 years.
But: The proportion of bicycle is average compared to other cities.The potential is much higher.If you want to exploit it, you also have to be consistent, says David Stampfli.
“If Bern wants to be a bicycle city, the bike must come first.»The place in the city is limited.In case of doubt, priority must be granted.
This could also work at the expense of public transport or motorized traffic.“It is of use to everyone if a city is driven a lot of bicycles.»Less traffic jams, less noise and better air are the side effects.
The local council relies on sustainable and space -saving mobility, says Wyss.That means on public transport, foot and bicycle traffic."If the space is too tight to find a good solution for all road users, parking spaces may have to give way." Mirjam Messerli "If there are better bicycle paths, one could move commuters to change." David Stampfli · President ProVelo "If the space is too scarce, may parking places have to give way." Traffic director Ursula Wyssund The e-bikes?
Bicycle traffic in the city of Bern should be promoted - but what bicycles do the efforts apply?Only those operated with pure muscle power or also reinforced with electricity?"With this question we are also increasingly confronted with Pro Velo," says President David Stampfli.
Finally, it has not yet been clarified.Because it is difficult to classify e-bikes in general.«There are different electrovelos.
And: Is an e-bike still an e-bike if the driver does not use the support?»In principle, it is clear to Pro Velo: the funding measures should apply to all two -wheelers that are likely to use the bike strip - except moped.
"E-bikes make sense, especially for longer commuter routes," says Stampfli.It is imperative that bike strips offer enough space for safe overtaking.«There are also slower and faster ones among conventional bikers.»

Two bicycles for the city / / of Urs Ristbasel.«Driving Velo is safe on all the streets open.»
To do this, “dangerous places must be renovated and the existing bike route network must be adapted to the needs of users”.So it says in the new VELO sub -court plan, which the government council issued yesterday.It replaces the Velo / Mofa sub -plan from 1981, which has been expanded and adapted since then.
The government council wrote in a media release for broad approval in the consultation into two different bicycle nets.Commissioner routes are intended to offer a quick connection without detours, whereby the workplace centers, the city center and the train stations are called important destinations.Basic routes are intended to enable a safe development of all goals of everyday and leisure traffic.
The sub -public plan is to continue the city -friendly and environmentally friendly mobility, which is determined in the Environmental Protection Act.It is intended to increase the proportion of bicycle traffic and thus contribute to the goal of reducing private motor vehicle traffic by ten percent by 2020.The plan also contains 14 non -existent connections, i.e. network gaps that require structural measures.
The Rheinpromenade St.-Johanns-Park-Huningue, further the connections along the port of Kleinhüningen / Klybeck, through the Erlenmatt, Burgfelderstrasse-Friedrich-Miescher-Strasse and through the long alder along the meadow.Intermediate results are available for the Velobrücke via Zolli, the connection between the S-Bahn stop Dreich and Vienna-Strasse as well as from Riehen to Lörrach via the Mühleteich.Other projects are still on the priority stand, such as additional bridges over the Rhine between the Black Forest and Wettstein Bridge and the track field of the SBB station.
Eight bike stations are also to be built at the train stations and in the city center as well as bike and ride systems for S-Bahn, tram and bus stops.Large projects from CHF 300,000 must be approved as investments by the Grand Council.The existing framework permits for bicycle traffic are still available until 2015, after which the budget is to be increased, the report says.

A bike at any time, TA from November 18th / / Safety requirements are missing.In spring 2016, the automatic bike rental “Züri Velo” is scheduled to start operating.
Basically, this idea of the city of Zurich is welcome.However, I have great concerns because, in my opinion, important conditions are not available.I have also been traveling with the bike in the city of Zurich.
It was a disaster !There are far too few signs for cyclists;Unexpectedly, you end up on a busy street.
If special traffic lights in other cities are very helpful for cyclists, they are missing in Zurich.Yellow markings that are available in other cities are also missing very often.In this regard, the city of Zurich has a great need to catch up.
At the age of 72, I drove 3000 bike kilometers this season.I know what I'm talking about .For a month, those responsible for traffic should only be traveling by bike in the city for a month, so you might notice what is important.
Such criteria cannot only be clarified from the office table.If the project is to work, those responsible must first work out the basics.Alfred Rentsch, Gränichen

Rental “Züri Velo” - flop programmed?/ / While saving would be announced, the city of Zurich cheerfully drives an automatic bike rental under the “Züri Velo” label (NZZ 4. 12. 14).All doubts seems to wipe away that the semi -governmental Zurich cantonal bank could be won as a sponsor.
Although even the Zurich city council grants that hardly any relocation of car trips can be expected.Nevertheless, one hopes for commuters, young people and tourists as a user - as if the city were now a breeder.Commuters do not get involved in the game whether a rental bike is really available in front of the door or at the train station.
Velos with deep blow -up are an insult to the eye and so heavy that local young people pass the desire to cycle smoothly.Tourists, in turn, rave about the elegant “Züri rolls” city bikes and experience “World Class-Swiss Made” up close.A tie -up burden would be the first quality to hire this and proven loan service for this.
It enables groups that can also be extended together and that the redistribution that is necessary for automatic rental distribution via trucks or peripheral stations is largely eliminated.E-bikes are still carriers and maintenance-intensive, as the latest attempt in Copenhagen shows with so-called gobikes.Public transport is not relieved because a large part of these occasional users changes to the tram again in winter.
We don't live under the sun of the south, even if Hafenkran enthusiasts imagine something else.Instead of producing another expensive flop with the "Züri Velos", the ZKB should support a increased "Züri rolls"- fleet and low-threshold jobs.Bruno Pfeuti, Zurich

Switzerland pedalt far behind / / regardless of whether it is about quality of life, income or clean water: Switzerland is always at the top of international rankings.Just not with the bike.
There is no official ranking for Veloparadiese, the most representative is the “Copenhagenize index” from 2013. Copenhagenize is a worldwide advisory office for bicycle funding.The index selects the 20 most bike -friendly cities:
Amsterdam is at the top, followed by Copenhagen.Paris and Hamburg took 19 and 20.Not a single Swiss city made it to the list.
The Association Pro Velo now wants to make Switzerland more bike with a popular initiative.The constitution is intended to ensure that the federal government not only defines the principles for the foot and hiking trails, but also for the bicycle traffic network.Reved paths would have to be replaced.
The initiators want to promote cycling because it is healthy, environmentally friendly, space -saving and cheap.Today the bike is far from being the Swiss love of transport.In the canton of Zurich, 4 percent of all paths are covered by bike.
It is 50 percent in Groningen in Dutch.In the city of Zurich, the proportion of bicycle traffic was 6 percent in 2005 and 2010.The proportion of motorized private transport (MIV) is five times higher.
In Copenhagen, bike traffic accounts for 36 percent of total traffic, significantly more than the MIV with 29 percent.30,000 people climb bike every day in Copenhagen.Politicians want to further increase the bike content to 50 percent.
Freeches pay out to be outstanding by Swiss cities is no coincidence.Successful bicycles offer continuous bicycle nets, the one in Copenhagen is 370 kilometers long.The paths separated from the cars of the car are often so wide that three cyclists can drive side by side.
Traffic lights prefer bicycle traffic with a green wave, bridges were adapted for cyclists, and the plow first frees the bike paths of snow in winter.In 2013 Copenhagen invested around 33 million euros to improve the conditions for cyclists.It's worth it :
In a report by the Ministry of the Environment, it is said that cycling will reduce the annual health costs by a total of 227 million euros.In Copenhagen alone.There are also remarkable bicycle in Seville, which built 80 kilometers of new bike paths within a year.
Several French cities shine through successful bike rental systems, in Tokyo, the largest city in the "Copenhagenize index", the strict driving school is praised for drivers, which significantly increases security on the streets.Amsterdam, number 1, therefore received more points than Copenhagen, because there is also intensive bike outside the city center.Above all, Amsterdam is the only place in the world where there are no agitation against cyclists.
Zurich is located by the city of Zurich, the wheel network measures 205 kilometers.Together, the city and canton invest an average of CHF 8 million a year in the bike routes.However, the political climate is quite frosty, the SVP combats all urban bicycles.
This climate is likely to help Zurich's bike friendliness almost always get deep -level notes.When a Danish bike specialist cycled through Zurich in 2012 at the invitation of the TA, he came to the conclusion that the city was “light years in the back”: no separate Velotrassees, no bicycles, sometimes there are bike strips, sometimes not.He described the network of path as a piece of piece without strategy.
Zurich is not representative of bike friendliness.In 2014, Pro Velo published the results of a survey, which determined the satisfaction of bike drivers throughout Switzerland.Burgdorf (grade 4.8) achieved the best grade, in second and third place Chur and Winterthur (both 4.4).
Zurich took 28th and last place (3.2).The survey shows what cyclists suffer from the most.Rough traffic climate, feelings of uncertainty, poor bike paths, bad snow removal.
It is gratifying that the initiative wants to rethink.That alone is not enough.Because what cyclists really need is very banal: space on the street.

Everyone makes the cyclist / / cyclist a kind of special status in Copenhagen.They get a lot of space on the streets, sometimes more than the cars.
You can drive off at some traffic lights after the red phase and shorten it frequently, even through cemeteries.The fact that the city treats its cyclists so well has a long tradition.Already after the oil crisis in the 1970s, she has expanded the cycle path network more consistently than other cities.
Today it has become a fundamental democratic right that everyone gets along quickly and free of charge with their bike.At the end of 2011, the city council, which has been led to social democratic since the 1930s, decided to make Copenhagen the most bike -friendly city in the world by 2025.For Copenhagen, cyclists have long since become a location factor:
The city has been marketing itself internationally for several years as the “City of Cyclists” and model for cycling concepts.As early as 2012, 36 percent of Copenhagener drove to school or to work by two -wheeler, 50 percent will soon be.The Danish Transport Minister Magnus Heunicke, also a social democrat, is not enough.
He published a new national bike strategy in summer 2014.In the foreword, he complains that the Danes travel less bike today than in the nineties.He now invests 180 million crowns (around CHF 25.5 million) in more bicycle motorways-“Cycle Superhighways”-on which cyclists can cover long distances faster.
Another 175 million crowns are to flow into new initiatives in the existing road network.21 million are intended to avoid accidents with bicycles when turning right.The ministry also calculates the benefits of bike production to the Danes:
For every kilometer that a Dane in the city with the bike instead of by car, he saves 7 crowns to the health system.An even more tangible argument is the lack of space, especially in Copenhagen with its many bridges: the Drronning Louises Bro alone crosses up to 40,000 cyclists every day.

I was looking forward to a pedestrian zone as an old town resident.It seems that it would have to be called bike.On the middle bridge, for example, the pedestrians, partly disabled by strollers, crowd on the sidewalks on both sides, while cyclists enjoy the street in two - side by side.
If you have to switch to the street with a large pedestrian density, you get to hear "all -off".So it seems that the new inner city traffic regime has brought something in particular to the bicycles and less to the footballers.This is annoying.

Region Thun drives on to Velos / / Traffic · As much as in the agglomeration Thun is almost nowhere to be driven in Switzerland.
This conclusion comes a study that will be published in the next few weeks.It is based on data from 2010 and explores the question of how big the proportion of stages that are covered in a region with the bike.In the Thun region - next to the Kyburgstadt, the municipalities of Spiez, Uetendorf, Heimberg and Steffisburg - the proportion is 10.3 percent.
For the Association Pro Velo Region Thun, this study result is not a reason to rejoice.Because: Basically, the bike is used in this country, in other comparisons, Thun is anything but good - and the future prospects are not really rosy.

According to the study: Thun is Velo stronghold / / traffic ·
More than ten percent of all routes covered every day are mastered with the bike in the agglomeration Thun.The region is therefore one of the leaders nationwide.In the agglomeration Thun - alongside Thun the communities of Spiez, Uetendorf, Heimberg and Steffisburg - as much bike is driven as almosthere else in Switzerland.
This is the result of a study that created the Bernese office for mobility, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and the research company Interface and presented them on the occasion of a conference of the Swiss Association of Transport Engineers and Transport experts and which is to be published in the next few weeks.Far beyond Swiss cuts in the key statements of the study: more than ten percent of all stages that are covered in the five municipalities are mastered with the bike.
By definition, a stage is part of a path, for example the route from home to the train station, which is covered with the bike.The sum of all of these sections for work, including a train journey, are considered a way.This increases more than twice as much bike in Thun and the surrounding communities as in the rest of Switzerland.
Nationwide, only 4.8 percent of stages are covered with the bike - a trend falls.A part of the study also shows more potential for the preliminary potential of how much potential bicycle traffic in the regions examined would still have.Conclusion for the region: Even if we are already in the top four, there is still room for improvement.
Specifically, the researchers assume that the proportion of bicycle traffic in the agglomeration Thun could grow by a further 2.4 percent - that is, a quarter more stages could be covered by bike than today."And only with the measures proven in Switzerland to promote bicycle traffic," says Uwe Schlosser, co-author of the study."With courageous and innovative measures - such as bicycle routes - more would be possible." "No reason for the euphoria for René Lüthi, President of Pro Velo Region for 20 years, the study results are no reason to perform a joy dance.
"If the communities were included in the right lake shore, the results look very different," he is convinced.Lüthi also refers to a survey in which Pro Velo Switzerland was looking for the most bike -friendly city in Switzerland.There, Thun ranks 15th out of 28 rated cities.
The Burgdorf survey was curved up at the top, which also ranks third in the study for bike use.The most exciting part of the study on the use of bicycles is the one in which the potential of the regions examined is shown.“It can be seen what would still be possible in the region - if the necessary financial resources were made available.»
At the same time, Lüthi is convinced as a co -initiator of the urban initiative (see box) that thanks to the assumption of the same, some will develop in a more bike -friendly direction."At the same time, he emphasizes:" The various road users must not be played against each other.Rather, more synergies should be created.

President Pro Velo Region Thun «With courageous and innovative measures-such as Velosglenellrouten-would be even more possible.» Uwe Schlosser co-author The studies-establishing company velocal traffic is to be promoted.
This requires the enactment of a regulations to "protect the population from the negative effects of traffic".The initiators list various measures that have to be implemented, among other things to promote bike intercourse: continuous and direct bicycle routes; the promotion of combined mobility and mobility management; an attractive and safe footpath network; an expansion of the bus network and the preference of busesNeuralgian bodies.The new and expansion of main traffic in Thun is only permitted if the capacity of the entire road network for motorized private transport does not increase.
The proportion of public transport, foot and bicycle traffic on the entire volume of traffic must also be increased by at least 10 percent within 10 years.According to the initiative text, the municipal council must use a "broad working group" and report on the implemented measures.The Thun urban initiative is supported by WWF, Pro Velo, VCS and the parties SP, Juso, Greens, Junge Greens, GLP, EVP and EDU.
Uwe Sommer from the Mobility office says that the implementation of the initiative has the potential to "give bicycle traffic in the region a huge boost".In Zurich, St. Gallen and Geneva, the urban initiative was also accepted, whereas in Lucerne, Winterthur and Basel, counter -proposals of the city regulations found the favor of the sovereign.In Biel, the initiative was submitted in the form of a simple suggestion.

Request for Velostrassen / / Michael Baumann (MBM) With the advent of electric bicycles, the bike lobby was faced with a new situation.
Do you want to include the fast two-wheelers supported by an electric motor in the circle of bicycles, for which you start politically and strive for improvements?This question was discussed internally at Pro Velo.In the end, it was agreed that you can also see yourself as a representative of the concerns of the e-bike drivers.
As Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo Kanton Zurich, says in conversation, it is basically a bike if you have to kick.And that is still necessary for the electrovelo.From the perspective of Pro Velo, e-bike ideal for Zurichdurner sees no problems with the e-bikes, but he sees them as a great opportunity, especially in the partly hilly city of Zurich.
In addition, people rose to the bike with an electric drive who would otherwise not or would no longer drive.Finally, the radius of action is enlarged by commuters.Durner is convinced that a third of the e-bike drivers come from motorized private transport, public transport and the bike operated with muscle strength.
For reasons of space, the Pro-Velo managing director does not consider a comprehensive infrastructure with charging stations for e-bike to be realistic in Zurich.The operation of charging stations is neither absolutely a state task, nor does the electricity have to be handed over free of charge.Such systems would have to be able to be operated.
At the Velonetz in the canton of Zurich, Durner locates the need for action.It must be improved at certain points, especially with tight curves.With the e-bike, changes in directions at a 90-degree angle can hardly be mastered.
In the city of Zurich, the fast routes planned in the Velo master plan should be suitable for all bicycles.Durner considers his own traces for e-bikes as illusory.For this, the introduction of so -called bike streets could be checked.
Pilot project possible in other countries, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, is already relatively common, per bike also wants to introduce in Switzerland.In principle, a Velostrasse is nothing more than a Tempo 30 zone, on which there is no legal advance and the bike always progresses.4.80 meters are necessary as a minimum width for such a street.
In order to achieve this value, according to Dave Durner, it is inevitable to lift car parking spaces at certain points.This makes it possible for cyclists to overtake each other or drive side by side.Such a bike street is easy to drive for both fast and inexperienced cyclists.
And the facility is favorable because almost only marking work, but hardly any structural adjustments would be necessary.A generous donation used Pro Velo Kanton Zurich to roughly plan two bike streets in the city of Zurich.One project concerns Scheuchzerstrasse, the other the Axis Regensberger, Affoltern- and Riedenhaldenstrasse.
It has been shown that cyclists have to stop on bike breeds much less often.The projects had been discussed with the police department, which signaled fundamental interest.The federal government, however, is more skeptical.
At the moment, the projects in the traffic department are interested in starting a pilot project.Questions such as the handling of individual intersections that have to meet special demands for each bike clarifies.In addition, a network of bike breeds is evaluated across the entire city, which could lead through the Mühlebach, Dufour, the Zurlinden-, Bulllinger and Baslerstrasse.

In Bern, 2000 rental bikes will soon be / / traffic · The city of Bern should become more bike -friendly.
The municipal council wants to introduce a bicycle loan system with 2000 rental bikes.In addition, new bicycle spaces are to be created.In European metropolises such as Paris or Barcelona, they have long shaped the cityscape - the mostly colorful city bikes, which can be borrowed independently at one of numerous stations and can be returned to any other station.
Swiss cities such as Lucerne or Biel have also introduced public bicycle systems in recent years.Now the project is getting rolling here too.For a corresponding offer in the federal city, the local council has adopted a planning loan of CHF 300,000 of the city parliament.
"We are convinced that a bicycle loan system belongs to a bicycle -friendly city," said traffic director Ursula Wyss (SP) in front of the media yesterday.The goal is the simples rental system that makes people more accessible to people.The offer is not only intended for tourists, but also for the Bernese population 22000 Velos at 180 station credits are planned for 180 stations with a total of 2000 rental bikes, spread over the entire urban area.
A rental station is to be built about every 300 meters, where you can borrow a bike at any time of the day and thus be on the road for up to half an hour at a time.However, the bike rental will not be free of charge.Users have to buy a subscription for a certain period of time.
How much of this cost is not yet clear."But for people who are often on the road for short distances with the bike, it will certainly be cheap," promises Wyss.The city will not operate the bike loan itself, but will instruct an external service provider.
Social policy goals should also be taken into account in the public tender.The municipal council wants the municipal competence center work that employs training and unemployed people in the company.If everything runs according to plan, the rental bikes should curve as early as 2017.
More bike plans are so far, but the city government does not want to remain idle.Last autumn, as part of a “bike offensive”, she announced that she would sustainably promote bicycle traffic in the future.The goal: by 2030 at least one fifth road user should be a cyclist - today only about one in ten is on the road on Bern's streets.
In order to gradually make Bern more bike, the local council has now presented the first concrete measures yesterday.So he wants to create around 500 new bike parking spaces in the city this year.Especially near the station should be upgraded - in front of the burger hospital, at the bulwark and along the Bundesgasse, 240 parking spaces will be built in April.
By autumn, more will follow at various locations.According to Ursula Wyss, many school houses are particularly needed.Oncoming traffic only for bicycles. Further planned measure affects the storage mass.
This can only be driven from the bulwark today.Velogegenverkehr is therefore to be introduced between the orphanage and Generagasse.Additional velop parking spaces are also to be created on the sidewalk center in front of the Kulturzentrum PrOUR and the existing car delivery places are to be moved to Hodlerstrasse.
According to Wyss, the traffic safety of the bicycles also applies: «Unfortunately, they are still involved in accidents far too often.»At several delicate branching points, the bike strips are therefore colored red for better labeling and partially made wider.
Both SP and Pro Velo Bern welcome the measures.However, the joy of the green alliance and the young alternative.The announced measures had long since been requested by the city council.
The municipal council misses courage and willingness to design.If the desired higher bike content should actually be achieved, the city government will "have to tease a gear" .Christoph Albrecht

Bicycle drivers want free trip on the smooth / / thanks to a compromise, pedestrians, cyclists and nature lovers should be taken on their bill on the bank of the Glattufer between the Opfikon and Dübendorf.Conflicts are programmed for Pro Velo.
Andreas Schürerdas Glatttal is booming and is one of the most attractive business locations in Switzerland.With a pioneer project, as Peter Spörri calls it, it is now to ensure that the dynamic growth region also receives an identity -creating recreation area.Spörri is the deputy department head in the cantonal office for traffic, member of the management of the Zurich planning group Glatttal (ZPG) and local council in Valaisellen.
His different functions go well with the project.For Spörri, the cooperation of everyone involved is primarily pioneering: In addition to the ZPG, the canton, the cities of Zurich, Opfikon and Dübendorf and the municipality of Valaisellen are on the boat.
According to Spörri, the goal is to upgrade the recreation room along the smooth and make it better accessible.The river area is still a shadowy existence as a local recreation room, the path along the bank is not continuously and sometimes inhospitable.On Tuesday, the project group led by Grün Stadt Zurich published a joint declaration of intent.
Under the name "Fil Bleu" (blue thread), it defines a national open space concept for the area along the smooth.The cross -municipal area planning is coordinated with the new water protection law and integrated into the federal agglomeration program.According to Spörri, the guiding principle of the project is to find a good compromise: to create attractive offers for cyclists and pedestrians and at the same time.
For this purpose, the center areas of Dübendorf and Opfikon are to be designed like a park and relaxation -oriented, while in the “Green Mitte” there is a greater weight.A continuous, at least four meters of knowledgeable path is planned for foot and bicycle traffic, which is also intended to offer professional donors an alternative to the existing network network.In the area of the “green center” this path is planned along the left bank (“Rive Gauche”), where it will also be concentrated, which is called a recovery infrastructure in the concept: benches or selective water access, for example.
Meanwhile, ecological revaluations are planned on the right bank (“Rive Droite”).The overall project management is now transferred to the Cantonal Office of Transport by Grün Stadt Zurich.Spörri expects the implementation to begin in two to three years;
Before that, among other things, an adjustment of the regional guide plan is necessary, and a feasibility study with cost estimate is also developed.According to Spörri, according to the current state of knowledge, the necessary investments are at least ten million francs to build the path alone.For Grünstadt Zurich, the present thrust is a good compromise, as spokesman Marc Werlen says.
It is clear that not everyone is completely satisfied if you have to share space.With Pro Velo Zurich, however, the resentment is great.The “Fil Bleu” project is called “Fil Gumm” in the club of the bicycle driver lobby and is referred to as a mogue pack in a media release.
Managing Director Dave Durner criticizes that the original infrastructure- a nature conservation project had become- but this was also not astonishing after the elaboration was entrusted to Grün Stadt Zurich.The needs of everyday cycling are not exactly priority in this position.The one -sided path that walkers, families and everyday cycling would have to share is insufficient, says Durner:
«Conflicts are programmed, especially since bicycles don't have good alternatives.»Per bicycles calls for the unbundling of foot and bicycle traffic, preferably separated.In the minimum, however, the planned path must be extended to at least five meters.

According to the initiative text, the municipal council must use a "broad working group" and report on the implemented measures.The Thun urban initiative is supported by WWF, Pro Velo, VCS and the parties SP, Juso, Greens, Junge Greens, GLP, EVP and EDU.Uwe Sommer from the Mobility office says that the implementation of the initiative has the potential to "give bicycle traffic in the region a huge boost".
In Zurich, St. Gallen and Geneva, the urban initiative was also accepted, whereas in Lucerne, Winterthur and Basel, counter -proposals of the city regulations found the favor of the sovereign.In Biel, the initiative was submitted in the form of a simple suggestion.In December 2014, the city council was able to vote directly on a draft regulations that was previously drawn up by the city together with the initiators - and accepted it.

Collecting for Velo Initiative / / / Region Thun · Pro Velo wants to promote Velowege:
Therefore, the organization collects signatures for an initiative.The 2014 annual accounts concluded with a surplus.The general meeting of Pro Velo region
Thun was all about the bike.“This promotes bicycle paths by giving this analogous to the hiking trails a legal basis.A safe bike path network is of use to everyone:
More bicycles mean more space in public transport and on the street, less noise and deeper costs, »says the organization.In addition, regular everyday movement is promoted sustainably, as René Lüthi, physiotherapist and President of Pro Velo Thun explained.In addition to the financial commitment of Pro Velo, the support of all members is needed so that the required signatures are collected.
Positive invoice results Lüthi led through the statutory part: in 2014 a lot of work was done on the bicycles, the bike courses, the light action, construction projects and in the traffic commission."Thanks to the good result on the bicycles, the annual accounts show a positive yield," says the communication of Pro Velo.

Velonetz yes, parking spaces na / / The bike initiative demands 200 million francs to better combine the bike paths in the city of Zurich.Simon Eppenberger Zurich - the distribution struggle for the square on the Stadtzürcher streets goes into the next round.
The bike initiative requires to expand the patchwork of the bicycle paths into a network.With their proposal, VCS, Pro Velo and the parties from left-green to the GLP are calling for CHF 10 million an annual for civil engineering-for 20 years.The total 200 million should be available to the city council as a framework loan to improve the situation for cyclists. "A symbolic amount," said the Green Councilor Matthias Probst at yesterday's presentation of the JA Committee.
With such an amount in road construction, no major projects could be realized.And the CHF 10 million would correspond to a per thousand of the city's annual budget, explained Probst.Suddenly accepted the template on June 14 in the one -way street, the city council could determine how it wants to use the money in concrete terms.
According to the VCS managing director and Greens council, Markus Knauss is not lacking opportunities.On the media tour of Velo, he showed the exemplary situation near the Customs/Langstrasse intersection.If you drive from the main train station along the tracks towards Röntgenplatz, you suddenly get into a one -way street.
Most cyclists disregard the diversion away from Zollstrasse without bad intentions."She is neither good to see nor makes it sense," said Knauss.In such traffic tours, bike drivers would intuitively take the wrong and often dangerously narrow path along parked cars.
The solution is obvious for him: a few parking spaces would have to be postponed or disappear.He considers that including bike parking spaces.
"This could be placed in the cross road." The narrow space in the city of Zurich are responsible for the interruption of existing bicycle paths in many places.In order to create a real Velonetz, you could break down parking spaces.The initiative committee does not make this requirement, because it would have little success.
But it is clear to the initiators that too many parked cars are a dangerous obstacle and robber of space.Instead of reducing parking spaces, they are asking the city council to file the details. "It takes more clarity on the street and a traffic routing so that the whole family feels comfortable," said Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo Zurich.That doesn't always have to be expensive.
Red markings of the bike strips are good examples of this.And of course the Langstrasse in Circle 4 should finally be able to drive by Velos legally in both directions.The city government rejects the 200 million initiative.

Velor routes for CHF 200 million / / With the Velo Initiative, the young Greens want to advance the expansion of the Stadtzürcher cycle path network.On June 14th, the city council also coordinates.
Irène Troxlervelof promotion is an old concern in the city of Zurich and now appears in almost all strategy papers.As early as 1990, the city council decided that besides public transport, bicycle and foot traffic had to be preferred.In 2012, the Velo master plan followed with the aim of double the proportion of bicycle travelers by 2025.
Velo promotion is also well anchored at the cantonal level.In the cantonal structure plan it says that bicycle traffic should be supported primarily at short distances and in densely populated areas.If you would measure success in good will, Zurich should actually be a bicycle paradise.
Everyone who regularly pedals knows that this is not the case.In contrast to German, Dutch or Scandinavian major cities, cycling in Zurich is not for beginners.There are several dangerous places, and the most cozy bicycle paths sometimes result in a five -lane expressway - without bike strips.
Velo not the top priority of the reasons for the deficits are diverse.On the one hand, there is often a lack of space in the city center, on the other hand, the bike in the offices does not always seem to enjoy the top priority.In any case, the young Greens did not go ahead quickly, which is why they launched the bike initiative for safe and consistent bicycle routes in 2012.
This requires a framework loan of CHF 200 million without detailed information for which routes the money is to be used for.The project is supported by Greens, SP, AL, GLP and the organizations VCS, WWF, Pro Velo and by traffic.The city council recommends the initiative for rejection and has developed a counter -proposal.
In this he points out that the city is only responsible for the municipal bike routes.The canton, on the other hand, must finance the 240 kilometer cycle path network on urban soil, which are defined in the regional structure plan.Therefore, an urban framework loan should only be used for the expansion of the municipal route network, the city council believes.
Projects of CHF 40 million are planned there in the next ten years.If you prioritize the bicycle path projects, another 50 million could be installed.To do this, he adds an amount of CHF 30 million for bike stations and parking spaces and comes to the sum of CHF 120 million.
It should explicitly only be used for the bike infrastructure that the city has to finance.Court are skeptical of the bourgeois that are critical of the bike loans;For financial reasons, but also because they do not want to privilege a means of transport.
FDP and SVP reject both templates.The CVP is against the initiative and has decided on the counter -proposal voting approval.With large sums, more space is to be created for cyclists in Zurich.
Goran Basic / Nzzine Art Autobahn only for bicycle viruses Troxler (tox) tox.· In order to illustrate the goals of the bike initiative, the representatives of the Greens, SP, GLP, VCS and Pro Velo organized a media bike ride on neuralgic points of the Zurich cycle network on Thursday.
It must be possible that children, old people and other people who are unsure about the bike could also ride bike in the city, said the green municipal council Matthias Probst.On the tour, it quickly became clear that the hottest focal points of the network affect regional routes.This is no wonder, because on the cantonal roads the bicycles have to share the scarce space by car, tram and bus.
The Co-managing director of VCS, Markus Knauss, said a long list of suggestions for improvement.For example, the crossing of Sihl, Limmat, railway tracks and motorway supplements for cyclists has been solved unsatisfactively.The initiators want to finance the widening of the long-term underpass from the 200 million franco loan.
This, although this is a regional velor route for which the canton would actually be responsible.At the Giesshübel train station and at the Sihlcity shopping center, they propose new bridges over the Sihl, since the well -developed bike path along Sihl is only difficult to reach today.Another idea that was illustrated on the tour is the construction of so -called bicycles.
These are streets for fast bicycle traffic in which transverse streets have no advance.Cars would only be limited to a limited extent on this road type.According to the initiators, the Stauffacher/Bulllinger/Baslerstrasse axis is suitable for an experiment as a connection between Helvetiaplatz and Altstetten.
In many places, the Velonetz can be improved with simple measures that didn't cost much, say the initiators.For example, the routes would have to be better signaled.However, bicycle traffic should not be funded at the expense of pedestrians.
For some of the denounced focal points, however, one wonders whether there is no whining at a high level.You have to be a die-hard bike lobbyist to fight the idea that parking spaces in the Bertastrasse in Tempo 30 zone should give way to a comfort bike route.Also a rather harmless finding is that bikers in Zollstrasse have to drive around a block because it is too narrow for oncoming traffic because of parking spaces-which also includes bicycle parking spaces.

Thrust for bicycles - but not so / / the bike routes in the city of Zurich leave something to be desired.Everyone knows that who regularly steps into the pedals.
The greens are torn to the young Greens.With a popular initiative, you are calling for a framework loan over CHF 200 million to complete the Velonetz in the Limmatstadt.The goal can be agreed.
Only a small part of the paths are covered with the bike today, but the tendency points upwards.Zurich grows even further, which is known to go out, then it will be even closer on the street and in tram and bus.To rely on the bike as a space -saving and ecological means of transport, so it is a bid of the hour.
However, unsuitable recipe of the recipe that the promoters of the Velo initiative present is aimed at the problem.Simply pull out and hope the checkbook, then everything will be fine, doesn't help.If the red-green parties and the bike associations are surprised that it is no better around the Zurich bike paths, you should first turn in front of your own door.
Between 2002 and 2014, the responsible civil engineering office was firmly in a red-green hand.At first Martin Waser (Sp.) Was responsible, then the green Ruth Genner.And the red-green dominated municipal council would certainly not have stood in the way.
The reasons for the slow pace in expanding the bike infrastructure are not financial in nature.On the one hand, bike paths are usually built when street renovations are due anyway, otherwise 200 million francs would not be enough.However, these renovation cycles are measured in decades, not in years.
On the other hand, the conditions in Zurich are narrow, and there are traffic nodes that can be made difficult to bike.Creativity is primarily required here.If the administration presents a good solution, the municipal council will grant the necessary loan.
Incidentally, the new Filippo Leutenegger (FDP.) Civil engineering board has ironically hired a significantly higher sum for bicycle paths in the budget than its predecessor Genner has done in recent years.So it can be assumed that he is forward, even if he does not describe himself as a "bike politician".
Serious weakening initiative therefore does not bring much - just as little as the city council's more modest counter -proposal.But it has serious weaknesses.So there is simply talk of “bike routes” in the text.
However, the city of Zurich are partly located on municipal, partly on cantonal streets.Funding also depends on this assignment: the canton must generally pay for the more important routes on cantonal roads.
However, the initiative text does not consider these framework conditions.This remains unclear what the money should be spent on.It is also difficult to understand that CHF 200 million should be reserved for the road construction in financially difficult times, beyond two decades.
In the city parliament, compromises in the cultural expenditure are now being discussed;You save on children's cribs, schools and staff.To exclude a single means of transport from every debate about costs and benefits is wrong.
The same applies to the counter-proposal of the city council, according to which CHF 120 million should be used for municipal routes and bike parking spaces.What in Zurich Nottut is an ideology -free traffic planning that does not play a bike against car, as was the case in the past.The city council has marked its way in its Masterplan Velo.

Flat .Flat.If you don't know the seven hills of Copenhagen: don't worry, there are no!
In Copenhagen, the height difference between the quarters is around 10 meters, even to Federiksberg it goes up only 30 meters.In Zurich you have to overcome 100 meters from Central to the University of Irchel, from Wipkingerplatz 70 meters to Bucheggplatz.Even from the Selnau "high" to the Triemliquartier, it is still 40 meters.
Of course, more infrastructure and parking spaces (possibly subject to a fee in Zurich must be provided for bicycles and bike gaps are closed.But the proportionality must remain preserved for a city where the mass will never go to work with the bike.The Pro-Velo board of directors can turn up together collectively and wiggle the ears or throw 200 million out, nothing will help:

"For a rethink" - "No financial corset" / / Should the city of Zurich reserve CHF 200 million for the construction of bike routes?Two traffic politicians disagree whether the Velo initiative is promoting the cycle path network.
Which grade do you give Zurich as a bike city - on a scale from 1 to 6? Markus Knauss: 3.5.You can see that something has happened in recent years, but there is still no nationwide network.
In many places, as a bike driver, you suddenly face nothing.We have to work on that.Therefore almost insufficient.
Marc Bourgeois: I wouldn't give a better note.I see problems primarily with the big traffic nodes.
Here the question arises whether you should squeeze all means of transport by the knots or whether you can lead bike routes past it.So do we have a consensus that there is a certain need for action?Knauss: We agree.
Bourgeois: The situation in the city center is in need of improvement.It is acceptable in the residential quarters.Mr. Knauss, you were currently in Munich, which is called the “Radl capital”.
How much better does Munich cut off?Knauss: The Munich fights with the same problems: street and public transport systems are at the limit.The bike routes are more consistent than in Zurich, but there is still a lot of missing.
In short: you are in the same way as we are.The transport systems are at the stop, they say.This is probably the case in every city.
Nevertheless, there are cities where cycling is more happy: Copenhagen or Amsterdam.Why is it so difficult in Zurich?
Bourgeois: The reason for our poor bike route is not a lack of money;so much in advance.There is no bike project that was sunk out of financial considerations.
Therefore, bike initiative and counter-proposal are the wrong approach.It does not create a single additional meter bike path.The problem is that the space is scarce and that the traffic nodes are complicated.
A prime example is Rämistrasse.Here the initiators literally note that “a car trail is not necessarily needed in every direction”.Such a policy ignores the performance of the individual means of transport.
The bike contributes little with stagnating four percent.Do you present the wrong recipe, Mr. Knauss?Knauss: It's about two things: long -term financing and a rethink in the administration.
Amsterdam and Copenhagen have been active for many years;Something like that does not succeed from one day to the next.In Amsterdam in particular, consistent bicycle promotion has made an almost perfect bike route network possible for over thirty years.
This shows that if we provide the necessary financial resources in Zurich in Zurich, then it can plan very differently.We want to create a long -term liability.I have to correct to the Rämistrasse that I do not expect to reduce a car trail, but a creative solution that does not restrict public transport.
Bourgeois: It's different on the campaign website.You also have to be aware that all so -called bicycle cities are flat.In Zurich, even with safe bicycles, many will not bike because it is too hilly.
Not all live in a circle 5 or are physically fit.Despite all the adversities, they regularly bike in the city.How come ?
Knauss: I enjoy it.I am never sick in winter.And I'm mostly faster.
When I recently had to get from a commission meeting to the SVP delegate assembly, I was four minutes in front of the SVP town councils Tuena and checks that came by car.Bourgeois: I drive mountain bike as a sport.So it makes sense to take the bike in city traffic too - but also public transport or car if necessary.
The organization by traffic postulates a new bicycle for Zurich.Hipsters, eco -activists, fathers with children, older women and teenagers are supposed to drive bicycles, as in Copenhagen.A utopia?
Knauss: No, we just have to make the bike path network safer.Many people tell me that they would like to drive bike, but they are afraid, even in places that don't seem particularly problematic to me.So we both, Marc Bourgeois, are probably not representative.
The goal is that also inexperienced and unsafe people can rise on the bike.Bourgeois: In fact, a long -term perspective is needed.With the Velo master plan, however, we already have them.
We do not need a financial corset that incapacitates the municipal council to 20 years.In the budget debates, everyone complains that today over 80 percent of the urban budget are legally specified.This velocredit would have constitutional rank.
If you would have to save, it will be the more tougher that the areas remain, including staff, health, education.It cannot be that strong Lobby's 20-year-old framework loans will be saved and then saved in areas with a weaker lobby.Knauss: I am amazed that a frame loan suddenly should be something bad.
The FDP has also found a wind power frame loan well.The city of Zurich has a budget of CHF 8.5 billion and an investment volume of 1.2 billion a year.We talk about a bike loan of ten million a year here.
Bourgeois: just, per year.The wind power was about a negotiating mandate for the city council so that he can buy investments.Delays from commission and municipal council debates would be fatal here.
Like any larger project, bike projects can be presented to the local council as normal.Knauss: But if the budget does not open, we can no longer save the wind power away.
Bourgeois: The city council can do without new investments.Incidentally, Ruth Genner, as the Greens, did not manage to build continuous bicycle routes, even though the red-green municipal council waves through all the projects.So there is no lack of money.
And when it comes to a sign: This has already been set with the people of the people to the urban initiative and the Masterplan Velo.Both contain measurable goals.The administration knows that it finds majorities for bike projects in the Council.
Knauss: It is all the more astonishing that the projects that would be necessary to achieve the goal do not come.A referendum gives this topic greater legitimation.The urban initiative was a fundamental decision, now we want to break down and provide financing.
Bourgeois: CHF 200 million - with bike stations rather 300 million - are not a small amount.In addition, it is prophetic to want to fix something like this until 2035 in 2015.Mobility needs will probably change by then.
In addition, the costs of bicycle measures cannot be quantified in such a duration.Some cost nothing, such as the adaptation of lanes as part of a renovation.Others are very expensive.
Therefore, we should limit ourselves to the determination of factual goals and determine how much money is needed in the rolling financial planning to achieve the sub -goals.Knauss: There are big chunks such as the lack of track crossings or a bridge over the Sihl.The framework loan offers the basis for driving such projects more faster.
The bike routes that Zurich are supposed to put on are defined in the execution planning.The city has to finance routes on municipal streets, those on cantonal roads of the canton.Which routes should now be financed through the framework loan?
Knauss: It's all about municipal projects.You can also think about innovations, such as so -called bike roads with prioritization of bicycles.Such routes are currently evaluated at the national level.
Bourgeois: I find that the initiators reinterpret their own initiative.In the initiative text, there is clearly talk of a nationwide bike route network.That is also the main criticism of the city council.
We cannot decide an urban framework loan for projects that the canton has to pay.Using the millions only for bike paths on neighborhood streets would be even absurd.There are usually little faults there.
Knauss: There are also expensive projects, such as a connection from the Lettenviaduct via the track field to the freight station...Bourgeois: But we have to talk about such projects in the local council.The Greens certainly want that too.
Knauss :...And even on municipal routes, it quickly becomes expensive when crossing the main streets.For this we want to grant the necessary financial scope.
What do you think, which grade will you give Zurich as a bike city in 20 years?Bourgeois: A 4.5 is within reach, with or without a bike initiative.Knauss: Realistically, we are on a 4.5 in 2025.
But we should then also know how we will get a 5 in another ten years.Moderation: Irène Troxler opinion & debate, page 22marc Bourgeois (left) and Markus Knauss appreciate the wheel, but think differently about the bike initiative.

Missing in Zurich / / extensions urgently needed.In fact, there is no bicycle path network in the city of Zurich.
There are a few hundred meters of bike paths, some dozen red areas (which are also not really protected in traffic), a few kilometers of yellow line lines and some signposted bicycle routes.And all others described in the articles that do not belong to liquid biking traffic.It is tragic that even with redesigned road sections and squares, no decent bike path planning has taken place.
On the contrary, obstacles and traps were still installed in order to make bicycle traffic unattractive.Not to mention the hundreds of insufficiently lowered edges or the wide 30s zone plastering.Fall traps lurk everywhere and are forced to brake.
If we had had a tight bourgeois government for 20 years, the debacle around the bike paths would still be understandable, but with the mostly clear red-green majorities that have mostly been clear for two decades, the whole thing seems to me like a single taller.The extensions required in the two bike initiatives are 20 years late, but are still urgently needed.Matthias Baur, Zurich a lot of fear for fear.
As a bike driver in Zurich, I also had to develop a seventh meaning, sharpen my rest of the senses, anticipate dangers, quickly like a weasel, etc. to get through city traffic without prejudice.Unfortunately, my partner is not a high -performance athlete in this regard.They and all of their friends are really afraid to drive bike in Zurich.
That's why they leave it.I congratulate all those who can follow the flow of traffic in Zurich well, but you should not forget that many potential bicycles are excluded with the current traffic structure.O Antonio Biancchi

Grüne Welle / / Velobahn · The local council wants to create eleven Velohaupstrouten in the city of Bern.
The first is to be built between the city center and Wankdorf and will be put into operation in 2016.Cost: CHF 1.7 million.More room .
More safety .More green traffic lights.Anyone who is traveling with the bike in the city of Bern should receive better driving conditions in the future.
The municipal council wants to create a total of eleven Velo -main routes as part of its bike offensive by 2030 (see map).In the future, the main part of urban bicycle traffic will flow over these axes.For this purpose, various optimizations are planned on the most important bicycle connections between the city center and the outside quarters.
As a first measure, the local council wants to realize the route from the main train station via Nordring to Wankdorfplatz.On this route, the cyclists sometimes get their own track with a minimum width of one and a half meters.On the sections you have to share by public transport, you will also get more space.
And: In order to advance faster, bike drivers benefit from more green waves in the future."Anyone who starts with the bike at the beginning of the green phase will in future receive a 'green window' in the flat and sloping sections of the Wankdorf route at the next light signal system," the municipal council writes in a message.In order to get the project going, the municipal council has now applied for a loan of CHF 1.74 million for the first measure.
A little more than half of the costs are expected to cover the federal government and the canton.If the parliament does not step on the brake, the Velohauptoute Wankdorf will be available to cyclists from 2016.It is not yet certain which route should be realized afterwards

Zurichers drive more bike, TA from 2nd 10th / / annoying bad planning.Our family has been traveling in the city of Zurich with the bike, work and school for many years.
We find that the traffic planning in the city does not meet the drivers or the pedestrians nor the cyclists.Only a few examples of bad planning and annoyance: In all new places that can be driven on with the bike, it has centimeters-high thresholds, including in speed 30 zones.
Not bike -friendly!The traffic light circuits also do not do justice to the pace of bike.The long red phases for pedestrians and cyclists, for example on the General-Guisan-Quai, are incomprehensible and absurd.
Relatively new places such as Paradeplatz or the Schmiede Wiedikon are closed to bicycle travelers.The eternal construction site Birmensdorferstrasse now has a lane less and a bike strip, which is also used by drivers, suppliers and the like, and has become more dangerous than before the car track was reduced.
In addition, the bike strip is not lined in winter.On the partially increased bicycle tracks are drivers who want to turn from side streets.For this, the Birmensdorferstrasse now has a meter -wide promenade for pedestrians.
Because of more attractiveness for cyclists: For us, the situation in the city of Zurich has deteriorated.Margarita Müller, Zurich

Against Velorowdys / / Entente · How much bike traffic does the city of Bern endure?
Not much, says the Entente Bernoise in her new study.In a recent study, the Entente Bernoise is critical of the bike policy.With a share of around 11 percent of road users, bicycles are the smallest traffic group, but it promotes the city with numerous measures.
However, not least because of the narrow space conditions, these would recover a lot of potential for conflict.The Entente Bernoise also criticizes the behavior of the Velorowdys: they would often disregard the traffic rules, "mostly without a consequence of criminal law". This is why the association demands that bicycle traffic will only be funded away from the car axes in the future.
In addition, there should be an educational program for cyclists.For this, a new bike base team is necessary, which is similar to the Pinto intervention force.But the Entente also wants to use harder measures: more controls with admonitions and buses by the police need more controls, the association.PD writes

The city council relies on Velo / / Traffic ·
In the city of Bern, bicycles are to get more space, safe and direct paths.This direction yesterday entered the red-green-middle majority in the city council.It was not an easy evening for city councilors who are critical of the means of transport: "Today we only talk about Velos," sighed Alexander Feuz (SVP) before the meeting began.
Eleven shops were made on the subject of bicycle (see also yesterday's edition).The vast majority of them were spurted by a red-green side and the direction is clear: cyclists should get more space, more security and more comfort in the city.
Because: «The bike is the linchpin in the urban traffic of the future.“That is not a left-green utopia, said GB City Councilor Franziska Grossenbacher, but a quote from a study by the bourgeois TCS.But the bourgeois Bern city councilors cannot be convinced of such studies.
SVP and FDP even want to brake “Velo-Patting” (o-sound postulate SVP) during the bike promotion in Bern.That means: Wild parked bicycles or cyclists who do not adhere to the traffic rules.
In addition, according to SVP City Councilor Rudolf Friedli, you have something against "re-education attempts".It was "planned economy" if red-green wanted to double the share of bike to 20 percent by 2030.The corresponding motion of the GB / yes faction was supported with 39 to 25 votes.
The Council also voted in favor of strengthening regional cooperation in planning bike routes.Criticism of Rytz and Wyssskritik for their bike policy had to take a former and current traffic director.On behalf of the BDP / CVP parliamentary group, Claudio Fischer criticized a missing overall strategy.
The ruling red-green-middle alliance has overslept bike funding over the years and now try to make up for it, Daniel Imthurn (GLP) summarized the bike offensive.The former green traffic director Regula Rytz should have done more for bike funding.The current incumbent Ursula Wyss (SP) was accused by the GB “lack of courage”.
For fear of limiting public transport, large throws for the bike will be dispensed with.Ursula Wyss emphasized that the bike offensive consisted of numerous small measures.It is also important to be clearly measurable.
The doubling of bike traffic is based on calculations."We don't force anyone to the bike." Velohauptraute was the most miserable business was a loan of 1.74 million that the local council presented.
This is intended to realize the first Velohaup route.It should offer a secure connection between Wankdorfplatz and the train station.At 10:30 p.m. Council President Claude Grosjean had to postpone the decision on the loan - there were still too many applications on the table.

Showdown in the urban jungle / / rest.Stockholm Which cyclist has not already experienced the situation himself:
In a traffic situation, one would have the right to go, but it does not have the critical mass of enforcing this opposite cars and, above all, trucks.All too often, the right of larger and stronger applies in the urban jungle.So you make your fist in the sack or swing over the handlebar.
And stops.Rules are actually no different in Sweden either.Such situations arise there, for example, when the street narrowed in front of a pedestrian strip or a bus stop so that road traffic must slow down.
One page then has a clearly regulated right of the right.In contrast to other countries, such as Eastern or Southern Europe, rules in Sweden are generally considered binding and generally followed- which is then expected from others.As in the case of the bike driver, who recently approached the right of such a narrowing in the municipality of Vättersnäs, while a truck came from the other side, the driver of which did not make any institutions to grant the pedaling fellow citizen the right to go.
However, the cyclist could not be disturbed.Instead of making space to make the truck pass, he drove into the narrowing from the other side and only stopped one meter in front of the brummary cooler.The truck had to soften, he asked.
The scene of the event was now hardly possible, because a snake had already formed behind the truck.Preliminary step is ahead, the bike driver said and did not give away for minutes.This can be seen in a video film that a also blocked bus driver recorded and who is now circulating on the Internet.

Co -signer Cédric Luyet (GLP) said that a Velohampa axis was necessary in view of the increasingly greater traffic chaos.All the more than Bern and Köniz promoted bicycle traffic.Several parliamentarians demanded that the lines to be discussed with Köniz and Bern.
In this regard, contacts between the authorities are linked, said municipal councilor Andreas Thomann (SP).He also drawn attention to the discussion on the “Bernstrasse - optimize traffic” popular initiative.It must be clear what is being done on the Bernstrasse.

Bern uses Velo / / Velo offensive The municipal council wants to make Bern a Swiss Velo capital.
In order to achieve the ambitious goal, the core of which is the doubling of the bike content of overall traffic, he blows a bike offensive.In this context, large-scale projects, fast bicycle routes or new parking spaces are to be realized for around CHF 70 million for around CHF 70 million.On the other hand, traffic director Ursula Wyss (SP) presented numerous small and medium -sized measures yesterday that should continuously lead to a “Bernese bike culture”.

Free passage for pedestrians / / from Martin Regenassder Wenkenpark is to be opened for the bicycles between Hellring and Wenkenstrasse.Reason: The Riehen authorities see a gap in the bike route between Riehen and Bettingen.
But this is not the case .The two villages are already well connected to bicycles.In this way, bike can already drive in the upper part of the Wenkenmattweg.
Instead of crossing the park, they can turn into Bettingerstrasse via the Hellring and drive down to Riehen from there - or vice versa.Bettingerstrasse is ideal for bikes, even if it has no bike strips.The speed is signaled at 40 kilometers per hour.
However, since there is a ban on moped in the upper part of the Wenkenstrasse, electrovelos with a yellow number must not happen.These over -bikers therefore take the entire Bettingerstrasse to commute between Riehen and Bettingen.If bicycles from Bettingen have to go to Basel, the path is ideal via the Rudolf Wackernagel-Strasse and the Kohlistieg.
These routes are also well developed, both for cars and for bicycles.Alternatively, to get to Lörrach without a detour, the Hellring could be widened in the north and released for the bike, so the park could be avoided.Parking systems such as the Wenkenmattpark or the Kannenfeldpark in Basel should invite you to stroll and linger for pedestrians.
If such systems are crossed with bicycles or even faster electrovelos, this stresses the pedestrians because their inner calm and the balance is disturbed by the rugging bicycles.The concentration and the sunkenness of the walking person must not be disturbed by the faster means of transport.The authorities should see this and not a fillet piece of urban calm on the altar of “Pro Velo”.

Pro Velo or Pro Populo?/ / The Basel Velo virus has now reached Riehen.The Rieheners should not only be convinced, but forced to provide the Basel bike ideology above anything.
It is not yet enough that the planned bicycle traffic network carries many risks and will bring extreme investments, because this narrow network can only work if countless parking spaces give way to the bike tracks and when neuralgic intersections are converted in terms of transport.Now the most popular footpaths should also be sacrificed?It is said that the path in the Wenkenpark is wide enough for up-to-down and downward traffic if the walkers in the goose torch switch to the side, and there is enough time to pull toddlers or dogs.
With a proper consideration, this is not a problem.The calm and the joy of walking would be there.For what ?
It is no different in the Hohlwegstück of Mohrhaldenstrasse.There is not only a piece of official play street, but many children play on the HA there?ngen, while others run into the village on foot - there would be no different footpath to avoid, very well for Velos!This bicycle rage should be well covered before it ends in chaos.

The first balance sheet falls from / / thun 17,000 times the 135 red rental bikes from Velospot have been loaned in the past year and a half.
For the city of Thun, the balance is through.When Christoph Kupper talks about the lending bike system in Thun, he does not do without relativizing words."The balance is actually good," he says.
And: «We are quite satisfied.»Kupper is project manager at the Thun planning office and responsible for the Velospot.He is satisfied with the rental numbers.
Since the start of Velospot in September 2014, 17,000 trips have been recorded in Thun.In the top months of June, July and August of last year, up to 60 bicycles were loaned per day."The numbers are in the area of the expected," says Kupper.
What the balance sheet is in is the sale of the subscription.Only 450 pieces were sold in the one and a half years."We hoped to have a lot more here," says Kupper.
500 of the day tickets were discontinued.Limited freedom of the rental velos are lively.But from pretty few people.
Several reasons may be responsible for the fact that Velospot is not yet running as the city has imagined: the manageable number of loan stations, the loan concept and the "German -Swiss mentality", as Kupper says.There are currently 25 loan stations in the city area.
Most are in the immediate vicinity of bus stops.In the broadest case 250 meters away.That is wanted:
As a result, the customer can quickly switch from public transport to bike and vice versa.However, anyone who hopes for more freedom through the bike will be disappointed: here, too, the cyclist is bound to the stations.
In order to use the Velospot cheaply, it has to hand over the bike quickly.Only the first half hour is free in the annual subscription.After that, it is billed for the hour.45 locations in Thun "The more stations can be approached, the more attractive the offer will be," says Christoph Kupper.
«If we want more subscribers, we have to invest in stations.»In the previous May, 11 new Velospot locations were added in Thun, the number of bicycles was increased from 84 to 135.The expansion has an impact on demand.
"The number of subscribers has doubled," says Kupper.The city is willing to set up even more stations.«We would like to reach the size of Biel in the medium and long term.»
Today there are 45 loan stations in the mother city of Velospot (see box Velospot).30 to 45 should one day become in Thun.Kupper would also welcome an expansion of the stations beyond the city limits.
So far, the red bikes can only be borrowed and returned in Thun.The distances between the stations are accordingly modest.The longest route leads from the Lerchenfeld playground to the campsite in the Gwatt.
This is less than seven kilometers in the direct path.Steffisburg is interested could extend this route.
"We are convinced of the system and would like to attach ourselves to the network of Thun," says Martin Deiss, head of the Department of Civil Department and the Environment of the municipality of Steffisburg.The community is currently negotiating with Velospot.According to Deiss, 4 to 5 rental stations in Steffisburg are planned.
In Heimberg, the Green Party recently applied to the municipal council to examine the connection to the Thuner Velospot.This is currently underway, says the Heimberg Mayor Niklaus Röthlisberger.You will also contact Thun and Steffisburg.
Christoph Kupper from the city of Thun says that a cross -community organization and logistics is quite feasible.«We have an interest in the communities.»However, there are no plans in this regard in Spiez and Interlaken.
This is what the administrations of the two communities say.A mentality question "We still have to be patient," says Kupper several times.«We cannot orientate ourselves too much on Biel and Neuchâtel.»
The system has already been established in Welschweiz and is asked by many people.«In Germany, on the other hand, it only slowly arises.»The project must therefore be given three to four years.

Biel has therefore started to equip the bicycles with stronger locks, and also installs GPS channels to locate stolen bicycles.So far there has been little experience with vandals in Thun."We have one or two cases in which someone has bothered at the castle of a bike," says Christoph Kupper from the city's planning office.

"We go much further than planned" / / with Filippo Leutenegger Sprachsimon Eppenbergerfilippo Leutenegger, Zurich's civil engineering, defends itself against the accusation of doing too little for bike drivers - with new numbers and surprising solutions.In Zurich there is often a lack of space for Velos.
Now its department is decided by VeloStandards, which falls below the standard of at least 1.2 meters wide.How does that fit the bike promotion that you want to officially want?
The claim is wrong and is not correct by repetition.Our bike standards adhere to the standards.They even go on:
Our minimum width is 1.25 meters.We very much promote bicycle traffic with the continuity of Veloroute, an express team that is looking for opportunities for immediate measures and with new two-wheeler parking spaces.The standard says: 60 centimeters for the handlebar, to the left and right 30 centimeters.
If bicycles and pedestrians meet, the minimum is undercut in Zurich.Even with comfort routes, driving bikes remain on the left and right only 20 centimeters.This scares everyone who doesn't drive very safely.
It is also not the opinion that bikes should drive side by side on bike strips.That is forbidden .Except for overtaking, there are never two bikes side by side.
And there are no pedestrians on bike strips.For comfort routes for inexperienced drivers, we strive for at least 1.5 meters wide wheel strips.If there is enough space, we even go to 1.8 meters, as on the camp street.
The bicycles only perform four to five percent of the traffic performance today.In terms of this, we do a lot for cyclists - but without demonizing and plague unnecessarily without demonizing and unnecessary.Nevertheless: the standard is 1.2 meters.
Zurich cuts this as soon as there is more going on the bike gesture or in mixed traffic.Delightful situations are programmed, not least with e-bikes.Does Zurich promote bike traffic enough?
Again: According to the road traffic law, Velos must not drive side by side.In structurally separated paths, the assessment of the necessary width depends on many factors, for example whether bike paths have to be managed together with footmakers or whether they are only operated in one direction.We have shown everything differentiated.
Our bike standards have also been found by bicycle specialists.Bicycle traffic is not only promoted by width requirements, but also by continuous routes.This is often only possible with minimal masses granted.
Ignoring the space without uncompromising is not constructive.We had planned a standard cycle path downhill on the Stampfenbachstrasse and also a colored band uphill.A wafer -thin majority in the municipal council rejected this and insisted on a maximum ideological variant.
Now we have to renovate the street without biking measures.I very much regret that.It is better not to implement a measure at all than do without the unrealistic maximum: is the bicycle promotion?
The reality in the city center is: many ways suddenly stop.New cyclists are not lured to the street, say critics of Zurich's bike policy.Consistent routes are more important than pounding on maximum variants.
Among other things, we work intensively with our express team.Something else is also central to bike funding: enough two -wheeler parking spaces that are protected from rain and snow.
Here we are now expanding enormously.This was also decided on the bike promotion at the urn.We go much further.
Compared to the first planning, the number of two -wheeler spaces is doubled to 10,000 in ten years.There will be 4,000 covered places alone at the main train station.At the Stadelhofen, I spoke to the architect Santiago Calatrava so that he is planning more space for Velos in his new building.
Now there are not 600, but 1200 places.These numbers are new and should be happy.But if you take a tram or bus out of fear of traffic, it is of little use.
The traffic is tight, and two -wheelers are basically more exposed than other road users, yes, that's the way it is.However, the infrastructure is continuously improved.We also have to think of public and commercial traffic.
New ideas are needed.How do the roller tapes at Rämistrasse?The development of the university district is another topic.
But right below at the Bellevue you can see: everything has been rebuilt, but it has too many road users who want to go through there.From the Limmatquai to the lake shore, for example, you can only get difficult.
Here would be a solution to make space under the Quai bridge.You could improve the narrow underpass at the Bellevue.It even has space between the pillars of today's and the original bridge.
Velos and pedestrians would have such an additional route.An exciting proposal, but no relief in everyday traffic.Of course, more than just an idea is needed.
For traffic nodes, we also have to think outside of the existing patterns, for example at the Escher-Wyss-Platz.It was redesigned a few years ago and is not satisfactory for cyclists.There you could consider an underpass for the bicycles of the Limmat and thus unklove traffic.

Missing à la Copenhagen / / on four connecting axes are said to have passenger drivers in the city of Zurich in the future.With the so -called bike roads, the Limmatstadt northern role models jeopardize.
Fortunately, Irène Troxlerfür's bike in Zurich does not have to (yet) take a exam.
The vocabulary alone would otherwise be buffing up a lot: In addition to the usual yellow wheel strip, according to the will of the red-green majority of the local council, there will be not only main and comfort routes for two-wheelers in the future, but also breeding roads.These are fast routes that the city parliament wants to anchor in the regional structure plan, as it decided on Friday.
Four axles in Riesbach, Oberstrass, Aussersihl-Altstetten and Zurich-Nord are faster and free of charge (see map).The legal advance is lifted on these routes so that the bicycle and e-bike drivers move faster.At the same time, they have progressed to the cars and can drive side by side.
Appropriate projects are also performed in Winterthur and Bern, but one speaks of bicycles.The concept comes from Northern Europe, where such bike main routes have been part of the cityscape for a long time, for example in Copenhagen or Berlin.However, the Zürcher could be more creative when naming:
The Danish “cycle superstent” promises significantly more driving pleasure than the Zurich Velostrasse with its asphalt taste.The bourgeois side was skeptical.It is wiser to first realize the route network of the Masterplan Velo before producing new competitive projects, she said warning.
The Federal Office of Street (Astra) is planning pilot tests with such bike fast connections throughout Switzerland.Zurich should not paint ahead, but simply take part there - at the pace of the Astra and without the execution schedule.As is well known, Zurich has had bad experiences with idiosyncratic signaling of new traffic regimes.
The first Tempo 30 markings had to be reversed for expensive money in the zero years because they did not meet the federal government.The FDP also found the parking spaces that would have to give ways.Despite these objections, the Council was the name of the Velobahn with 71 to 45 votes.
Velo, bicycle and again bike debate was - as usual in traffic issues - all along the ideological fronts.The red-green majority of SP, Greens, AL and GLP performed their applications and in various ways ensured that the structure plan was even more bike-friendly than the-also a bicycle-friendly city council-had already intended.
The planning horizon was shortened in various bicycles and others were re -inserted.Civil engineering head Filippo Menschenegger pointed out in vain that bicycle paths could only be built if a road construction project was pending.The FDP's objection, if you prioritize everything, will also take longer in the end, no hearing.
At the request of Rot-Grün, it is now also in the structure plan that the mass of the bike paths should be "significantly above" the minimum requirements.It is open whether this eradication of any flexibility ultimately serves the bicycles.With the rope beam over the lake and Stadtati Kälin (AK) AK.
· If there is no longer enough space on streets and rails, the traffic must take off.In other cities, cable cars have long been complementing the transport system, but in Zurich the question has never been discussed in detail.The Zurich town council now wants this to change, although the proposal contains a "pinch of planning reckons", as Al-Gemeinderat Niklaus Scherr said.
The Council could no longer be dissuaded from the enthusiasm for cable car, but it was stated that the cable cars were not the solution to all traffic problems.However, they are quite suitable as a supplement to neuralgic points.And if you complain all the time that the structure plan does not contain visions, then you have to support such innovative suggestions, Michael Baumer (FDP.) And Karin Weyermann (CVP.).
The topic is irrelevant because one of the proposed cable car connections will never be realized, said Markus Knauss.In addition, security and fire protection problems arose.And with landscape protection, the projects cannot be reconciled.
Gabriela Rothenfluh (Sp.) Emphasized that whether the cable car should not forget to solve the traffic problems on the ground.Nevertheless, the SP was behind most suggestions.In the end there were different additional and minorities.
The cable car connection across the lake was accepted most clearly, with 101 to 14 votes.There were majorities for the cable cars of Altstetten and Affoltern to the ETH Hönggerberg, the connection from the Tiefenbrunnen to the Balgrist and the extension of the Rigiblick cable car to the Stampfenbachplatz.The route was rejected by the Üetliberg station to Uto Kulm, which would have largely led over the Stalliker area.
Attention plan for a new Zürcher Zeitung (ZZ) no sea tunnel.SVP, FDP and CVP want to close the auto ring around Zurich with a tunnel between the Brunau and Dübendorf in order to reduce city crossing.The application fails with 46 to 73 votes.
No new parking garages.A SVP proposal for new parking garages in the city center also remains without a chance.The party unsuccessfully appeals to the left that it must also be interested in the fact that visitors come to downtown Zurich to shop.
All road tunnels without a chance.In contrast to the bike bobby, the SVP does not bring its suggestions for improvements in motorized traffic.The proposal for lowering the Rämistrasse at the level of the two universities, which is also supported by FDP and CVP, makes the most votes.
This is to relieve the growing university district.With its proposal for two tunnels between Glaubtenstrasse and Europabrücke and between Bucheggplatz and Grünau, the SVP remains alone.Yes to cable cars.
The Council stands behind the idea with different, but a clear majorities to supplement the means of transport in the city with cable cars.The most clearly tourist route is through the lake (see right).The municipal council proposes various adjustments to projects for new tram lines.
The clearest support for the creation of a line in Raubistrasse for the development of the new open-air settlement with 1000 apartments is the clearest.At the time of going to press, the session was still in the corridor.tox./ak.

Budapest rejects Velos / / The mayor of the Hungarian capital orders the dismantling of the bike infrastructure.Bernhard Odehnalbudapestdie many trams, the many buses.
Istvan Tarlos, Mayor of Budapest, does not particularly like public transport.He thinks that the trams prefer and the cars are disadvantaged.However, the city politician are even more contrary to the city politician.
Tarlos therefore issued orders at a non -public meeting of the city government that should make cycling in Budapest significantly more difficult.The opening of one -way streets for bicycles is to be lifted again in both directions.Main streets should no longer be marked with VELO pictograms.
If new cycle paths are still being built, the principle of the shortest route should no longer apply to them.Loudly protesting, these and other measures should have remained secret and should simply be implemented.However, the mayor's orders were admitted to the club of the Hungarian cyclists who published them.
Tarlos wanted to "trace the city to the 1970s," criticized the orders.Budapest would actually be an ideal Velostadt.Most districts are in the flat terrain, the main lines are wide, the distances are not too big.
The semi -annual demonstrations of the Critical Mass bike group are among the largest in Europe.About five years ago, the city administration actually started building bike paths.However, without great expertise and always with the aim of keeping the disabilities for car traffic as low as possible.
This is how new conflict zones always emerged.The Budapesters could still be stopped.Their bicycles are now an integral part of the street, they are means of transportation and not just leisure fun.
Added to this are the rental bikes, which are particularly popular with tourists, which are called “Bubis” in Budapest.Last year, the 1,000 rental bikes were borrowed 650,000 times, so that the responsible Budapest transport association BKK now wants to expand to 3000 bicycles in 225 rental stations.In view of such numbers and the loud protests against his orders, Istvan Tarlos advised not to condemn cyclists in Bausch and Arch.
But to share them in good and evil.He was not against a reasonable development of cycling, the mayor had it notified.But very well against "the uninhibited terror of a radical minority among the cyclists".

Velos keep politics in Trab / / City of Bern
Step by step, the authorities are working on turning Bern a Velostadt.While the first Velohaupstroute is being realized, Parliament will negotiate on the bike bridge tomorrow and the promotion of foot and bike.On the Nordring in the Bernese Lorrainequartier, it becomes visible for the first time these days, which is a Velohaup route.
In the future, one will be realized every year and bicycle travelers along the main traffic axes will enable safe and quick progress.The route through Lorraine connects the train station to the Wankdorf and is to be inaugurated before the summer vacation.The bicycle strips, which are already widened to 2.50 meters, are already visible on the Nordring, on which overtaking is easily possible.
In the same washing up, the Nordring / Breitenrainstrasse / Schulweg intersection for Velos was optimized so that bicycle travelers can turn directly from the Nordring direct to school.With red you can overtake a possible car column and in front of it.
The parliament that granted the loan for the Velohaupstrout will deal with bikes again tomorrow.The planning and project planning loan for the Breitenrain- Länggasse Velo Bridge is aggressive.In order for a specific project to be developed in a competition, a loan approved in 2014 is to be increased by 1.4 to CHF 1.95 million.
Velooffensive is on the course of the course of around CHF 18 million.A minority of the preparatory commission requires rejection because the regulations enact rearing measures: less car traffic, doubling the proportion of bicycles in total traffic to 20 percent.However, contrary to the reduction in commission, this does not violate a superordinate right, according to the Bernese traffic planner Karl Vogel.
«We simply don't see which overarching norms we could have hurt.»A rejection or a no to the revised regulations would not be no to the urban bike offensive, says Vogel.«The regulations must be checked every five years.
But the bike offensive, for which the city council has approved the loan, could also run under the existing regulations. »Christoph Hämmannvom Nordring to the left into the way to school: Instead of getting on the right as before, bicycle travelers can turn back in front of the cars and via medium strips more direct.Urs Baumann bicycle bikes take part in a bicycle street pilot project, tweeted traffic director Ursula Wyss (SP).
Bicycle streets are not to be confused with Velohaupstrouten, says Karl Vogel.«Bicycle streets lead through quarters and bicycles always have ahead.“That means: no progress for cars that come from right.
The attempt in cooperation with the Federal Office of Transport should begin this year.The test track is Beundenfeld- und Military Strasse, and Free and Erlachstrasse are also checked.hae

The Bobby Car Ordinance / in Basel has a tree and, above all, a bike more rights than a citizen.Now politicians want to anchor the bicycle in private houses as legally prescribed luxury space.
By Michael Bahnerthes, this savanna theory, according to which there is an aesthetic preference of man for open, savanna -like landscapes, because people there has spent the child's room of human beings over a few million years.It is difficult to say whether this theory is globally applicable, but it works perfectly in Basel.This is not inconsiderable by the immigrants from the Baselland, this canton, which for a long time was only the grain chamber and a little recreational area of the city.
In the last few years of the years, two things have happened that you can't get past, you want to understand Basel's demise and also the Baselland.In the 1970s, city dwellers moved to the country in the longing for healing world, good air, happy children and idyllic self -fulfillment and still wanted to have a little city there.And for twenty years, these strange townspeople have come back to the city and are tinkering with a rural atmosphere.
Since then, an identity crisis has been rampant in the two cantons because the country is no longer real country and the city is no longer the right city.Three Social Democrats and a greener sit in the Basel government.The Green is a few more months and then steps back, prefers to play high above the roofs of Basel on the brotherwood Bach on the organ, dreams of an ideal world in which everyone loves and is basically harmless.
The difficulty is the three Social Democrats who are preserving the construction, the financial and economic department, those departments that decide on the framework of the city's life and dying.Unfortunately, all three rural roots have and have remained overwhelmed by the urban overwhelmed country dwellers, and so city is simply land for them with less landscape and therefore a way to create a rural city as a second home.Finance Minister Herzog comes from Pratteln BL, the Minister of Economy from Oberwil BL and the Minister of Construction from a suburb of St. Gallen.
You can draw from the full when implementing your field forest meadow visions.Basel has money.There are the Novartis and the Roche that lay the financial basis, there are high taxes.
The city achieved 430 million francs last year, 180 million alone among the natural persons, which is CHF 1400 per tax -paying citizen.The red-green government puts all the money into its projects and gradually makes the city mutate into a non-world biotope.However, what arises is not the city of the future, but a brain clamping.
It should be a city where all bicycles run or use the public transport and in which all the left -wing car owners best park their cars outside of the city limits.The government wants this so much that buyers of box birds, for example, are to be subsidized with CHF 1500 in front or back like an open chest.That is longing;
Master painter Müller comes with the tram or the box bike, and the world has gotten a little better.Special zones for livelihood this policy against common sense can only be enforced by laws and regulations.This is usually not so easy in a direct democracy, there are initiatives, referenders and so on, and above all there is reason, but the enemy of reason is the ideology.
The problem now is that the Basler SP considers its ideology to be sensible and has only all the rural Gutmenschen-Kädter behind them who have made themselves comfortable in cuddly single-family houses on the outskirts and want to prescribe the others how responsible life works.The remaining two thirds of Basel have long since been released from the political design process and are silent from anger and curse citizen to the resignative city.It will soon be the case that all life -affirming activities in public space in Basel are subject to approval because the public space should be untouched like a remote landscape early in the morning.
Life may then only take place on particularly marked life zones in 2015, the city introduced a new traffic regulation because, above all, the third that lives in the city as if it were land, and once a week goes to the city and then completelyFinds terribly alive, voted for a traffic reduction;Ten percent less car traffic until 2020. This is basically not unreasonable, but the red-green government in its unvelvated Safe The World Cross train immediately took the opportunity to radical solution, overturned the lame civil resistance with the concession of one or two new parking garagesAnd then made the city so traffic -free that even corpse cars need a special permit to drive into the city center.
In the meantime, the city is car -free except for a few taxis and police cars, which by the way also brought the little street line to a standstill.It is no longer long, you can assume, and the city installs a meeting zone with parking benches, prohibition signs and rollator storage space.Highing the decadence has long been the case that a tree and especially a bike has more freedom and rights in Basel than a citizen.
Velos and trees receive that space for self -realization that is withheld from the citizens.For bicycles, luxury parking spaces have been built across the past five years, 19,500 in number, almost as many as Basel has.Now the building department wants to bring a new Veloparkplatz Ordinance, for short Veloppv, through the parliament, it is in the consultation.
It is a "regulation on the creation of parking spaces for bicycles, mopeds, strollers and children's vehicles".The business ran on the political level as always.It was by motion to change an old building paragraph, who has always stipulated that buildings and plants with bike parking spaces have to be “equipped”.
Wherever possible, just, and it would be good if the bicycles did not have to be carried into a basement and so on.The old paragraph, however, was only a regulation, and that was obviously not enough.Then a social democrat called by motion to anchor the bicycle as legally prescribed luxury room, and since then the city has been discussing bicycle.
The building department, which is developed by the left -etologically and also designed to the limits of what is feasible and beyond, stipulates that a bike parking space must have the mass of a good 90 centimeter wide and almost two meters in length.Each resident has a parking space for each room plus parking spaces for strollers and bobby cars and the like.Seventy percent of the places are long -term velop parking spaces of the tenants, thirty percent are intended as visitor parking spaces.
And so it will come, the Veloppv, the realm of prescribed bicycle, except in old people, as you can hear.Basel, that is the city with the most beautiful bicycles in the world.Michael Bahnerth is the head of the Basler Zeitung.

New bicycle cars for the canton of Zurich / / The government council presents the Velonetz plan.This provides fast routes for the first time - first in the Limmattal and in Winterthur.
The bike bobby wishes more of it.The Zurich government council has a great hope: he wishes that more people are on the bike in the canton of Zurich.
That is why he presented the new Velonetz plan yesterday.The government wants to close the gaps on the network of bike routes outside of the big cities and make the connections more attractive.The commuters in particular should later drive to work with the bike instead of the car.
Distances up to 15 kilometers should be able to be covered with the bike in the future.The network plan developed by the Cantonal Coordination Center Velo -Transport is a centerpiece of the Velo Förder program decided by the cantonal council in 2010.He provides to position the bike as an important means of transport next to the car and public transport.
In addition to smaller connections, the plan also provides bicycle routes.The one pilot project for the “Velo Autobahn” takes place in the Limmattal: from Schlieren station to the Zurich city limits.The route is short, but optimal to test a route, it says at the Office of Transport.
Commissioning was planned at the end of 2017.There is a similar project in the city of Winterthur.15 million francs per year. The implementation of the Velonetzplan is now creating a cantonal concept that prioritizes and laces the measures to packages.The government council writes.
The municipalities would be included in the planning of the measures.The Velonetz plan should be implemented in such a way that it does not lead to an additional burden on the state budget.According to the road law, the canton is already obliged to invest at least CHF 15 million in the Veloweg network annually.
The organization Pro Velo Kanton Zurich is pleased with the new bike strategy.However, she finds that the government council is far too reserved in the bicycle routes and should move forward faster.(Ta) Ta /

Direct paths for Velopendler / / The bicycle paths in the canton of Zurich should lead to the goal faster.The government's supplementary network plan also contains pilot projects for quick routes.
Stefan Hotzda's Veloweg Netz in the canton of Zurich has been used more to be used for leisure traffic.This function should continue to fulfill it.With the new network plan, however, the government council is changing a change in philosophy.
Now gaps are closed and attractive connections are created, especially in the agglomerations.The bike is to be used more often in everyday life.The main target group are commuters who use it on the way to work, training facilities and for shopping for distances up to 15 kilometers.
The bike copes with motorized private transport (MIV) and public transport (public transport) 2 to 4 percent of the total amount.The network plan developed by the Cantonal Coordination Center Velo -Transport is a core of the Velo Förder program decided in 2010.There are three categories in this: · side connections are continuous, safe bicycle paths, which largely include the basic network of today along the cantonal roads.
They are created for a bike per direction of travel.In urban areas, bike strips are the rule on both sides, outside the cycling and sidewalks.They are led away from the main traffic axes to avoid interruptions at street crossings.
Here two bicycles should be able to cross an oncoming two -wheeler so that it is easier to overtake.According to a report by the Federal Office of Roads (Astra), which uses the name Velobahn for this, they are characterized by the following properties: they allow an interruption -free journey, are comfortable, safe and have a high design quality.
Up to two bicycles should be able to run on them per direction of travel;Driving side by side is explicitly allowed.The canton plans fast routes if their feasibility and a sufficient cost-benefit ratio have been proven.
A pilot project is planned in the Limmattal between Altstetten and Dietikon.It is included in the new agglomeration program for the region, which enables co -financing by the federal government with 30 to 40 percent.For fast routes, an adjustment of the signaling regulation and the traffic regulation regulation at the federal level is necessary.
For this purpose, the Astra tests carry out tests in several Swiss cities.In Zurich, according to the traffic department, traffic at the earliest from autumn in the north (Affoltern- and Zelglistlistrasse between Birch- and Binzmühlestrasse) and in district 6 (Scheuchzerstrasse from Sonnegg to Irchelstrasse) will take place.Similarly to the main streets, bike routes fall into the competence of the big cities.
Zurich plans two other quick connections in Seefeld and in Altstetten, Winterthur also several, starting with the connection Hegi - Grüze.The cities' intentions are coordinated with the cantonal velonetz plan.This remained comparatively undisputed in the consultation.
A discussion point was leisure routes in recreation areas, for example the Oberländer Höhenweg Russikon - Bäutetswil - Wald.The canton first wanted to hit her to the local network according to its new direction.At the request of the municipalities, however, they now remain in the cantonal velonetz plan.
In order to implement this, the necessary measures will be prioritized and put together into packages.In the future, bicycles in the canton of Zurich should get their destination more quickly thanks to the interruption -free routes.Goran Basic / NZZ «The Velo can make an important contribution» Economic director Carmen Walker Späh on the new bike strategy of the Zurich government councilor Hotz (Sho)
In bike policy, the canton puts weight on everyday traffic.Why is that important ?This is a paradigm change.
All modes of transport have their advantages and disadvantages and result in a whole.Bicycle traffic is part of it.You can't see it as a leisure traffic.
The bike has a comprehensive function as an everyday vehicle.That is why we now give him the due place as an equivalent means of transport alongside all others.However, the lion's share will continue to be omitted on the MIV and public transport.
What are the advantages of the bike?It is practical, quiet, environmentally friendly, promotes health and saves space.Statistically speaking, bicycle traffic needs less space than the MIV and about the same amount of space as the public transport.
He has a lot of potential in the densely populated room.Do you hope to smooth the traffic peaks in the morning and evening?This expectation plays with.
50 percent of the car journeys are less than 5 kilometers, 60 percent to 9 kilometers, 70 percent of the tram and bus trips in the city remain under 3 kilometers.The bike can step in there.Is there an idea of the proportion of bicycle traffic?
The government has refrained from specifying goals in numbers in the Velonetz plan.We want to increase the proportion and precede in Swiss comparison.Years ago there was a requirement of the cantonal council for increasing the bike content of total traffic to 8 percent by 2015.
I think that can be a goal.It is ambitious, but goes in the right direction.The expansion of the bike paths needs space.
How do you want to avoid conflicts?In urban areas, of course, there are conflicts of goals.We have to tackle this pragmatically and find solutions that are feasible and maintain the function of all modes of transport.
An important topic is the cultural country.Velor routes in rural areas need additional land areas.This is one of the critical points around the implementation of the cultural initiative.
The canton now also relies on bicycle routes.This is completely new.In addition to the Limmattal, where we drive a pilot project, the routes Wetzikon - Zurich and Winterthur - Effretikon are planned.
The government decided not to create bicycle routes across the board.We first want to gain knowledge with pilot projects.Do you have considerations of what benefits the necessary investments bring?
Economic considerations are only possible for individual sections, not for the entire network.Due to the potential analysis made, the cost-benefit ratio can be estimated in order to be able to implement an eye.There is no additional burden on the state budget, we do this as part of the means that we have in the street fund.
According to the road law, these are around CHF 15 million annually.In earlier years we did not exhaust this.With the network plan we can work strategically and achieve the goals.
The consultation was surprisingly quiet.Did you expect that?We developed the plan together with the municipalities and regions, not in the quiet closet.
Individual regions have already anchored stipulations in their execution plan.That was a democratic process.The template is supported, which makes me positive.
For once, it did not open the usual traffic policy trenches, but you went to work impartially.The government council has now decided on a specific network plan.Before that, there were only guidelines of the offices.
Zurich is probably the first canton to be a bike path strategy across the board that focuses on everyday traffic.I would like to emphasize again: the car and public transport will remain the main bearers, but the bike can make an important contribution to mobility.

Without a stop and almost almost to the train station / / Velohaup route since yesterday Bern has his first bicycle route.
A continuous bike is now running on both streets between Wankdorf and the train station, and bicycles have green wave during the shock times.Three kilometers, more than a dozen traffic lights: the journey from Wankdorf to Bern train station is almost inevitably shaped by many breaks.
Most of all, the stop at the bottom of the Nordring hurts, where cyclists come around in the city with a lot of momentum."A lot of energy is destroyed at this traffic light," says Bern's traffic planner Karl Vogel.This should be over now .
Yesterday, Vogel opened the first Bernese Velohauptroute together with his boss, traffic director Ursula Wyss (SP).During the pushing times, the route is switched along the traffic lights so that cyclists can hope for a green wave.In the morning, this applies inland, at the end of the day for commuting the city at the end of the day, and at an average pace at the flat sections of 20 kilometers per hour.
This applies to two months during two months, during which the urban traffic planners evaluate whether this pace fits most bike travelers.The route cost around CHF 1.8 million.Because the federal government and the canton take part in it with 55 percent, the city treasury accounted for CHF 780,000.
Up to 3.50 meters wide on main traffic axes without an interruption is just a criterion that has to meet a Velohaup route."It should run in the right place, be quick, attractive and above all safe," said Ursula Wyss in front of the media.
It is the most visible change between Wankdorf and the train station, and probably also those who are most likely to bring new people to the bike - because it ensures more security: a continuous bicycle is now marked on both streets.In the most bike -friendly places, it is 3.50 meters wide on the narrowest 1.50 meters.
The most important improvements are reached along the Schützenmatt and on the parking street, where there was no bicycle. ”The lorraine bridge remains to be stammered” Pièce de Résistance, which is classified by many as a dangerous bike route.As before, the bicycle is 1.50 meters wide there, and inland there are still cross-maneuvers between bicycle and car travelers who want to turn right at the end of the bridge.In order to make this section more bike -friendly, the city wants to lift a car trail in 2018.
This will no longer lead to no more traffic jams, Vogel's asserted traffic planner.The regime on the nodes is decisive for the flow of traffic, not the number of traces.The green wave for bicycles is also not disadvantageous for the other road users.
"Because the traffic lights have not yet been perfectly coordinated, the situation is better for everyone," said Vogel.This was shown by simulations that his office had carried out.The city gave binding guidelines to reduce the car share of traffic and noise pollution, said Wyss.
Urban traffic policy is "very differentiated" and does not aim to banish the car from the city.She mentioned the “business traffic”, which is important for a living city.In principle, car traffic should be "channeled".
The city wants to open a new Velohauptraute every year radially and in future.In planning for 2017, a route is mainly connected via Schwarzenburgstrasse Bern and Köniz.By 2030, eleven such radial routes are intended that lead from the center to outside quarters.
There are also one or two tangent routes, which include the foot and bike bridge between Breitenrain and Länggasse.In the controversial project, Parliament approved a loan in May so that specific projects can be developed in a competition.Christoph Hämmannvelo, bus and MIV side by side:
City councilor Ursula Wyss and traffic planner Karl Vogel opened the first Bernese Velohauptraute yesterday and drove across the Nordring together.Beat Mathysvelo offensive is allowed to go with the bike offensive with the velo offensive, the city wants to double the proportion of bike in overall traffic by 2030.
Yesterday the public participation process was heralded in the Wankdorf.According to the municipal management for civil engineering, traffic and city green (TVs), over 100 people from politics, transport and business had registered for this.With public participation, the intended measures are to be evaluated and broadly supported.
In the next few months, topics such as the main routes, planned sensitization measures, bike parking spaces or bicycle experiences of tram stops will be discussed in workshops.The city does not want to force anyone to bike with its offensive, said Ursula Wyss yesterday.However, surveys know that the city has the potential for doubling - if it offers safe bike routes.

Veloschnellroute yes, but not so / / finally politics discovered that the bike is also used as a means of transport in everyday life and not only in leisure time (NZZ 24. 6. 16).It should now receive a place as an equivalent means of transport in addition to the MIV (motorized private transport) and the public transport.
For this purpose, breeding routes are also introduced to the existing bike compounds.In Zurich, a test track is to be set up on the Affoltern and Zelglistlassen between the Birch and the Binzmühlestrasse in order to check the feasibility.This oldest connection from new-affolter to Oerlikon is the only street free from through traffic.
As a one -way street, entered in the city map as a bicycle path, partly provided with a one -sided sidewalk, it also serves those road users who have not yet been assigned a proper share of the volume of traffic with the means of transport of the shoes.A bicycle route with the desirable properties becomes on the narrow street, on which the previous bike traffic and pedestrians, who are side by side with children's and shopping carts, trottinettes, roller boards and even with rollers, also have no space.At both ends of this 1.2 km long route you get back into the patchwork of the city strip of the city of Zurich.
It is still open whether the Veloweg has proven itself under the Oerlikon train station.It will never be a bicycle route.If you want to reach the main target group of commuters, the bike route must be set up on the Binzmühlestrasse.

Free travel for Velo / / similar to Copenhagen or Munich, a veritable bike culture is also to be established in Bern.A national initiative is aimed in the same direction.
But there is also resistance.Valerie Zaslawski, Berndie City of Bern has a vision: she wants to become a bicycle capital of Switzerland.
Basel is currently adorned with this title;Nowhere else in this country are as many cyclists on the way as in the Rheinstadt.In order to achieve the self -declared goal, the Bernese municipal council wants to increase the share of bicycle in city traffic from 11 to 20 percent in 2030.
Over a hundred smaller and larger measures are said to help the bike offensive to break through.The first steps have already been taken: At the beginning of March of this year, the Bicycle Boardation Schanzenpost opened at the train station, which includes a thousand new places.At the end of June, the inauguration of the first Velo main route between the Wankdorf stadium and the Bern train station followed.
From now on there is more space for two -wheelers on the “Highway”, and during the shock times a green wave ensures that the traffic lights progress.In the near future, an entire network of such bicycle routes is to be created.The population should be started with the end of June, a process of participation, which should last until 2017.
It is about interdisciplinary cooperation within the administration and the inclusion of the population, all representatives of interests, political parties and neighborhood organizations.Such participatory aspects have already been the key to success in other bike cities such as Copenhagen or Munich, on which Bern is oriented.In order to be able to carry out the process, the city council approved a loan of CHF 750,000 at the request of the local council.
The costs for the other measures are covered by a regulations that provide traffic planning 1.25 million francs annually.Another half a million is planned for "Directorate -specific projects".-FDP National Councilor Christian Wasserfallen, which will take over the Presidium of the Switzerland (ACS) automotive club in the future, sees no advantage in the millions that Bern invests in bicycle traffic.
"We simply have no traffic problem in the urban area," he says, who has been cycling since childhood.The objective is wrong;The population was to be rewinded with large investments.
It is about pure ideology: "While a red carpet is interpreted, the car is demonized." However, according to traffic director Ursula Wyss (sp.) It is about an "overall traffic concept" that bike and drivers do not want to play against each other."We do not make a pure bike policy," said the municipal councilor.The bike offensive is "in the context of urban development".
It is about the quality of the public space, which is increased.The way we are on the way is a question of a place from an urban planning point of view."We are grateful for everyone who moves by bike." Basically, the prerequisites for a bike culture in the Aarestadt are good:
The paths are short, and bike is often the fastest means of transportation in inner -city traffic.The height differences are also relatively easy to manage.But Wyss adds: "Bern lacks a matter of course for bike rides." However, there is not only a bike culture in Bern:
Awareness of the two-wheeler must be strengthened throughout Switzerland, the Freiburg SP National Councilor Jean-François Steiert, who also presides the national umbrella organization Pro Velo Switzerland.While you can easily sit on the bike in other European cities in a suit to ride to work, at best you will be looked at in this country like a "strange exotic".The bike must again become part of the Swiss traffic culture.
Tempo and comfort are important because of the lack of infrastructure, families or older people felt unsafe, says Steiert.The high risk of accidents is one of the most mentioned reasons for the bike waiver.In addition to security, speed and comfort also played an important role - to get from A to B quickly and conveniently, that is the goal of Mr. and Mrs. Schweizer.
The dynamics that is shown in the city of Bern or in the canton of Zurich, where a pilot project is also used on bike rapid routes, shows that you are on the right track.But Steiert still sees potential.For this reason, Pro Velo Switzerland launched the non-partisan “bike initiative” in March, according to which the federal government is supposed to drive bike support and, last but not least, support the cantons, cities and private organizations-in the same way as hiking.
The Federal Council would like to take the request into account with a direct counter -proposal.Steiert is convinced: «The initiative hits the nerve of time.“The trend is clear:
Unlike in the 1970s, when the bike had to struggle with a bad reputation as a means of transportation, a good bike was prestige today.Other social factors speak for a bike culture: While the health feeling is greater, the undeveloped space becomes smaller.
But here too: water traps do not share this opinion - at least as far as Bern is concerned.«Do you have density stress?" , he asks ."Then they drive to relax through the city center of Bern." On the right track: the bike funding in Switzerland.

Something is happening when it comes to promoting bicycle: cities like Bern, but also at federal level, are launched in red-green cities like Bern.As part of an federal pilot project, it is currently being examined whether the introduction of so -called bicycle streets, as they already exist in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Austria, would also be useful in Switzerland.However, these bicycle streets are not to be confused with the Velo main route opened in the Aarestadt at the end of June.
From July 2016 to September 2017, the cities of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Lucerne, St. Gallen, St. Gallen and La Chaux-de-Fonds test the routes marked with two meters tall.Have a preceding over other vehicles - even if they come from right.Bicycles are also allowed to drive side by side.On the bicycle streets, cyclists should get their destination faster and safer.

Velo development country Switzerland / / / an evaluation shows that the Velo transport means is about the same meaning in Switzerland as in Romania and Slovakia.However, the Bundesrat goes too far.
He develops a counter -proposal.Felix Schindler, text Isabella Ballarin, graphic bike drivers are very high in the favor of funding for politics: the cities of Zurich and Bern want to build new bicycle paths for dozens of millions of francs and double the number of bicycle trips.
Lucerne has also decided on a funding program.The Federal Office of Strasse is currently carrying out tests with bike routes in six cities, on which the legal advance no longer applies.Now the Federal Council wants to get involved in the bicycles.
He works on a counter -proposal to the bike initiative, which was submitted in March.But how big is the need to catch up in Switzerland?A comparison with the 28 EU countries shows that about as much bike is driven in this country as in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Romania or Slovakia.
This shows an evaluation that the TA carried out with the statistical office of the canton of Zurich.The basis for this is data from the EU Commission and the European Cyclists' Association (ECF), which are compared to the Swiss survey “Mikrozensus Mobility and Transport” for the first time. 7 to 8 percent of Swiss are often bike.
This is less than the average of the 28 EU countries (8.3 percent).The importance of bicycle traffic is also significantly lower in Switzerland than in Germany (12 percent).The local bike castles are Basel-Stadt (19 percent) and Winterthur (approximately 16 percent).
In the city of Bern, around 14 percent often run bike, in Zurich around 8 percent, less than 4 percent and around 2 percent in Ticino.In 2015, 39 cyclists died on Swiss streets;14 of them were on an e-bike.
That is ten times less than in Germany, but compared to the proportion of frequent drivers, the risk of dying on Swiss streets is greater than in Germany.The best way to do Luxembourg in this ECF ranking list, where in 2009 a person last died in a bike accident.5 to 6 deaths per 100,000 frequent drivers occur in Switzerland.
By far the most dangerous country for cyclists is Portugal.When buying only in the midfielder ECF- «Cycling Barometer», the importance of bicycle traffic also measures consumer behavior-in an area in which Swiss are otherwise top.In 2015, 323,000 bicycles were sold in Germany, 20 percent of them e-bikes.
This is 39 bicycles per 1000 inhabitants.In 16 EU countries, more bicycles per inhabitant are discontinued, in Slovenia the sales rate is three times as high in Denmark.However, this should be because the market is saturated in Switzerland.
70 percent of households have at least one bike.Switzerland in midfield: no everyday position for the country, which occupies top positions in all possible ranking.The reasons for the modest bike content of overall traffic emerge from an evaluation of the Canton of Zurich in 2015.
The more mountainous the terrain, the less bike is driven.In Zurich, almost twice as many people ride bicycles in flat areas as in hilly.However, the rapidly growing number of e-bikes (plus 70 percent since 2010) could break this trend.
In addition, two thirds of the cyclists are good weather drivers;You leave your bike in the basement in winter.Here countries such as Finland and Sweden show that the bike content can be higher despite hard winters than in Switzerland.
Point deduction due to bicycle menuming is the influence of bike hems on the desire to cycle.According to the opponents of the helmet, they use little to nothing, but stigmatize cycling as dangerous activity and keep people from climbing bike at all.The Danish Velobotabelter Mikael Colville-Andersen publishes an index of the cyclist-friendly cities.
In it, a high helmet strap rate leads to a point deduction.Colville-Andersen's logic: The more cyclists wear a helmet, the worse the feeling of security in a city.In fact, there are studies that demonstrate falling bike drivers with an increasing helmet trag odds.
However, the most mentioned comes from 1997 and examined the situation in the UK.Almost half of all cyclists wear a helmet in Switzerland - and according to a Pro Velo study, it is not actually certain.In particular, because bike paths are missing or blocked, cars overtake with little distance, other road users refuse to advance or are difficult to pass.
According to the bike bobby, there is above all a reason for the deep bike content: too often there is no space for cyclists between car columns, ÖV-trassees and sidewalk.Veloinitiative Association is supposed to
Promoting Veloinitiative requires that the federal government will promote and coordinate “attractive and safe networks” in the future.A similar constitutional article already exists for foot and hiking trails, but it is formulated without obligation.The Federal Council goes too far that this will now become an obligation.
However, he considers a greater commitment in the field of bicycle paths to "fundamentally and functional", which is why he develops a counter -proposal.To break traffic tips, the bike is helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption and to promote health, the Federal Council says.According to a study by the University of Zurich, doubling the bike ride would bring an economic benefit of CHF 2 billion.
According to Christoph Merkli, Managing Director of Pro Velo, the constitutional article would enable the federal government to make fundamental considerations of bike funding, as is done in Germany and Holland.Behind the initiative are associations such as VCS, WWF, teacher association, Pro Juventute and Pro Natura.It is supported by SP, Greens, GLP and EVP.
(FXS) FXS / Schindler Felixmethodik comparisons. Only a limited extent today does not exist that compares the importance of bicycle traffic in Switzerland with the European countries.
The EU inquires in the "Eurobarometer" which means of transport the participants "most common on a typical day".The European Cyclists Association compares this data in the “Cycling Barometer” to the number of accidents of all EU countries.Switzerland does not appear as a non-EU country.
In Germany, traffic behavior in the “Mikrozensus Mobility and Transport” is determined.The question is asked about the choice of means of transport on a deadline - not on a "typical day".This makes international comparisons difficult.
For the TA, the statistical office of canton of Zurich determined the proportion of people who led at least half of their path stages by bike (4.9 percent).The data was collected in 2010, but the bike content has hardly changed since 1994.For the Eurobarometer, the bike content is an average of 1.5 times higher for methodological reasons.
This is shown by comparisons from countries that use both methods.Therefore, the Swiss numbers were corrected by this factor here.(FXS)

Excitement for Velostrasse / / five Swiss cities test bike streets.The project in Lucerne is controversial.
Michael Soukupende July announced the Federal Office of Strassen (Astra) to check the introduction of bicycle streets based on the model of Holland.Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zurich take part in the corresponding pilot tests.The tests are necessary because other traffic rules apply on the bike breeds:
Velos always have progress and are allowed to drive side by side.In Zurich, the attempt should start in autumn, as the traffic department of the city of Zurich's police department is said to be on request.The Scheuchzer and Affolternstrasse are intended for this.
Bern will carry out an attempt from September.Basel, St. Gallen and Lucerne have already launched their projects in the past few weeks - with the introduction of the bike street of a small revolution in central Switzerland.Lucerne has informed the affected neighborhood associations, wrote a media release, placed entries on Facebook and set up information boards on site.
But when the new traffic regime came into force on August 1st, some Lucerne were still perplexed.The regional online portal “Zentralplus” even worried about peace on Lucerne's streets in view of the stark discussions in the comment columns and social media.In the local edition of “20 minutes”, a violent discussion under the readers about alleged “Velo-Rowdys” and the “left-wing green dictatorship” broke out.
The responsible civil engineering office told the TA that many positive feedback and some critical voices were received.The almost two -kilometer route was well chosen.It runs parallel to the main roads and is already the fastest bike connection between the western suburb of Kriens and Emmen in the north.
In addition, there has been 30 pace for a long time. The yellow Velopicograms on the street and the new traffic signal «Velostrasse» are new.The legal advance and the previous signals “No advance” and “stop”.After the end of the pilot phase in September 2017, the federal government decides whether bike breeds should be possible throughout Switzerland.

Political blog bicycles are rowdys against will / / blogs.tageceiger.chfelix Schindlerman can divid the Swiss population into two groups: those who drive bike - and those who get upset about cyclists.Every political advance, every campaign and every article about bike funding seems to provoke a defense reflex in the second group.
The central argument in the debate is always the same: cyclists do not adhere to the rules;Under no circumstances should this be rewarded with multi -million dollar investments.
In fact, cyclists drive on the sidewalk and red.And yes, you sometimes become a plague or even a security risk for others.None of this is a reason against bike funding, but for it.
Bicycles do not have a worse character by nature.Their bad sides are only revealed more often.Almost the entire traffic area is either reserved for pedestrians and public transport or is dominated by drivers.
All of these road users have continuous and cleanly separated transport networks, on which they come quickly and safely from A to B.In between there are occasionally 125 centimeters of bicycle path, but mostly there is no getting through on the right side of the road.Bicycles drive bicycles because it enables a quick movement.
If your own intentions collide with the laws - and that should not be justification - people tend to interpret rules more generously.Bike drivers, for example, when they switch to the sidewalk.Drivers do it by parking your car in the parking ban, driving much faster than allowed when overtaking or always driving 10 km / h too fast on the highway.
And pedestrians when they take the shortest path across the street instead of the legal.If you think about whether bike promotion could reduce conflicts, you have to know the following: Every second car ride is shorter than five kilometers - a distance that can be created with the bike in 15 minutes.Nothing is transported in the majority of these trips.
And only one person sits in the car for 90 percent of all ways of working.Some have to drive a car.Others want.
But for many it is simply a nuisance to stand in traffic.Unproductive time that would rather be spent with family or friends.If there were an alternative that would be comfortable, safe and cheap, you would change.
There are now two options: either we build comfortable and safe bike routes so that every mode of transport can play out his strengths.The train for long trips, tram and bus for short -haul routes, the car for transports and the bike as the fastest means of transport on short stages.
This creates space on the street, for those who need it.Or we don't do anything.Then the 600,000 everyday bike drivers will eventually change and clog away streets, trams and buses.

The bike is said to use the bike in the constitution / / in Switzerland.The government agrees to the direction of the “Velo Initiative”, but wants to be able to freely decide on the extent of the funding.
For.Bern · In Holland, Denmark and Sweden, the bike is very important.
There are - for example in Copenhagen - quick trains for Velos to the city center.In some places, cyclists have progress in road traffic.The well -developed infrastructure is a reason for the popularity of the bike in these countries, the cheap topography is different.
In Switzerland, on the other hand, there is still a lot of potential in the bike.This is also evident in the use of how an evaluation in the “Tages-Anzeiger” recently showed.In Holland (36 %), Denmark (23 %) and Sweden (17 %), the proportion of the population who regularly runs bike is much higher than in Switzerland (8 %). The Federal Council also sees potential.
Almost every second car ride and 80 percent of all bus and tram trips are shorter than 5 kilometers.The strength of the bicycle is up to 5 kilometers (e-bike: 7 kilometers).The government therefore supports the fundamental equality of bicycle traffic with foot traffic and hiking, as the broadly supported “bike initiative” demands.
In their committee, politicians from SP via GLP and CVP to FDP are represented.However, because the Federal Council does not want to undergo any coercion in promoting bicycle traffic, it rejects the initiative and instead presents a direct counter -draft at a constitutional level.The government set the corner values before the summer holidays (NZZ, June 11, 16), on Wednesday it sent the draft into the questioning.
Bicycle transport makes a contribution to the Federal Council to break traffic tips-as well as to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.More exercise also has a positive effect on health, the government writes in the report on the counter -draft.The prerequisite for this are nationwide, attractive and safe everyday road networks for foot and bicycle traffic.
However, there are still deficits in particular.While the number of killed and seriously injured decreases for the other transport companies, it has remained constant with the bike drivers and even increased by e-bike drivers.According to the Federal Council, bike is therefore perceived as unsafe, which has led to the fact that children and adolescents have been traveling less and less often with the bike in recent years.

That the car -friendly city does not exist - we don't have to argue about it.But at most about whether the bike should become the measure of all things in the mostly narrow, hilly Swiss cities.Of course, necessary additions should be carried out in the Velonetz, especially in the flat agglomeration belt.
But compare with Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Vienna or Berlin, even if a Danish bike expert sees it differently: in these largely flat cities there is simply a lot more traffic area.But above all: man has two feet and is primarily pedestrian - and of course also users of public mass transport.
It is important to promote this city pedestrian and to maintain its paths, which he has to share with rolling movement.Peter Anderegg, Dübendorf municipalities have failed.You can really ask yourself what the federal government should have to do with it.
Unfortunately, it is the case that the municipalities have failed for decades to provide correct bicycle path networks.Unfortunately, Zurich is a good example for this.Especially when you look at the absurd patchworks on the cantonal streets.

It will be close to Zurich's bike road / / / Zurich is not a paradise for cyclists.New bicycle paths are only hesitantly realized.
Now the city threatens to miss the connection in a nationwide pilot project: Because it has tackled the planning for two bicycle streets in Zurich-Nord too slowly.Five Swiss cities are involved in the pilot, which the Federal Office of Street (Astra), the Velokonferenz Switzerland and the advice center for accident prevention coordinate: Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zurich.
The experiments should run by September 2017 at the latest.Bicycle streets should enable quick and safe progress in the quarters.In principle, a bicycle road is a clear street, which, in contrast to the usual regime, is entitled to a way over the convergent regime.
According to Astra, they have proven their worth in Germany, Austria and Holland.Basel, Lucerne and St. Gallen have already started, Bern will soon start.Zurich only published the new traffic regime for the two test sections last week.

How the bike Zurich changes / / young cultural researcher at the University of Zurich have taken on one topic that does not let any cold in Zurich: the bike - and what it stands for.Marius Huberder Velokurier is the city's cowboy.

Strong, efficient, ruthless, stubborn.And above all: he always finds a way.Who else should you ask how to get through Zurich by bike the fastest?
Through a city that often remained a difficult to deciphery even experienced cyclists?This is exactly what Jessica Huber did, a master student of the popular cultures at the Institute for Social Anthropology and Empirical Cultural Studies at the University of Zurich.She did an experiment with drivers of the courier company Veloblitz.
These had to draw a kind of card sketch, as they get to the main train station from their base on Hardstrasse.Many fastest Wegeda's surprising result: Although the pace in this profession has an impact on salary, there are as many different "fastest ways" as bike.One justified his route choice by district 4 with the fact that he grew up there and therefore feel more comfortable on these streets.
Another emphasized that the fastest way was usually not the most direct.He only uses the narrow long road, for example, "if there is really no other way".He prefers to take the crept paths, where there is less traffic so that he can accelerate.
Most of the time he starts without a fixed plan and decisions.The conclusion of the cultural researcher: Due to their experiences, the bicycle comes to solutions that do not necessarily follow the topographical logic.Older drivers choose different routes than their young colleagues.
Depending on where you have identified suitable traffic light phases, good asphalt or easily to be crossed.Or where they had negative experiences with broken glass who lying on the streets around the main station at the weekend.The study on the bike is part of an almost 200 -page book that illuminates Zurich's bicycle cultures from a social science perspective.
The editors Yonca Krahn and Bernhard Tschofen assume that the bike experiences a renaissance in urban milieu, which points far beyond its practical benefits.The bike has become a sign in the city: for economic and political attitudes, for an idea of environmental and socially compatible coexistence.It is a “vehicle of social changes”. This trace follows the young researchers in the book by examining various scenes and focal points.
What a bike says about its users illustrate 15 short portraits of Zurichers and their favorite bike - from trendy fixie to the work horse.This entire range also shows a reading of two bike transactions worth reading: here is the designer boutique, which satisfies the desire for individuality with expensive products.There the workshop that sells uses of use and oversleep trends.
The readability of the contributions often suffers from the sociologist jargon, with which the authors sometimes protrude banal knowledge.Nevertheless, reading is worthwhile - if only because of the multi -layered approach to the topic, which is previously unique.And because of the resulting knowledge of how terribly simplifying the talk of the "bike driver" is.

The starting signal for Zürcher Velostrassen / / Zurich threatened to connect the most important nationwide Velo pilot project and thus cement its reputation as a tedious city for bike drivers.A single resident could have prevented everything with an objection.
Now the mutual period has been through and no objection has been received.The city announced yesterday that the ten-month attempt will start next Monday in Scheuchzerstrasse and in Affoltern-/Zelglistlistrasse (between Birch and Binzmühlestrasse).All vehicles always have progressed on these streets - except for pedestrians and footminners in crosswalks.
The legal invicing for the accusing vehicles are therefore lifted.Due to the new traffic rules, tests are necessary and also subject to approval.So that road users also notice the new traffic rules, there is a new signaling.
The aim of Velostrasse is to promote traffic safety and bike traffic.No parking spaces have to be lifted.Five cities take part in the federal pilot project: Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zurich.

Zurich's new Velostrasse in the test / / The city started its pilot project of a bike street.A test drive shows that the route also has its pitfalls.
Anita Merktals we arrive at the new Zurich Velostrasse, workers have just painted the last of around 20 oversized velopicograms on the road.At the beginning of the Scheuchzerstrasse in district 6, the blue and white sign "Velostrasse" is now attached.A blackboard underneath explains what it is all about: If you drive along the Scheuchzerstrasse, you no longer have to grant a legal advance.
White shark teeth and guns of right of way, the bending road users draw attention to this.Scheuchzerstrasse has been signposted as a bike street since Monday.
Today Wednesday, the Affolternstrasse in Oerlikon is marked.The TA tested how quickly and safely you drive as a cyclist on Scheuchzerstrasse.As part of a nationwide pilot project, the city tests the two bike roads for ten months.
Since the Scheuchzerstrasse is a 30 zone and all drive slowly anyway, the changeover for the vehicle drivers coming from the right does not seem to be a problem.They slowly approach, look to the right and left and only go off when no bike is doing.Even with cold bise, that's quite a few.
The Scheuchzerstrasse has been a bicycle path so far and is used intensively.It becomes critical of the busy Riedlistrasse.Nothing indicates that the Velostrasse ends here.
Mispers still have to stop.Since it is strictly uphill here, it is relatively easy.A note would still be good.
The Velostrasse is interrupted from here.Once you have crossed the Riedlistrasse, the following applies as before right to the left.Only at Röslistrasse does a sign point back to the new bike street.
Two critical cross -roads are long wall and milk hinge.Here I prefer to drive carefully and see if the crossing cars stop.At least on the inauguration day there is no one who drives through habitually, the new signs are respected.
It will probably take a while until the bike drivers rely on it and maintain a quick pace on the new Velostrasse.Video The new project in the test velostrasse.tägesanzeiger.chunterweg on the test track: the Velostrasse on the corner of Scheuchzerstrasse / Sonneggstrasse.

"Freeches are not comfortable in Basel" / / by Serkan, and Mischa Hauswirthbaz: Mr. Chrétien, why does the city of Basel absolutely need this bicycle?Roland Chrétien: We at Pro Velo see the following in the results of our surveys:
There are a number of people who have the need to be able to drive on safe driving routes for bicycles in cities.Veloring is designed that bicycles can quickly drive from A to B.Isn't that already today?
This is not primarily about speed, but about comfort.So about the personal feeling of security of the respective bicycle driver.This should and can be increased with the ring because there are fewer external impairments for the cyclist.
Compared to real bike cities, it is not easy to drive bike in Basel.Unsafe bicycle travelers feel uncomfortable, they have to reorient themselves at all corners and feel pressed by traffic around them.Driving in Basel is currently not a comfortable affair.
And that is exactly what should change.Opponents of the project refer to Veloring as an expensive “luxury project”.Couldn't you use these costs for more sensible things?
For example for the discount of the health insurance premiums of medium -sized companies?In my opinion, Basel has done more and more for the cyclist than, for example, the Basel area.And this also pays off:
We have a comparatively large amount of bike in the city.Velo traffic does not pollute the air, the streets are worn out less quickly.So added value is created here.
And if we want to compare costs, we can do it with the costs that car traffic and public transport have.However, the roads pay the drivers with the fuel taxes.How much the driver really pays to the road construction is not clear.
What about security?Doesn't the Veloring mean that there are more Velorowdies?I see no connection between Veloring and Velorowdys.
Rather, you have to be careful when planning that there is no undesirable acceleration of car traffic on the Velor route, and that it then represents a security risk.But I definitely don't see any security concerns due to Velorowdies, even if I don't deny that there are them.But there are also in motorized private transport.
Isn't the 25 million project an unjust preference for the bike driver to drivers?I don't see any preference for the bike driver or any road user, as the TCS incorrectly presents (see box).Nowhere is it that car traffic is banished by the street, and it will not.
The opposite is even the case: car and delivery van traffic also benefits from a higher bike content, because then there is more space on the streets.So the TCS doesn't have to worry about car travelers.
What, do you think, has prompted the TCS to make false statements?The fact is that the TCS feeds people with false information.Which is why he does this does not open up to me either.
You have to ask the TCS or directly from the head.I don't want to speculate about what the political motives of the TCS are.Why Pro Velo the TCS "hair -raising false information"
Preserving base.Pro Velo wants to have the Veloring built in Basel.The cost estimates for the project in Basel assume CHF 25 million, paid by the taxpayer.
A referendum committee from TCS, LDP and SVP fights the project.In a letter, the TCS warned its members about the project and listed some arguments or points that want to show why the project must not be realized.Pro Velo reported to this at the BAZ.
According to the political bicycle, it is "hair -raising false information".Following a list of arguments that are not correct according to Pro Velo: & GT;On the whole veloring, Velos get nowhere an exclusive right of training.
The right to go to all vehicles applies. & GT;There is no preference for cyclists compared to motorized private transport. & GT;The bicycle breeds are permissible under federal law because the Astra is currently trying in different cities. & GT;
Neither the current bicycle road trial nor the Veloring change something on the side of Velos.Both the initiative text and the formulation of the government emphasize that all measures with the applicable law must be in accordance with. & GT;Neither the initiative text nor the government's advice and the great
Rates provides speed 30, although this could be useful on a few, short sections. & GT;The Veloring does not affect the spalle ring, the stone ring and the Black Forest Bridge.Veloring does not come along or on these streets. & GT;
The veloring should now not be designed as “bicycle streets”.This should only be the case on suitable routes. & GT;Veloring is not placed on the main traffic axes.

Velostrasse tempted cyclists to more risk / / from Martin Regenass Basel.
Cities like Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zurich are ruled for the introduction of so -called bike streets.This is intended to enjoy bicycle and e-bike drivers in 30 zones and get to the goal faster.The remedy to accelerate the bike ride is simple:
The transverse roads, which are connected to the bicycle road, is taken with stop or no advance signals so that the cyclists do not have to stop.Pilot tests have been running on Mülhauserstrasse and St. Alban-Rheinweg in Basel for half a year.They should show whether bicycle streets could be included in the road traffic law in the future.
Split opinion on bike riders Thomas Floge is well received on the St. Alban-Rheinweg.“It is more pleasant to cycle through the street without having to grant the right of transport from the right.»
An 18-year-old cyclist also supports the lead."I think it's good to make the city more bike -friendly." However, drivers see the matter a little different.A motor driver interviewed at the St. Alban Rheinweg says that the bike drivers and e-bike drivers would now drive through the street faster.
“This creates more dangerous situations between bike drivers and drivers, as well as between footballers and cyclists.The cyclists have the feeling that they have free rail, »says the woman who does not want to read her name in the newspaper.Motorist Sarah Dörig, on the other hand, also welcomes the bike breeds to protect the bicycles.
Before introducing Velostrasse, she had often had the experience that bicycles coming from the left had cut the first step.«I almost picked them up by car.»Since the pilot project has not yet ended, the authorities are covered.

However, this requires an adjustment of the signaling regulation and the traffic regulation regulation at the federal level.The Federal Council would have to decide at the end.In a media release, the canton of Basel-Stadt speaks of a “federal pilot project bike streets of the Astra”.
This explains that the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra) has the lead.The city of Zurich also "tests the so -called Velostrasse" as part of a pilot project by the Federal Office of Streets ".In a media release, the city of St. Gallen even wrote that the Astra had launched the pilot test.
Media spokesman Martin Schütz also speaks of a "ongoing federal pilot project that is carried out in our canton by the Office of Mobility at the Cantonal Police Basel-Stadt, which leaves an inquiry regarding number of accidents in the Basel test road on the St. Alban Rheinweg".Beim construction and traffic department (BVD), which includes the office for mobility, spokesman Daniel Hofer also talks about the “pilot phase of the project of the Federal Office of Strassen Astra will take until September 2017”.Cities are responsible for this information from the media positions, the Astra does not agree.
Media spokesman Thomas Rohrbach calls the statement from the Office for Mobility "simply wrong".«The lead is not with the Astra.»Only the cities are responsible for the implementation of the pilot tests.
You would also pay the pilot tests yourself.Rohrbach: «The attempts are neither on our behalf nor on our reason.Which is why the cities speak of the 'Astra attempt' again and again is really a mystery to me. »The task of the Astra is the approval of the experiments because these took place outside of the applicable traffic rules and signaling regulations.
In addition, the Astra would strive for a certain standardization of the attempts and the associated reporting in order to be able to assess knowledge gained.Rohrbach: "We have therefore set up a few rules and coordinated something - this in the sense of help, but nothing more." The situation in Rohrbach is clear.The initiative comes from the cities.
The Astra had checked the applications, requested improvements and, if possible, granted and has the relevant permits.«In return for the approval, we expect the cities to report scientific reporting after the pilot phase has been completed.»This serves as the basis to assess any proposals for the legal amendment.

"The bison run against the next wall" / / by Martin Regenass basel.There is talk of a “safe comfort route” or an “epoch -making” project when the supporters talk about the bike.
In a circle of around ten kilometers, the route is to lead far around the city center and connect important employers such as Roche, Syngenta or Novartis to the SBB station and the Badischer Bahnhof.However, two essential ring connections are not included in the price of CHF 25 million.On the one hand, a bridge over the Rhine between the St. Alban Valley and the Spachelrain next to the Roche is missing.
On the other hand, a gap would have to be closed in the zoological garden.The veloring is said to lead from the St. Galler and Bernerring directly via Zolli.This is supposed to avoid the bike drivers around the Dorenbach grei desires, which is considered dangerous.
A direct connection between the Bernerring and the strawberry ditch and thus between Basel West and the Gundeli would be built.If you look at the current route guidance of the veloring on the Velorlorichte plan of the Office of Mobility, this customsisteg would lead over the lion enclosure, the flamingo facility and over the square with the bison.Now the lions, over whose heads the bicycles could one day, are not cuddled, but predators.
In 2007, this experience in Zolli had two wild dogs, the system of which is adjacent to the lion enclosure.In March and September, a wild dog found the way across the electric fence and landed in the water ditch of the lion enclosure.The big cats pulled out the dogs and killed them with a targeted bite - a natural spectacle between two food competitors.
The cyclists could also fall off when a bridge over the lion enclosure because of a fall or children who were put on the bridge railing by their parents.Animals want to retro Zingg, senior curator from Zurich Zoo, does not convince a bicycle bridge over the Basler Zolli.ZINGG owes severe concerns about the condition of the animals.
«When people go over the animals in height, they are a moment of risk in their eyes.»While predators such as lions could assess things over time that took place above them.Huftors such as bison, however, could be startled by cyclists who go over them or their shadows.
Zingg: «You may react panicked with flight and races against the next wall."Zingg" clumsily "calls a bridge on the bison enclosure for this species. In the case of show systems, it is therefore generally important that people do not have an insight into the animals from all sides, but ideally from one side.
«The animals can then observe the audience in a targeted manner and withdraw if necessary.»Zingg also expresses concerns because the bridge could be walked on for 24 hours."I do not wish for the animals in Zolli that people on this bridge are then at night, throw them objects over the bridge railings into the enclosures or even descend in the high spirits."
Furthermore, a bridge over the facilities would destroy their design."You would break the entire concept of the system, which is a landscape and a habitat," says Zingg.The curator cannot therefore imagine that a possible bridge over the Zolli will be open.
“Rather, you would have to do a hose in which the cyclists are not visible - maybe with a few windows.»Zingg recommends a bridge along the SNCF.Security people's railway bridge for bear parking experiences with bridges over predator enclosure.There the Nydeggbrücke leads next to the Bärenpark.
In September 2013 there was an incident when someone climbed up the glass pane below the Nydeggbrücke and threw something into the enclosure.What it was could not be determined, because Bär Finn eats it up and then fully got except.Likewise, some time ago a boy thrown a hub into the bear enclosure and was frightened by Bärin Björk and her boys.
Like Finn, they got away with the horror.In November 2009, a mentally impaired man climbed into the bear enclosure after a sack had fallen into the facility with his drawings.The man was slightly injured by a bear.
Jürg Hadorn, project manager of Zoo Bern, speaks of a "fantastic insight" into the bear complex from the Nydeggbrücke.However, he points out that the bridge leads to a "big security problem".There are always "unreasonable people" who put their children on the parapet so that they could crash.
In Bern, security employees and volunteers monitor the situation on site.Hadorn: «You can never rule out something stupid.»In contrast to ZingG, Hadorn does not think that a bridge over the Zolli should be closed.
«At the height of the fall, it probably doesn't matter whether lions are below or a track where freight trains drive - both would probably not survive either.»According to Hadorn, the animals would quickly get used to the new situation.Nevertheless, it would also find Hadorn an unsightly picture, would lead a bridge over the Zolli and cut it in the air.
«An urban element would then shape the image of the zoological garden.“He also hoped for the Zolli that the bike bridge will lead along the SNCF line one day.At Zolli, the media office does not speak a plain text regarding the possible lines of the bridge over the lions, flamingos or bison: «We do not assume a disturbance for the animals due to the location of the bridge.
We don't know the exact course of the bike yet. »Syngenta would be unclear veloring.The opponents of Veloring criticize the 25 million project that there are no surveys for benefit.It is clear that bike drivers each take the shortest and most direct path from A to B.
With this economic behavior you have been able to strengthen your powers.Employees of the large chemical and pharmaceutical companies could benefit, who would be due to the veloring of the vocal cord.At the Agrochemie company Syngenta, on request, around two thirds of the employees use the bike to drive to work.
Some of them every day.“We therefore welcome this initiative, which ensure more security and comfort for cyclists on the street.“Novartis does not want to comment.
But: «We are basically interested in a good development of the campus in Basel.»In addition to public transport and motorized private transport, this would of course also include the bicycles.An improvement in the bike infrastructure welcomes “basically” also Roche. Marvolk will sign the last word for veloring habengen.
The Grand Council spoke CHF 25 million for Veloring in November.Thereupon a non -partisan committee took the referendum.In the past few weeks, LDP, SVP, the automotive club, the Touring Club, the Chamber of Commerce of both Basel and the trade association have been collecting against this “luxury project”.
Exponents of the parties and associations handed them over to the State Chancellery almost two weeks ago.As the authority published in the cantonal sheet yesterday, the referendum against the “ring-shaped bike-comfort route (Veloring)” came about with 3768 signatures.This will lead to a referendum via Veloring.
This takes place at the earliest on May 21, 2017. Compared to Denkmu Newsprobicht trade association director Gabriel Barell at Veloring from a "dangerous and expensive label".

Velo offensive in the country / / region of Fraubrunnen
Velo paths in and around Bern should be more attractive in the future.Demands that have a long tradition in the city are now becoming louder in the country.The bike paths in the Bern region should become more attractive, safer, more direct and more suitable for everyday use.
That is why the regional conference Bern-Mittelland (RKBM) and Emmental have now launched a project for a new velor route between Jegenstorf and Bätterkinden (see box). The expansion of the range between Bern and Solothurn is accommodating the planning of the new bike route.The building slopes and maintenance routes of regional traffic in Bern-Solothurn (RBS) along the railway line would be used for bicycle traffic.The public participation for the project lasts until March 20.
The city and region of the RKBM's planned route shows that bike transport should be attractively designed not only in the city, but also in agglomeration and in rural areas and seems to be gained.The bike offensive, which is carried out by traffic director Ursula Wyss in the city of Bern, also seems to be increasingly stimulating rural communities.In earlier years, similar bike projects within the RKBM had caused criticism.
It is different today: The regional overall traffic and settlement concept, which was submitted to the canton last November, is also increasingly demanding bicycle measures in the country.Laurent Reusser, head of the RKBM department, says: «The radius of the bicycle lines covered is becoming increasingly bigger.»
The city and region want to combine better through new bicycle paths.Above all, the growing importance of e-bikes has meant that the demand and attractiveness of bicycle traffic in agglomeration communities have increased steadily in recent years.But even in rural communities, the discourse on bicycle planning would increase.
«The municipalities are increasingly realizing that funding makes sense.However, projects must be shown which are financially portable, because the implementation is ultimately with the respective communities.»Particular attention is paid to traffic safety for students.
According to Reusser, the priority of the RKBM in the city in the city and the relief of traffic nodules is in the core agglomeration.The largest need here is with the agglomeration communities.But try to support smaller communities in the country in the entire agglomeration - from Wichtrach to Fraubrunnen.
Above all, it was about reducing skepticism against investments.Ultimately, however, support from the federal government would be crucial here.Contribution from the federal
According to RKBM, costs for the Jegenstorf - Bätterkinden bike route are roughly 3.4 million francs.At the moment it is still being clarified to what extent the canton and the federal government will be involved in the costs.In the event of co -financing by the federal infrastructure fund of the federal infrastructure fund for agglomeration projects, this would probably cover between 30 and 35 percent of the costs.
The canton would participate in the remaining costs with around 55 percent, which can reduce the municipal share by up to 75 percent.According to Reusser, you want to search for Synergia with the double -track expansion of the RBS at the Veloroute, and you assume a minimal consumption of cultural land.Only the beginning of the Jegenstorf-Bätterkinden Veloroute is only one of many planned measures to promote bike traffic in the Bern-Mittelland region and to bind to a higher standard.
It is assumed that the planned project will be accepted.Everyday velor routes lead to a noticeable relief of buses, trains and streets, especially during rush hour.As in the city, the importance of bike planning increases in the country.
Nikola Stosic "The communities realize that funding makes sense." Laurent Reusserdie Neue Veloroutedie 10.6 kilometers long Veloroute will run between Jegenstorf and Grafenried east next to the RBS-Trassee.
Between Grafenried and Fraubrunnen, the path is led along the Kantonsstrasse.The route from Fraubrunnen to Bätterkinden runs again on the side of the railway line.From the Bätterkinden train station to the cantonal border of Solothurn, the route of the Kantonsstrasse follows.

The city is making space for Velo / / Bern, Muri, Canton and the Bund in the east.Thanks to improvements, car traffic should be handled more efficiently in the future - and at the same time a lot of space for the bike will be created.
The SVP feared “torpedoing of commercial and private traffic” because middle-left “like crazy” expanded the bike infrastructure.But the resistance was in vain: when Bern's city parliament treated the project loan for the redesign of Gunplatz, Burgernziel and Ostring in August 2015, the bicycle people prevailed.They commissioned the local council to plan a 1.50 meter wide bicycle strip on the entire route in both directions.
The municipal council reported in October 2016: The requested bike strip was “possible continuously”.However, the planners were not yet satisfied with this.
Behind the scenes they are currently breeding over an even more bike -friendly solution."We check whether there are better variants," confirms traffic planner Karl Vogel.Because: «Finally, the route is part of a planned Velohauptraute.»
And with these there is a clear width of 2.50 meters.In the next few weeks, the city wants to decide exactly where the Velohauptraute between Helvetia and Freudenbergerplatz should carry out.It is already clear that it is partially separated on today's sidewalk.
This has been discussed with foot traffic and disabled organizations, says Vogel."On the affected sections, the space is sufficient for a structurally separated bike tour." The roundabout will be a small part of a huge box that applies in the east of the city: So sooner or laterThe tram tracks are renovated, relatively urgent in the Ostring.
After the tram stop has been relocated, the waiting house is to be removed and the kiosk is transferred to the new development in the Burgernziel.Gunplatz is also renovated, where the traffic regime remains untouched.In contrast to the Burgernzielkreisel, which is converted into an intersection with a light signal system.
The trambing in the Burgernziel falls away and is to be replaced by a service track between Muristrasse and Ostring.Numerous third -party projects, such as traffic releases in the quarters, the renovation of the Axis Monbijoubrücke / Eikerstrasse or the redesign of the Helvetiaplatz (see box), are attached to the demanding overall project.
In the original lecture by the municipal council, also listed as a "dependent" third -party projects are the breakdown use blocked (Pun) blocked by complaints on the highway between Wankdorf and Muri and the correction Thunstrasse Muri.Entering the federal government's two projects indicate that the city is not alone with its challenges in the east.The municipality of Muri near Bern is also affected, the correction Thunstrasse Muri lies with the canton, Pun at the Federal Office of Strassen (Astra). Five years ago, when the whole planning was at the beginning, this partner combined a bad suspicion:
Did the city want to outsource its traffic jams, relieve its own streets and provoke a traffic chaos in Muri and on the highway?The Muri parliament protested against the city's plans as well as the Astra, which appealed to an Ostring's first planning approval process.Under the direction of city engineer Hans-Peter Wyss, the city started again-and now has all the partners on the boat, as Wyss says: «All project partners are now speaking a common language and have agreed on how to proceed.»
The authorities played the updated forecasts in their hands: According to the latest figures, the traffic load in 2030 will be lower when it was estimated in the preliminary project of 2011."In addition, the traffic in the future can be organized much more efficiently thanks to perennial detectors and cleverly placed storage rooms." In the rushhour it will be constricted: instead of assuming that car traffic in Perimeter Thunplatz / Ostring has to be reduced by 15 percent, the planners are now believedthat traffic in 2030 can be processed without this reduction.
"Only in the peak times in the morning and evening, some of the traffic cannot be overcome without any additional measures," said Wyss."However, the storage rooms have enough capacities to compensate for this temporary overload." But the new plans also stay with the "dosing routes", where waiting times for drivers are incurred, are mainly due to or outside the city, during traffic betweenthe Bernese Thunstrasse and the Ostring also flows during the peak times.According to Wyss, the public transport is not being hindered at the risk of backlog on the highway.
Everything depends on the Pun "We found a consensus," says Thomas Hanke (FDP), Mayor of Muri.«Now there is a solution that is visible to everyone.»He was glad that the city had thoroughly covered its planning and participation of the partners involved.
Hanke's approval of the path chosen has a restriction: «The whole planning depends on the fact that the Pun between Wankdorf and Muri can be realized."Vogel and Wyss from the Bernese city administration confirm this:" The updated traffic forecasts assume that the Pun can be realized in the long term - in the time horizon 2030 - "says Wyss.Christoph Hämmannder Burgernzielkreisel is transformed with traffic lights for the intersection.
This is one of many upcoming changes in the east of the city of Bern.Pictures Andreas Blatter «The traffic can be organized much more efficiently in the future thanks to perennial detectors and cleverly placed storage rooms.» City engineer Hans-Peter Wysshelvaplatiaplatztramwaupläffe is not built.
The untidy location and serving as a parking lot is to be upgraded.This fits that the city, together with the burger community and the canton, informed that the potential of a "museum island" should be clarified around the historical museum (we reported).Regional overall traffic and settlement concept (RGSK) should be built in the same place.The project is off the table, says Ursula Wyss (SP), urban traffic director and Bernmobil Board of Directors, on request.
The RGSK actually provides for a tram cupboard on the Helvetiaplatz.But: «The idea diametrically contradicts all other concerns on the pitch.»The municipal council therefore decided to rely on more quality of stay and not to continue the project for a tram cupboard.
Hae "The traffic jam is supposed to disappear from the villages" Bernese Agglo groans under increasing traffic.Dosing and control systems will soon help.
After initial skepticism, trust in the measures grows.Stau, bad air and noise: motorized traffic often causes trouble.
Hardly anyone wants to have the tin avalanches on their own front door.Nevertheless, everyone wants to get their destination as quickly as possible.With various measures, the municipalities are trying to reduce traffic or to steer it in the right way.
Often the measures on the axes of one and the axes of the city of Bern are aimed.A new traffic management is currently planned in the east of Bern (see main text).The projects do not always come across mutual love in the surrounding communities.
Thanks to the increased regional cooperation, however, the criticism is becoming increasingly quiet.Bone of the chicken truck is not everywhere: the Schermenweg between Bern and Ostermundigen is still a bone of contention.
In 1995 the Stadtberner section of the road was closed in the direction of a motorway.To the dismay of Ostermundigen.
Since then, the municipality has repeatedly attempted to open the street on both sides.The local FDP made the last attempt with the help of a motion.The municipal parliament rejected the advance.
However, the municipality wants to stay tuned: the opportunity to do so sees her in the expansion of the Wankdorf node.Because in the course of this, the Bolligenstrasse and Schermenweg intersection should also be expanded.
Improvement is also urgently needed: "The paths to the city of Bern are increasingly resembling an obstacle course," says Ernst Hirsiger.The Ostermundiger, who politicizes for the SVP in the local parliament, use public transport to go to the city whenever.
«If I take the car, I also have my reasons.»But more and more detours and the elimination of parking spaces are increasingly difficult.Often the steering and calming measures are also one-sided and disadvantaged those who rely on the axles of outlay.»
His opinion of dosing systems is more differentiated, which use traffic lights to steer traffic.He does not want to deny that they can defuse the situation to a certain amount of traffic."You just have to consider that the traffic will continue to increase." Pilot project in the north
Bernsdosier systems are not limited to the city of Bern.A large pilot project is planned in Agglo: traffic management Bern-Nord.
In addition to the city of Bern, the municipalities of Zollikofen, Bolligen, Ittigen, Urtenen-Schönbühl and Münchenbuchsee are involved-in addition to the city of Bern.The core of the project are light signals that are supposed to prevent traffic and stow. "The project is necessary to make the traffic more fluid and safer for pedestrians and cyclists," says Thomas Iten, who presides the Bern-Mittelland Regional Conference.The aim is to bring vehicles to the highways as quickly as possible.
"The traffic jam should disappear from the villages." The cooperation between the actors involved is of central importance: canton, municipalities, city and regional conference.«In the case of projects that affect traffic, we all have to tense together.»
The measures should be coordinated and the consent of all affected communities."Alone do not lead to solutions, but to relocation of traffic problems." Kurt Zbinden, former building manager of Ittigen, can confirm this.When the community presented the plans for traffic lights for traffic dose for the first time, residents and neighboring communities were anything but pleased.
"Because the canton has taken over the lead, the doubts could be dispelled." The municipality has now presented positive echo for traffic lights.The measures also include a traffic light system for traffic dosing."The majority of the project was received this time," explains Zbinden.

The Velostadt Zurich and its pitfalls / / In research for the Zurich bicycle malaise (NZZ 15. 3. 17), Urs Bühler makes it a bit too easy and closes with the old lyre that the bicycle rowddy with its "frenzy from the high saddledown »the problems with the“ slow traffic ”stand for gods.The reason why Zurich is still not a bicycle city despite the other wishful thinking can be described as follows:
Despite the epic duration of rule and many bike fantasies, the red -green city mothers and fathers can still not prevail against the deep state in traffic planning.The bicycle path network remains incomplete and is only exposed to it there, but absurdly perfectionistically, where it has space for the cars.These noble passages then serve as trophies for politician photos and track records, but as a cyclist, after driving through them, you end up sticking somewhere between two lanes or right on the edge, between the SUV and the sewage.
The so -called Rowdy is often more of a survival artist who tries to make ends meet undorated, and from time to time Faute de Mieux also ends up on the sidewalk.A behavior that is actively promoted by the city by writing on the foot and bicycle paths mixed by the city, as on Pfingstweidstrasse.Especially with a view to e-bike fashion, this is not only poorly planned, but in common.
I don't want to defend the run over red lights and so on, but it is with a result that you are not really taken seriously in Zurich as a cyclist.Access lessons, which would be possible, not only offer proven bicycle paradise such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, but also practically every other European city that is taken off.Lambs are the same, the bicycleists stick to the rules in their neatly separated traces.
Adrian Krebs, Zurichda's bike in the pedestrian area should by no means be approved (I am annoyed again and again here in Basel), but how dangerous is that really?How many of the 216 traffic fats and 3785 seriously injured on Swiss streets in 2016 are due to this behavior?The fact that the bicycles feel morally superior is also listed again and again.
Since the commentator calls for sober causes, it can be stated in fact that cycling is better in many ways than motorized transportation, keywords are, for example, health, environment and costs.Simon Bishop Izsak, Baselja, it is unfortunately true: «Whoever goes on two legs, the run for his life.»
The bicycles take care of nothing and nobody, traffic lights, pedestrian strips (and people on it) - they don't care.I try to take my briefly, so only so much: I can talk about luck and sometimes I am surprised that I haven't had an accident yet.
Bike drivers on the sidewalk, but of course very narrowly past me;On the pedestrian strip - striped and almost pulled my handbag;I on the pedestrian strip, an automobileist, bike driver races past it and so that he almost roams me;
I want to get out of the bus - bicycles come zas and still has the toupet to ring.Fortunately, I always look on the left and right and again on the left and right.“Velo-Rowdys” is the only right term.
I pay extremely high taxes in the city of Zurich and also the canton and therefore wish that finally and urgently something is being done and not only always talked about it.I cannot judge whether more bicycle paths are needed, but it is certainly more than necessary not only to speak / write not only about the bike drivers, but also put themselves in the position of pedestrians and also do something for them.My letter in this regard to one of the men's city councils was of no use.
One has the impression that this topic is indifferent to women and men in the city council.I also wish that the cyclists (just like the automotiveists) are flashed and lost.Herta Friedmann, Zurich

Veloring-Zollibrücke is to lead along the railway line / / by Martin Regenass Basel.Veloring is like a fasting.
The President of Pro Velo, David Wüest-Rudin, conveyed this picture yesterday the media at the SBB railway embankment near Zolli.As with a fasting, a ring, which is opened with crossings, is said to run a so -called network on the outside.The supporters of the 25 million franc project opened the voting struggle yesterday in splendid sunshine, presented the campaign poster and presented their arguments, which is why a special “comfort route” for cyclists needed on around ten kilometers around the city center.
In the CHF 25 million, 8.5 million should also be included for a bridge over the Zolli.According to the Wüest-Rudin, this should not lead to the lion cage, the flamingogue and the bison system, but along the SBB railway line, where trains run from and to France.
The Zolli confirms this fact on request.Wüest-Rudin spoke of the fact that such bikes in European cities are now common and that it is a matter of course.Such a bike in Basel is now also needed because car traffic could be unmistaked by the bike drivers.
Wüest-Rudin: «The basic idea is to separate the car from bicycle traffic and prevent conflicts between these two types of traffic.»According to the Wüest-Rudin, this should mainly happen on side streets at 30 Tempo 30.«We want to be clearly marked, where the legal advance is lifted.»
This is intended to not have to brake bicycles with the streams and get to the targeted goal faster.On the other hand, public transport is said to be entitled to the bike drivers.In order for cyclists to be able to chat with each other - analogously to the drivers - the width of the bike strips should be designed so that two bicycles can drive side by side.
Wüest-Rudin emphasized that Veloring would promote “cooperation” on the streets, was a “moderate project” and nothing “extremist”, which other road users displace.SP Grand Council and traffic politician Jörg Vitelli also said that the bike would probably cost “no parking spaces”.«Take, for example, Strasburgerallee or the Peter Rot-Strasse.
They are wide enough and offer space for everyone.»Likewise, no parking spaces were lifted for the Pilot Project Bicycle Road on Mülhauserstrasse.Velo drive well for Health CVP / EPP Gross Councilor
Helen Schaverigerlig stroked the public health aspects of bike driving.The JA committee wants to enable bicycles that are also inexperienced by veloring so that they could start their destinations.
Schai-Zigerlig: «Children in particular make unmotivated Schlenker on bicycles that can be dangerous.We want parents to dare to let their children bike alone. »Green Grand Councilor Harald Friedl did not take a fasting to explain the bike, but a pearl necklace.The individual pearls tied into a ring stood for the large employers such as Novartis at the Dreirosenbrücke, Syngenta at the Badischer Bahnhof, Roche on Grenzacherstrasse or leisure facilities such as the Schützenmatt- or Kannenfeldpark.
Friedl: "People should reach the places where they stay with the bike safely, quickly and easily." Finally, SP Grossrat Kaspar Sutter spoke to the economy that the bike will bring with it.«Buildings for bicycles, according to a study by the Federal Office of Street
A higher cost efficiency than investments in other transport infrastructure buildings such as motorways.The CHF 25 million are very well invested, »said Sutter.

Per bike becomes active after accidents / / by Martin Regenass Basel.There are two identical single -track routes for cyclists on intersections in Basel:
One is located on Bäumlihofstrasse near Badischer Bahnhof and flows into the Schwarzwaldstrasse.The other is located on Elsässerstrasse at the meat processor Bell and leads the traffic towards Kohlestrasse.There are separate traces for bicycles and cars on both single -track routes, and on both single -track routes the situation presents itself so that the bike drivers are moved forward by around one and a half meters at the traffic lights.
On March 9, a truck covered a bike driver with a 20 -month -old toddler on March 9, which was bound to the back.Both injured themselves in the fall.According to
The cantonal police collided the cyclist with the truck front while turning.The chauffeur overlooked the cyclist because he was in the dead corner.Fortunately, the fallen survived.
A 62-year-old cyclist was granted a happy outcome after a similar accident last Tuesday.According to the cantonal police, he wanted to go straight to Wettsteinallee at the Bäumlihofstrasse.A 54-year-old truck driver, who turned right, overlooked the cyclist.
This lost life in the tragic accident.The reasons for the accident are still to be clarified, according to the Basel-Stadt cantonal police.Despite the mirror of dead corner of the angle, it can be life-threatening in addition to driving alongside load and delivery vans.
As a bike driver or e-biker, you are in any case the weaker road user.It is also unclear in the two accidents whether the chauffeurs have a blink and thus indicated the change of direction.Or whether they drove off without giving a sign.
It is possible that the bike drivers waved themselves in false security.Human failure cannot therefore be ruled out.The truck driver in Bäumlihofstrasse may not have seen the cyclist analogously to the case on Elsässerstrasse.
Despite the latest facilities and various mirrors, according to Peter Hari, Head of dangerous goods and security at the ASTAG commercial association, there are always unrestricted areas around a truck.«The cyclists should be sensitized that they don't drive in there.We show students using trucks, the cabins of which you can climb how the view from a truck is.»
In addition, the problem of the dead angle is also a permanent topic in further training courses in chauffeurs.Depending on the height of the driver's cab of a truck, the driver does not see down at the front and in front right."There is also a dead corner in the front area." On both intersections, cyclists are placed forward by around one and a half meters when they are single -off compared to motorized traffic.
According to a look, the light signals switch from red over orange to green.That means: Both trucks and bicycles are allowed to drive off at the same time.
For Pro Velo of both Basel, the two accidents are now one of the reasons to become active.President David Wüest-Rudin: «The accidents have not decreased for long-term drivers as with footmakers for a long time.We would therefore like to take a general look at the situation, but in particular the situation on the single -track routes.»
At most, you have to think about something together with the police to make a change on the single -track routes.According to Wüest-Rudin, it is possible that the holding beams are pushed forward for bike drivers compared to those of the cars.«Today it is two meters according to the valid standard.
That is too little because truck drivers can overlook bikers.In our view, it should be four meters.»Pro Velo is very interested in optimizing situations at intersections for the cyclists together with the traffic police.

This is how Veloring / / by Martin Regenassmünster (D) works.The North Rhine-Westphalian Velostadt Münster already has what the Basel voting population will vote on May 21: a veloring.
This is around 4.7 kilometers long and runs in a circle around the center of the old town.It is used daily by thousands of bicycles.These drive from the quarters towards the city center, then bend onto the so-called cycling Schnellstrasse and get by this avenue near their desired target area-and back again.
The BAZ looked at the ring in Münster and tested on the bike, which is only considered in Basel.In addition to Osnabrück and Freiburg im Breisgau, Münster occupies a top spot in Germany.However, the many cyclists also result in negative records.
Münster with 5193 bicycle thefts (with 300,000 residents) in the theft statistics takes up a top position.40 percent of the path with the wheelbar is not harmless in Münster.766 registered accidents with bike participation occurred last year.Nevertheless: Münster has been a bicycle city for decades.
Currently, the Münsterans cover around 40 percent of their ways by bike.There are 29 percent of cars, 22 percent are on foot and only ten percent of the paths are completed by public transport.This is rather moderate compared to other cities and a reason why business people and students are also on the road with the bike.

And what does the bourgeois may recommend: He "can only strongly advise to realize such a ring". The car lobby and the bourgeois politicians in Münster have understood that a gentle unbundling of traffic also brings advantages for the cars.
Only with us do TCS / ACs switch to fundamental opposition.Veloring enjoys broad support: the government council wants him, the big one
Council wants him and the federal government too - he also pays part of it.Now we should clearly confirm this important city infrastructure at the urn.David Wüest-Rudin, Grand Councilor GLP, President Pro Velo of both Basel

Everyone / / / / from Thomas Grossenbacher and Raphael FuhrerMobility research analyzes have one thing in common from veloring: they draw the path of rising bicycle mobility.
It is assumed that the traffic will mainly shift to the bike.Experts estimate that up to 30 percent of car journeys were relocated to bike in agglomerations.The better development of this potential to relieve the environment and the people in the city is therefore an important task of a future mobility strategy.
Basel is in second place with a bike content of 16 percent in Switzerland.However, the Europe -wide comparison clearly shows that this value is far from a lace result and that we have great catch -up potential in Basel.It may be surprising, but it's not just the well -known cities in Denmark and the Netherlands, which can score with a high bike content.
In Italy, for example, the city of Ferrara reaches a bike content of 27 percent.Despite the long and hard winter months, the city of Oulu in northern Finland has a bike content of 21 percent.Basel still has a clear expansion potential for bicycle travelers - only the prerequisites have to be right.
Veloring becomes the backbone of the Velonetz, which is thus with existing and new bike compounds from the surrounding area - Baselland wants to invest 20 million in its bike routes - and is safely and optimally networked in the core city.The veloring not only serves the collection and connection of the bike travelers from the surrounding area, it also connects them without gaps with deliberately chosen places such as the SBB station and the three-rose bridge (Novartis) or to the sports fields.Schools, the Badische Bahnhof and the Roche are also connected and securely connected with it.
Veloring offers security, quick progress and will thus significantly increase the attractiveness of driving bike.Veloring thus becomes the basis of a future -oriented and intermodal mobility.Tram / bus, car or bike are used varying and sensibly as required and distance.
Many comparable European cities prove that the concept works as a secure and quick networking ring and brings advantages for all road users.Due to its size, Munich even has two bike with an inner and external “cycling ring”.Cities like Groningen or the city of Münster presented in the BAZ and many more show impressively that the concept works and increases the bike content massively.
An increase that is particularly beneficial for car travelers who, like traders, cannot do without a car due to their work.Driving is mobility without a damaging climate exhaust, bike saves space because a bike claims at least ten times less space than a car.In addition, you can park eight bicycles on each individual car park.
Driving Velo is noisy.Driving holds fit and reduces health costs throughout Switzerland, i.e. health insurance premiums, by several hundred million francs each year.Velom measures are also inexpensive.
A comparison of the total costs of the bike of CHF 25 million with the costs of the new roundabout “Gundeldingerstrasse Ost / Münchensteinerstrasse Mitte” of 23 million speaks a clear language.It is not surprising that today's opponents of Veloring were criticized to the roundabout advice without criticism in the Grand Council.A yes to Veloring is a yes to a future -oriented mobility policy.

Veloring benefits all / / the planned veloring is an important further traffic development for Basel.Not only for the bike travelers, but for all road users.
It enables unbundling between bicycles and faster motorized traffic on a voluntary basis.Cars can of course also use the veloring entitled to the neighborhood.However, since the veloring leads to a large extent on side streets and through existing Tempo 30 zones, the attractiveness for longer car racks is probably rather low.
Contrary to the opinion of Heiner Vischer and the obviously auto-dominated referendum committee, bicycles do not primarily want to drive primarily in and through the city center, but above all fluidly and safely from and according to B as station, educational institutions and employment locations, etc.And the bike is just right for that.As a pedestrian, cyclist, public transport user and occasional driver, I support Veloring and look forward to more quality of life in Basel for everyone.

Lüthi stops after twenty years on / / region Thun René Lüthi, the first President of Pro Velo Region Thun, resigns after twenty years.
During this time, he was particularly committed to more security for two -wheelers in road traffic.Pro Velo is also committed to sufficient bicycle parking spaces, organizes the bike tour and more.Adrian Christian becomes the new president.
René Lüthi is a passionate cyclist himself.He always comes with the bike, is a convinced helmet carrier and permanently drives with light.Lüthi contributes to his own security as a cyclist.
Security for bicycles in road traffic is an important concern of Pro Velo region Thun."If nobody dared to go to the street with the bike, an important alternative to motorized traffic is eliminated," says Lüthi.But also applies to him:
Driving bicycles has to be fun.He himself uses the bike every day: for the way to work, in leisure time, for the holiday trips, for the exit with the grandchild, in the field or on the bike racing track in Grenchen.The well -known trampling worm and new rickshaws offer fun for everyone.
Large engagement geré Lüthi has been committed to the concerns of bicycle traffic since the 1980s.He was already there when the club was called IG Velo.At that time, he was sent to the authorities when it was important to make contact with them and maintain contacts with them due to road construction projects or bicycle places.
When the association Pro Velo Region Thun was founded as a successor organization by IG Velo, he was elected as president, and in this function he took a seat to the municipal traffic commission."The goals of back then are the same as the club is pursuing them today," says Lüthi."Demands are safe bike compounds, enough (covered) bike parking spaces, tempo ducts in urban areas, minimizing motorized private transport in the city center in favor of pedestrians and cyclists." This is a reason why per bike repeatedly contributes to street construction projects.
«You have to look together, not work against each other, this is the only way to create advantages for the bike, such as that bike can use the bus traces.It gets more and more dangerous for the bike on the main lines, it has much more large cars, it is getting closer for everyone. »For Lüthi, it is important that cycling is always included as a variant in the considerations.«You have to see the bike as an alternative to the juggernut traffic.
Thun still has potential here, »says René Lüthi.«The modal split in favor of bicycle would have to be increased significantly if something is to be done against the increasing traffic jams.Everyone who drives bike does not sit in the car at the same time, and therefore cycling also serves motorized private transport. »Burgdorf is a good example:
There are significantly more bicycles in everyday life.However, in order to do more for cycling, this requires the corresponding political will, Lüthi continued.Not everything realized in recent years has not been able to implement all planned projects per bike.
«But thanks to the tireless efforts of the board, we were quite successful."So when driving on the bus traces, when opening the Aarequais, with the bicycle courses, the bicycle exchange or the light actions, Lüthi lists." We also helped build up the breedation and were involved in the bicycle.The work does not run out per bike in the future either.
Crossings are repeatedly renovated and there we are committed to ensuring that slow traffic is sufficiently taken into account. »Lüthi only regrets that a good ten years ago it was not possible to install a slow-up in the region.Margrit Kunzrené Lüthi also helped as President of Pro Velo Region Thun to build the bike station.
Margrit Kunzchristen is the new President of the General Assembly of Pro Velo Region Thun from Monday evening was marked by the elections of the board and the distribution of the offices.
The five previous board members Adrian Christen, Brigitte Stüdle, Cäcilia Smith, Urs Witschi and Hans Imhoof were confirmed for a further term of two years.Olaf Müller was elected to the board as a new member.The previous ones retain their departments.
Adrian Christen takes over the Presidium of René Lüthi and Olaf Müller the marketing and website department.The long -time secretary Lilli Huber made her office at the end of 2016 and was adopted on Monday with an impressive laudation.It was the conscience and brain of the association, because she had great knowledge of legal questions about the association and regulations, and she also knew how to formulate.
Lilli Huber and René Lüthi had “Gchrampfet” for the association, so Hans Imhoof expressed himself.Lilli Rufer, the successor to Lilli Huber, was already elected at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.She started her office in early 2017.
The annual report in its new presentation, the 2016 invoice and the balanced budget 2017 were unanimously accepted.Mkuadrian Christians "Anyone who drives bike does not sit in the car at the same time, and thus also serves bicycle also serves motorized private transport."

Reasonable bicycle measures / / for Basel's coordination on Veloring;BAZ diverse diverse from May 10, Helen and Peter Schai write about a relief effect, which the bike is supposed to have on the motorized and public transport.
Because more people would switch to bike.This is wishful thinking.It is generally known and, by the traffic counts of the construction and traffic department, proves that the weather in the very first line affects the demand for bike rides.
It is also documented by traffic counts that most bike rides in Basel lead radially in and out of the city center.Instead of putting a lot of time and money into a superfluous bike, additional parking facilities for bicycles at the train stations and in the center should be created.It is also important to promote the expansion of attractive bike compounds of routes, on which bike is actually driven.
Veloring is completely placed past the needs of cyclists.Let us correctly set the priorities in bike promotion and we vote no to the unnecessary luxury bike on May 21.Serano Pasquinelli, Basel

Everyone / / the Veloring is a Win-win concept: the cyclists benefit because they are faster and safer forward, as well as the car travelers, as the traffic is escaped and each additional bike means one car less.
All Baselers even benefit because they are exposed to less noise and pollutant emissions.And last but not least the state treasury because the bike, compared to any other traffic project, is an absolute bargain.For comparison: The new traffic circle on Leimgrubenweg will cost 2 million more than the entire bike.

25 million for a Veloring / / Angelika Hardeg Gerder Average Swiss in 2015 drove the same number as 20 years ago.This is shown by the latest traffic figures of the Federal Statistics Office published on Tuesday.
Already today only the Winterthurers use bikes more often than the Basler.Nevertheless, the city on the Rhine now wants to invest again in the bike promotion: On Sunday, the city bases vote whether a bike around the city center is to be created for CHF 25 million.
The specially marked bicycle would connect nodes such as the train stations that combine pharmaceutical companies, residential areas and schools.It is not yet clear which streets the approximately 10 -kilometer long bicycles would be.In order to make a complete connection, a new bridge over the railway track and the zoo would have to be built.
It is planned that the bicycle tray would mainly lead over existing Tempo 30 streets.Cars are likely to continue to operate on these routes, but bicycles have basically progressed - and they are likely to drive side by side.The cantonal parliament approved the Veloring template in November.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SVP then took the referendum together with business and transport associations.They argue that the bike is unnecessary and too expensive.The cyclists wanted to get directly from one place to the other and not take a detour via Veloring, says LDP Grand Councilor Heiner Vischer, who advertises a no at the forefront.
The supporters of the SP, the Greens and Green Liberals as well as parts of the CVP and the FDP rely on security: By unbuming bicycle and car routes, cycling would be more secure, especially for older people and families.The drivers also benefited from veloring because their streets were relieved, the supporters' side.

In the city the best means of transport / / cyclist need bike;BAZ 15.
5. 17Lieber Mr. Pasquinelli.The bike as the best city means of transport can and should be promoted at different levels.Veloring also supports the radial routes you demand.
Therefore, everyone who wants to promote cycling is right on Sunday.Veloring becomes a visible and secure scaffolding for a network (!) Of existing and planned bicycle routes.It brings a quick implementation of the bike route network, with safer and direct connections to workplace areas, train stations, schools and leisure facilities, and with the customsisteg a new bicycle and pedestrian connection between SBB and Grossbasel West.
Velor routes from Riehen and other suburbs are optimally connected to the ring, all city quarters benefit from better connections.Bern and Zurich have recognized the immense advantages of the bike and invest three to five times.The following also applies to Veloring: Every franc in the franc improves the foot and bike traffic and thus the quality of life and a city.

Master plan according to Veloring breakdown / / by Martin Regenass Basel.A short week after the folkly no veloring, the Basel government presents its intentions regarding its further bike policy.
The committee approved the so -called master plan Velo yesterday.This “traffic policy compass” should ensure that Basel-Stadt is the most bicycle-friendly city across Switzerland.In the ranking of Pro Velo regarding bike friendliness from 2014, Basel took second place behind Winterthur.
However, if you add smaller cities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants, Basel only takes 14th place out of 28 cities assessed.According to Martin Dolleschel, project manager of the mobility strategy at the construction and traffic department, it is the "vision of the government to become Velostadt number one".The bike promotion is one of the traffic policy goals in the canton of Basel-Stadt.
The implementation of this vision is to be achieved by different means.One of them is structural changes in road renovations.Dolleschel: «We always clarify whether there is space for bike strips, whether crossings can be designed bicycle -friendly or traffic lights can be switched from a bicycle.»
In addition, there would be clarifications for the construction of Velopark spaces.The concrete key projects are the construction of a bike station at the Badischer Bahnhof as well as more bicycle spaces at the SBB train station and a pedestrian and velo bridge over the Zolli.With the Velomaster plan there is no monetary claim to the Grand Council.
The conversions in favor of the bicycles would come from the budget of the construction and traffic department or would be applied for separately for larger projects for larger projects.Pendants and e-bikes as an incentive to become more means of becoming the most bicycle-friendly city consists in services that the canton wants to offer through third parties.For example, partners, for example, should provide bike trailers, e-bikes or load bikes for testing in order to make cycling more popular.
In its communication, the government mentions communication as the third point in order to get closer to the top podium.For example, she wants to assist the Basers with campaigns such as “Fair in traffic” or information and consultations in the context of mobility management.According to the last 2010 surveys regarding
Mobility has covered the Basel 16 percent of their ways with the bike.In comparison, this value in the Westphalian city of Münster is 40 percent.This is one of the highest values across Europe.
According to Dolleschel, the government has not formulated a goal of how big this value should be in ten to fifteen years - the Masterplan Velo takes that long.Dolleschel: «However, there are still many people who put short distances by car.We want to get them to the bike.
Almost 50 percent of car journeys are shorter than five kilometers.»There is still a lot of potential in the city in terms of cycling.With the Velo master plan, it is also about arousing the desire to drive.
According to Dolleschel, the Veloring would have found its way in the event of an assumption in the Velo master plan.However, this is not a direct reaction to the bike rejection, but goes back to a political advance of SP Grand Councilor Jörg Vitelli.There is no government -of -the -art master plan Auto.

In the land of the Velomuffel / / Bern.Around one million bicycles are unused in Swiss garages, screeds, cellars and barns - not counted for children, the spokesman for the Swiss specialist office for two -wheeler issues (SFZ), Roland Fuchs estimates.
Another around 3.3 million bicycles whiz, gondola, crawl or curves over Swiss streets.200 years after the German noble Karl Friedrich von Drais had mastered a 14 -kilometer route in Mannheim on June 12, 1817 with his impeller without pedals, the Velo also conquered all layers in this country.Switzerland is a “developing country”, as the President of Pro Velo Switzerland, Matthias Aebischer, says.
Only eight percent of the population regularly bike.This is shown by surveys on mobility.The Dutchman are record holders: 36 percent of them constantly sit on their “fiets”.
The comparison between mountainous Switzerland and the flat Netherlands is somewhat unfair, said Aebischer.But the National Council from Bern wants to bring the Swiss to the level of Germany.Twelve percent of Germans regularly use their bike.
No more cultural people put on the bike, rely on a double strategy for each bike: targeted actions and a better bike infrastructure, that is, more bicycle paths.For this reason, Pro Velo submitted her bike initiative in 2016.This requires that the constitutional text for foot and hiking trails are supplemented by the bike paths.
"While the hiking trail network is almost something like a national cultural asset, a continuous velonetz is missing," said Aebischer.The Federal Council wants to compare the initiative a counter -proposal.In order for people to sadge, they have to feel safe.
"It is said that the more people in a city are traveling with the bike, the better it develops," said Aebischer.For example, there are hardly any cyclists in Zurich.The “City comparison mobility” between six cities showed that only six percent of the population trusted the bike in Zurich.
Basel (16 percent), Winterthur (13 percent) and Bern (eleven percent) were better.In the early history of the bike, the Velo development country Switzerland was a country of bike developers.Swiss companies and private individuals were involved in the technical development of the running machine on the bike from the start, according to a "History of Slow Traffic in Switzerland of the 19th and 20th centuries" published by the Astra.
For example, Condor produced Velos in the Bernese Jura from around 1890, which could "keep up" with the foreign products.In addition, there were smaller production facilities such as Van Leisen in Geneva, Flamme in Basel or the Rüegg machine factory in Uster.Sda

Where bike drivers stand in line / / Copenhagen is the ideal bike city.So ideal that there is a long traffic jam on the bike paths.
Electronic traffic control boards should now solve the problem.Silke Bigalkestockholmirendendich even the good will be too much, just in Copenhagen: the city has achieved that people drive more with bike than on any other means of transport.
Veloh capital, that was the declared goal.The city planners have created bicycle paths, built Velobrücken and only created wide traces for cyclists.Even the waste bins tend to meet the cyclist so that he can meet them by driving past.
Only, now many people cycle through Copenhagen that they are in the way of each other.During the main traffic time, they often push tires on tires through the city center, a two- to three-lane electricity, as on the highway.If someone drives too slowly and someone else is staggering, it builds up.
At some intersections, the cyclists are in line just to get over the traffic lights.It takes several traffic light phases to get over the street.Of course, bicycles are poison for the Copenhagen concept.
Because according to the survey, people get on the bike, especially for one reason: they arrive faster.The city now wants to set up electronic traffic control boards to avoid traffic jams.
Red and green arrows indicate whether the path is clear or whether the cyclist should switch to side streets.Only a small step of this table is already on the favorite road of cyclists, on the Nørrebrogade, which is sometimes completely blocked for cars.There the city counted up to 48,800 bicycles a day.
Four more tables will soon follow on other busy bike paths.The question will be whether the Copenhagen cyclists really accept detours.For Erik Hjulmand, the signs are only a “first very, very small step” to a real solution.
He headed the Copenhagen department of the Danish bicycle association.For him it is clear: more and even wider bike paths would help.
In addition, says Hjulmand, the traffic light phases should be adapted more often to the needs of cyclists.Every second year Copenhagen publishes a “Velobericht”.The latest states that two thirds of the Copenhagener ride a bike to work, school or university every day.
Now the traffic jams endanger this track record. "If people see that they no longer get through bike, you can no longer get them to use the bike," says Niels Agerholm, an expert in transport system management from the University of Aalborg.He does not believe that the new boards will change a lot on the routes.But the boards are a sign that the city takes the problems seriously, and they make traffic jams more bearable:
"Waiting for the bus is also easier when you know how long you have to wait," says Agerholm.One should not forget one thing, says the traffic expert.The Copenhagen bike policy is a success story.
The success in the Danish capital is particularly noticeable in pedestrians and drivers, which are very often annoyed by the Copenhagen bicycle flood.But the cyclists are also annoyed."We hear more and more from people who would like to drive with the bike that they don't dare," says Erik Hjulmand.
Sometimes, he confesses, the cars are not the biggest problem for bike drivers, but other cyclists.Velostau at a traffic light in Copenhagen.Photo: Frédéric Soltan (Getty Images)

Purpose for 1500 bicycles wanted / / DFR.·
In large European cities such as Paris or Barcelona, there have been automatic bicycle stations for years that are used by tourists and locals.Such a system has also been planned in Zurich for a long time.Today's city councilors Daniel Leupi (Gp.) And André Odermatt (sp.) Ten years ago brought up the idea when they were still simple city parliamentarians.
In 2015, the government finally announced that it commissioned the Postbus subsidiary PubliBike to put at least 100 bike stations into operation with around 1,500 bicycles.The first bikes should be borrowed in 2016.But this did not happen ;
There were delays because of a legal dispute.Unlocked applicants continued the decision of the city council until before the Federal Supreme Court.
The business is still pending there.The “Züri Velo” project could not yet roll. ”However, the target group publicblibike has not remained idle in the meantime.The company, which already operates larger bike sharing stations in Nyon and Lausanne, has taken ahead in system development.
Above all, the question of where the 1,500 bicycles can be stationed in the future.According to Managing Director Bruno Rohner, the PubliBike rental system works best when as many locations as possible can be offered to the whole urban area as possible."The more denser, the better," says Rohner.
It is particularly attractive are locations near large train stations and other traffic hubs.Because public space in Zurich is scarce and valuable, the company is examining various opportunities to make room for your bikes.«We are talking to companies.
We want to realize cooperation, »explains the CEO.The aim is that, for example, large employers provide part of their private property to build bike parking spaces there.These would then be either intended exclusively for the employees of the respective company or for the general public.
"We are sure that there is a need for this," says Rohner.Especially large companies with many employees commute to the city of Zurich are the focus of public.In addition to tourists, such so-called commuters are a target group of the bicycle hier.
Several companies have already been interested in entering into a partnership, says Rohner.Talks are also going on with public institutions such as hospitals or universities.Many other provider publicblibics or “Züri Velo”, as it will be in the city of Zurich, has the declared goal of individually opening the “last mile” of combined mobility.
This means that it wants to cover routes in inner -city traffic that is not operated by any bus or tram."This is how we close a gap and increase the attractiveness of the public transport offer as a whole," explains Managing Director Rohner.
This also defuses the general traffic load in the city centers.Similar models in other cities showed that this works.Publibike is not the only provider for the “last mile” in Zurich.
The Carvelo2go project started operating last week.Since then, 22 cargo bits have been rented throughout the city for larger purchases or trips with children.There have also been 200 e-bikes from “Smide” since last year.
The pilot project is borne by Mobiliar insurance.The repairs and the charging of the batteries do “Züri rolls”.This is another bicycle loan.

More bike and motorcyclists / / by Martin Regenass Basel.
«It is necessary to further expand the bike frastructure and continue to invest in more security and comfort for the bicycle travelers in the future.»The building and traffic department of government councilor Hans-Peter Wessels (SP) comes to this conclusion after it has analyzed traffic data.The reason: in the canton of Basel-Stadt, more and more bicycles are being driven.
Specifically, the cyclists in the city in 2016 had covered five percent more ways compared to the previous year.Compared to 2010, this is an increase of 23 percent, it says in a message.A counting point on the basis of which the data has collected is located on the Wettstein bridge.
A transition between the large and the small basel important for commuters.According to the Office for Mobility, an average of 6674 two -wheelers were counted here in 2016.However, according to statistics, this number not only contains bicycles, but also motorcycles.
This leads to a blurring.In 2015, an average of 6652 bicycles and motorcycles drove over the Wettstein bridge every day.The crossings of Velos, Töffs, Töfflis or scooters have therefore increased by only 0.3 percent.
The oldest count at the Office for Mobility dates from 2013. At that time, an average of 5710 two -wheelers drove over the Wettstein bridge.The number of two -wheelers on the building has increased by 16 percent by 2016.
Data from 2010 is not available on the homepage of the Office of Mobility.Velodata weather -adjusted further blurring results from the inclusion of the weather into the traffic statistics of the bike.The Office for Mobility, for example, includes rainy weather, snowfall or sunshine in the counting data for bicycles and motos.
This is intended to compensate for fluctuations - cyclists take the public transport in wet.Further findings are that the car kilometers driven decreased by three percent compared to 2010.However, the use of public transport has increased by eight percent.

Under current / / how many kilometers do Mr. and Mrs. Schweizer trace a year?What bicycles are the most popular?
Where are most bicycles sold?Numbers and facts about Veloland Switzerland.Michael Baumannder Schweizer likes to move- regardless of whether as a passenger in an airplane or train, as a car or motorcyclist or as a cyclist with your own muscle strength.
A total of almost 20,000 kilometers per year and person should be.No nation is on the move.In Switzerland, you benefit from the individual mobility of well -developed streets and beautiful landscapes, which lures you outside, which also leads to considerable leisure traffic.
Interestingly, the bicycle and car market are about the same: around 320,000 of these vehicles are sold in Switzerland every year.There are also 50,000 motorcycles and scooters a year.
The entire Velo -Fuhrpark comprises an estimated 3.9 million bikes, such as Velosuisse, the Association of Swiss bicycle manufacturers and suppliers.Around 2.9 million of them are moved regularly.Last year, exactly 324 581 new bicycles in Germany changed hands, as can be seen from the statistics of Velosuisse.
This value corresponds to a slight plus of half a percent in the previous year, but is a long -term average.Remained stable during the overall sales, shifts among the segments have arisen.The electrovelos are still in the upswing, and for years.
Around 75,000 pieces of all sold bicycles had an engine up to 25 or 45 km / h to support.This is an increase of 14 percent compared to 2015 and means that almost every fourth bike is no longer driven with pure muscle strength.A total of over 400,000 e-bikes are already in use in Switzerland.
The most popular are the electric bicycles with the smaller engine: 60,000 buyers opted for it.For comparison, a look into the past: a decade earlier, in 2006, only 3200 customers bought an e-bike.Since then, of course, the offer has increased and the performance of the batteries has improved.
The prices have also dropped.In the beginning, e-bikes were difficult, came almost 25 kilometers and were considered uncool.In the meantime, these bicycles also look really good, are partly made of light carbon and drive with a load for well over a hundred kilometers.
Today's e-bikes are available from a thousand francs, but a quality product costs a little more.The most sought -after bike of Ms. and Mr. Schweizer still remains the city bike, that with 28 inches tall and without a motor.Exactly 17.1 percent of all bicycles sold were on this segment in 2016.
The mountain bike with 27.5-inch wheels follows just behind, which has reached 16.7 percent in the total of the total.The e-city bike with 28-inch wheels and support up to 25 Tempo 25 is already in third place. A safe bank is the children and adolescents.
Almost 50,000 vehicles across all categories- racing, leisure, freestyle and mountain bikes- go to the offspring every year.Suit, tie, e-bike bikes are increasingly used for the way to work.This can be up to twenty kilometers long.
Modern men in a suit and tie who drive to the office with an electrovelo are no longer uncommon.Business women are also more and more dared on the bike with a motor.With an e-bike you drive cheaply and are usually faster on the road than by car, bus or train.
As a look at the statistics shows, more and more electrovelos can also be found in the leisure area.There is a shift of normal mountain bikes to those with a motor.21,000 e-mountain bikes were sold in 2016:
In the previous year comparison, this corresponds to an increase of 36 percent.The higher weight is more than made up of the external power.With such a bike, especially if you are not or not so fit, mountain tours can be done that you can only dream of.
The bike dealers also benefit from this development.The majority of E-Velos buys the customer from a specialist and not from the large distributor or on the Internet.Trust and advice play a major role here.
The fact that a service point is nearby, ideally at the place of residence, must not be underestimated.The boom at the e-bikes also has a downside: the number of accidents has also increased.
According to the statistics of the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra), there have been more accidents with e-bikes every year since 2012.And with it more injuries.The number of seriously injured e-bike drivers increased from 78 to 201 from 2012 to 2016.
In the same period of time, there were between 4 and 14 deaths each year, with no increase to be eliminated.The sports cars among bicycles most accidents with the participation of an e-bike driver are available in cities.As Roadcross, the Foundation for Road Safety, writes, caution should be exercised where all road users mixed and it has no separate traces.
According to Roadcross, increased attention and sensitization, especially the two -wheeler, are needed here.The police are also allowed to punish consistently.Around 5 percent of the total sales were in 2016 to the bicycles that can cost CHF 20,000: on the racing bits.
In absolute numbers there were 15,500 units - tendency stable.Here again there is a parallel to the car market: like the sports car, the racing bike is a niche product, but one with great added value.

Veloweg instead of parking spaces / / tox.·
After a long back and forth, a continuous Veloweg is to be created on the rapidly rising Leimbachstrasse in Zurich Stadtkreis 2, as the Switzerland traffic club (VCS) reports.The city originally wanted to create a bike path on a section.She wanted to do without it between the Soodstrasse and the Maneggrärade because street parking spaces should have given way.
Since there is still a neighborhood bus on the route and the cars are traveling much faster than the bicycles, the VCS considered the route to be too dangerous without bike strips, despite the planned Tempo 30 regime.After the association had two objections in 2013 and 2016, the city has now given up, the VCS writes.The parking spaces have already been compensated for.

Because of dust: bike tent for civil servants / / by Martin Regenass Basel.
The city of Bern wants to mouse a bike offensive to the Velo capital of Switzerland.People are supposed to drive more bike because the bike is cheap and space -saving and fits the urban lifestyle like the beard to the hipster.The Basel construction and traffic department (BVD) of SP government councilor Hans-Peter Wessels recently formulated the same goal.
In the so -called Masterplan Velo, the Bernese make the Bernese a declaration of war.They want to become the most bike -friendly city in Switzerland.The Veloring, which the Basel voters sent more bachab with clear at the end of May, should be introduced with the Masterplan Velo by the back door and “safe” and “comfortable”.
A small tube, which concretely means and how the value of the bike can be increased, is now showing the BVD in front of its own home.In the cathedral courtyard on Münsterplatz, those responsible had a white tent set up.It measures about eight to eight meters.
Such tents-simply in greater execution-can usually be found at swing festivals or 1. August celebrations.However, the tent in the cathedral courtyard is not intended for a party, but serves as a parking hall for bicycles by employees of the cantonal administration.Dreck is determined on saddles
Recently carried out counting on site showed that around 20 employees made use of the tent.The shelter was thus occupied by about half during the holiday season.The reason for this bike carage is a construction site.
The BVD will be converted from Münsterplatz to the Dufourstrasse in the course of a partial move.Since the building at Rittergasse 4 is converted into a school building, rooms and rooms are upgraded to the latest standards regarding fire protection or handicapped equality.Toilets are also renovated or new IT cables are drawn and the cafeteria is enlarged.
In the course of this construction work, it has become necessary to build a concrete silo next to the tent.This barrel and the construction site create dust that contaminates the bicycles of the BVD employees.The construction site butt can settle on the saddles of the bicycles and the wreaths, changers and brakes are stirred up.
Even more serious: fine dust could affect and paralyze the electronic systems of e-bikes.As BVD media spokesman Marc Keller says on request, this was the decisive reason to set up the tent for a period of one year.For example, those responsible at the BVD decided to surround the eight department internal electrovelos including charging stations from the atrium at Münsterplatz and to convert them into the Domhof.
Keller states: «We had to accommodate them protected.»However, the electrovelos have now been supplied again in the bicycle and no longer in the tent that continues to stand in front of the buildings.In addition to protection against construction site dust, the tent serves as a second main function.
Since the cathedral courtyard has been serving as a parking space for bicycles for a long time, the tent guarantees a clear separation between parked bicycles and the construction site area, according to the Keller.This is intended to prevent the employees from placing their bicycles into the passage line of the construction site vehicles."The advantages of the tent are obvious: space savings, security and exclusion of mutual disabilities," says Keller.
Although a mutual oneself would have been possible without a tent and can be realized with barrier grilles, the protective function before dust and dirt was considered important.As an inspection shows on site, there are also cars of the BVD in the courtyard in addition to the bicycles.It is striking that the BVD has not raised dust protection for the cars.
Why this is the case, although the departmental cars are a lot more expensive than electrovelos, Keller does not respond to this question.Costs of CHF 8100 There are at Rittergasse 4, in front of another building of the BVD, bike racks and space for bicycles and the construction site wing does not reach there, it does not seem to be reasonable for employees who are around 50 meters from these bicycle places on footto cover your workplace around the corner at the Domhof.Keller does not answer why this short walk is unreasonable.
On the other hand, he names the costs for the tent at CHF 8100 for the year construction period.In contrast to a similar tent, which the Basel Wednesday company (BMG) wanted to set up on private ground for a few days as a bar near the musical theater for a few days, no building permit is necessary for the Velo tent in the Domhof.Keller: «The tent in the cathedral courtyard is not on Allmend, but on a private parcel and is set up as part of the building site installation and as a provisional.

Survey to do and bike / / / Thun in an online survey, the population can be able to cycle in the city by the end of November.
In the last survey, Thun ranked in midfield with regard to bike friendliness.After 2005, 2009 and 2013, Pro Velo Switzerland will lead a national survey for cycling for the fourth time under the title “Prix Velostede” this autumn
through .The Thun city administration announced that yesterday.
In around 30 questions, the population can be out of November 30th at www.velostaedte.ch on topics such as traffic climate, security, comfort, route network or storage options.Partners of the campaign are the Federal Office for Strasse as well as various large and medium -sized Swiss cities.A comparison of the results shows the cities involved, where they are in comparison with others regarding bike -friendliness and funding, how they are even better focusing on the needs of the population and what measures they can implement.
Competition prices are also raffled among the participants of the survey, including an electrovelo and an city bike.At the last implementation in 2013, Burgdorf, Chur and Winterthur swung the most bike -friendly cities above.Thun took 15th place and is thus in midfield.

The Velo-Banche / / The Zurich company Notime conquered the Switzerland's bicycle industry.Your business model: Sharing-Economy.
But now the successful start-up gets trouble.Martin Sturzeneggeram March 17th, Thomas Diem * drives through a busy Zurich road on his racing bike.
Time is running out .The bicycle has to extend several deliveries that day.Just when he mentally adjusted the route plan, the driver takes a full braking in front of him.
Diem can no longer react, it bounces into the vehicle.The consequences: a knee bruise, a damaged wheel and seven weeks inability to work.They are the weeks in which Diem has to do without wages.
At that moment, he cannot count on his employer, the Kurier company notime.The Zurich start-up has previously declared its employees as a "self-employed person", similar to how the US taxi company Uber does.This means that the couriers are neither insured nor do they receive wage replacement, holidays or social security contributions.
"That put me in existential difficulties," says Diem.The damage to his bike was CHF 200.He refrained from visiting a doctor - to prevent additional costs.
The “Tages-Anzeiger” knows of other notime cures who happened to have something similar: broken shoulders, struck teeth or hand injuries.They state that they have arisen for the costs themselves."We risk our lives on the street - I expect a certain accommodation from the employer," says Diem.
The Suva leads bike on the list of the ten most dangerous jobs.Now notime is implementing a measure that she originally decided in March.From October 1st, the company would like to hire over 300 drivers.
"This will become the canton that is probably the fastest growing employer," says co -founder Philipp Antoni.He describes his company as a "pioneer", as a "pioneer" within the sharing economy, which usually does not require any permanent positions.The representatives of the aspiring business branch, including companies such as Uber or Airbnb, do not see themselves as an employer, but as a provider of a technology platform.
Those who use them commercially are not employees, but self -employed.At notime, the bicycles were previously referred to as "freelancers".Despite the announced employee status, not all couriers are satisfied.
This week, a group protested under the guidance of the Unia in Bern.Today the union and driver in Zurich want to discuss the further procedure.Your goal: better conditions for the employment contract.
"The contracts are extremely doubtful," says Roman Künzler from Unia.His main point of criticism: the lack of remuneration for the "bogus self -employment", which had been achieved by the couriers in the past two years.The subsequent claims concern social benefits, holiday money, surcharges for Sundays and holidays or night work. "We cannot help you" "We are irritated by protest," says Antoni.
The conversation was searched with the couriers to achieve a solution.Nevertheless, notime reacted.At the request of the TA, the co-managing director announces that “certain corrections” have now been made in the contract.
First and foremost, all social security contributions that have occurred since 2015 are now to be paid for the SVA and thus the drivers."Even those who no longer work with us," says Antoni.With Maximilian Kunz *, which is also among the protesters, this should be well received.
In the past few months, the KURIER has felt what it means to work as a "bogus self -employed".A year ago he contacted SVA to settle his social security contributions independently.A few months later, he got knowing that this would not be possible because the Suva classified him as "dependent".
He only made his worker available, it said in the reply: «You borrow yourself.“Kunz wanted to retrospectively request this from notime.
The answer email followed in summer: Unfortunately, one could not hand over it because he is not an employee: «Sorry, we cannot help you.“For Kunz, months passed in financial uncertainty.
Large orders from SBB and Postin of this time the further development of notime progressed rapidly.From Zurich, the company has been expanding to seven other Swiss cities since 2015.It has been running in South Africa since the beginning of the year.
The expansion was carried out, although the company has not made any franc to win.In the background there are wealthy donors.The most prominent is Michael Hauser.
The Zurich agricultural entrepreneur has a fortune of around CHF 850 million and figures in 142 of the “balance sheet” ranking of the richest Swiss.Notime does not reveal how much investor money has flowed to this day.The company overtook the competition at a rapid pace.
For comparison: Veloblitz, the city's largest bicycle for years, now employs 80 drivers - all social insured.Competitor Notime employs almost 300 bike in Zurich alone.Veloblitz managing director
Katharina Brandenberger speaks of uneven skewers: «Notice was able to save himself a high premium for two years.»During this time, notice not only secured the favor of investors, but also those of state companies SBB and Post.
Both work closely with the company.With the Kaloka platform, the mail relies on the Same-Day Delivery principle: the customer selects its products from over 100 shops in Bern and Zurich.
The order takes place online, the house delivery takes over notime.A 24-hour express delivery service that requires maximum flexibility.When asked about the at least questionable social compatibility of the partner company, says mail spokeswoman Jacqueline Bühlmann: «Regarding working conditions, we were looking for a conversation with notime at the beginning of the year.»
Post had already concluded the first contract with a notime in spring 2016.At that time, the work circumstances in the start-up were well known.The “Daily Week” posted the post for the last December: last December:
"Should the post do forego market -friendly solutions of the future and die in beauty?" Now, two years after the company was founded, Notime makes his workers employees.Why not earlier?"There was an unclear legal situation at the time of the company," says Antoni.
The "overriding" was on the right track at the time.* To see names of the editorial team changed in Zurich:
The green-black tenüs of the notice drivers.Photo: Doris Fanconishing Economyin Trend is braked unions and certain politicians criticize the Sharing-Economy business model as exploitative.They warn of the "conviction" that are threatening to go to all branches of business:
Companies that benefit from cheap workers without offering legal certainty in return: there is usually no protection against dismissal, holidays or social security.Since the beginning of the year, the air has become thinner for the sharing economy in Switzerland.In January, the Suva Uber driver's accident insurance declared a claim from social security contributions as an employee.
In June she announced the same for notice drivers.The companies deal with it differently.While Uber surprisingly hired his low service in Zurich in Zurich, Notime dares to take the step on the offensive and is now becoming an employer.

Stele is supposed to strengthen the group feeling of cyclists / / by Martin Regenass Basel.You have long had bike cities with a bike like the Westfälische Münster: stelae who show the number of cyclists cycling past the bike route on the bike route.
Since Basel is supposed to move up to the Swiss Velostadt number one according to the government councilor's master plan, a bike counting station should of course not be missing here.Recently, the Office for Mobility of the Construction and Traffic Department (BVD) followed a suit from the Green Grand Council Thomas Grossenbacher and has given up such a counting facility for CHF 16,000 on the Grossbasler side of the Wettstein Bridge.The construction and traffic department pays the amount.
However, as tests on site show, the station does not count every bike that drives through.Only those bikes that drive directly over the diamonds from wire that are upstream to the counter are counted.If you pass the bike in the middle of the wire that lies between the diamonds, the counter does not appeal.
Nicole Stocker, spokeswoman for the BVD, says that internal surveys have made a very high level of accuracy."Every bike counts" is written on the counting station, which can count a maximum of 1.8 million bicycles per year.The date is also listed, which alternates with the time, and the number of bicycles driven per day and year.
According to Stocker, it should be shown that every bike ride contributes to relieving the city streets.Stocker: "So there is more space on the street for those car travelers who rely on the car." Use unknown david Wüest-Rudin, President of Pro Velo of both Basel, the counting point generally welcomes, even if this is not a priority bicycle support measure.The stele shows how intensively the street infrastructure is also used by bike drivers.
Wüest-Rudin: «You can see past that you are part of the bike community.In addition, the numbers are collected by the BVD.»
Driving is something good, and the counting point is also a kind of advertising measure.Wüest-Rudin does not believe whether the counting station to bring people from the car to the bike.«The stele motivates people to drive bike when you see the large number of bikers.»
It supports people in keeping how important it is to drive bike.Urs Gerhard thinks nothing of the publication of the number of passing cyclists.The traffic psychologist from the University of Basel has taken a inspection on site.
He almost had to search for the stele, says Gerhard.It is small and lying behind a telephone cabin.«Hardly a cyclist who drives past is looking at it.»
At night when the stele lamps, it will probably be better perceived.According to Gerhard, the information content is “zero”.“Numbers of passages are important for traffic planners so that you know whether you have to attach changes to a street.

With a lot of luxury against the bike growth / / for around CHF 14 million, the city of Zurich built a luxurious bike station at the Sihlpost.With many extras, cyclists are to be prompted to solve an annual subscription for CHF 180.
Daniel Fritzschefilippo Leutenegger is in the element.The FDP civil engineering head leads through the new Bicycle station in Europaplatz, which has been in operation since Tuesday and offers parking spaces for 1600 bicycles."Welcome to our luxury temple," he says in the middle of the large, underground hall.
It is pleasantly warm and everything is brightly lit.The bicycles can be parked in rows spelled without being exposed to the weather.Gine at the main entrance
"Züri rolls" employee, an integration program of the Asylum Organization Zurich.They take care of the bicycles and keep the system in good shape."This comfort is unique," enthuses the landlord.
The SBB underpass of the main train station can be reached through direct access and is on the right perron in no time.For special bikes such as cargo bikes, there are separate parking spaces, as well as for e-bikes, with the associated charging stations.The offer also includes lockers, a pumping station, a repair corner, 24-hour video monitoring and an automatic access system.
Skeptic vcsall The luxury has its price.The city cost around CHF 14 million the magnificent station.Part of it is paid from the agglomeration program.
The construction goes back to a motion in the city parliament.Today's finance manager Daniel Leupi (Gp.) Entered this eleven years ago with his party colleague Bastien Girod.Civil engineering head of people people describes the investment today as an “important milestone in bike promotion”.
This also justifies the high price.Many “Velopendler” already lead from their home to the train stations today and then continue to travel by public transport.Slow traffic is further promoted with comfortable bike stations like this.
This is completely in the spirit of the “City Transport 2025” program. Now only the cyclists have to play along.The underground parking spaces with all -round service are not free.A day ticket costs 2 francs per bike.
A monthly ticket can be obtained for CHF 20 and an annual subscription for CHF 180."With these income, we want to run the company cost -neutral," says Menschenegger.The question is whether the Zurichers will really notice the offer.
So far, they park your bikes for free where it fits.A bicycle growth is the result in many places.Feensegger: «After a while I think many will notice the advantages of the station.»
You get an excellent service for a small obolus.So that the Zurichers can convince themselves of this, they can use the station free of charge by the end of October with a trial subscription.Will this be enough to convince bikers?
Markus Knauss, green city parliamentarian and VCS managing director, is skeptical.The new bike station is actually "a real profit".In order for the “wild parking” to stop, some of the newly created parking spaces must be available free of charge, he demands.
He speaks of about half of all places.At a meeting with City Councilor Menschenegger, it was agreed that at least 350 above -ground free parking spaces along the Sihl should be preserved until further notice.At the same time, Knauss submitted a advance in the city parliament.
As a request that some of the 1600 new places should be free underground, Filippo Leutenegger is cautious on request."At least we should keep ourselves open," he says.One had to note that paying customers could feel disadvantaged over non -counters.
Further parking spaces are planned in Zurich. Further generous bike stations will be created in Zurich - with a total of 10,000 parking spaces.At the Stadelhofen, 1000 underground places are planned in Calatrava's architectural bead;Similar projects are planned at the Altstetten and Hardbrücke train stations.
The bike tunnel under the main train station is also pushed forward.Additional covered parking spaces are to be created there.According to the HB, there is a total of 5000 pieces at the HB.
The ramp that leads from the Sihlpost side into the tunnel already exists today.It is the access of the newly opened luxury bike station.It will take a while until the bicycles can flit under the HB.

Traffic jams on Copenhagen's bicycle / / in downtown Copenhagen more bicycles than cars.This leads to columns on the bike strip and a fight for the square on the street.
The first bike guidance system worldwide is supposed to help.Niels Anner, Copenhagenes is like a major demonstration when commuting rolls on two wheels in the morning.The bike strip does not become a car, but a bicycle tray.
The bicycle paths in Copenhagen are now four to five meters wide along important streets.Nevertheless, their capacity reaches its limits: In red light, the bicycles are stowing at neuralgic points on hundreds of meters, a green phase is too short to push the pulc.
There are green waves adapted to the two -wheelers, but it still leads to bottle necks.Especially when a construction site or a car blocks the river on the intersection.In addition to the optimization of traffic lights, the city is currently testing the-probably the first-first-Velo guidance system with electronic scoreboards.
These provide information about alternative routes with fewer traffic at five main streets and show travel times for various destinations.However, the benefits of the boards are controversial;Many see them as a symbol that the left -wing city government wants to give bike drivers even more priority.
More bicycles as Autos2016 were counted more bicycles than cars in Copenhagen on the streets into and from the city center for the first time.On the way to work or training, according to the surveys of this year, 62 percent of commuters take the bike within the city, only 9 percent the car.If the agglomeration is also taken into account, the car share is 24 percent, that of public transport at 30 percent and the bike share at 41 percent.
This means that Copenhagen is still missing a piece by the goal set for 2025: Then 50 percent of the commuter paths are to be covered on the bike.But the question of space inevitably arises.
Because the distribution of the street is also a problem in Copenhagen.The responsible city councilor Morten cable recognizes the protests of bourgeois politicians and frustrated drivers;
He does not want to close the city to the cars, also out of consideration for the business.But Copenhagen, which has stuck out ambitious climate goals, wants to give the majority of the population right of way and give more space, says Kabell, i.e. bike and public transport.The city also argues with the efficiency on the street: measurements show that 2.5 times as many people can be transported on a bike path per hour as on a car trail.
On the Queen Louise Bridge, where the car traces were reduced and bike strips were widened, the number of people has grew by a fifth since 2008.Up to 48,000 bicycles cross the bridge every day.Satisfaction could sink a extensive ranking, Copenhagen was once again chosen as the best bike city in the world in 2017, in front of Utrecht and Amsterdam.
One reason for this is millions of investments, including 16 Velobrücken, which the Danish capital has already built or planned: architectural litters, but above all car -free and time -saving connections to the city.According to a city survey, the general satisfaction of cyclists is 97 percent;76 percent of the cycling Copenhageners feel safe.
But the traffic jams on the bike warns the study, questioning the city's leadership role.Because speed is the main reason for a clear majority to climb to bike.Environmental ideas hardly play a role.
The parking situation also causes problems.Local media speak of a bicycle chaos that causes thousands of “wild” two-wheelers.Here a fully automatic parking garage developed in Japan is to remedy this:
The bike is handed over to the system, then shipped from a lift and robot system to a free stand- and later delivered to the owner that is adopted with a chip card.This solution is also not cheap: an attempt is planned with a first, equivalent of almost CHF 2 million.

SP demands free travel for bicycles / / The left launch a new initiative: you will charge 50 kilometers of car -free routes in Zurich until 2030.
The SP wants to put pressure on the city and its master plan.EV Manzzurich is subscribed to on top positions in international comparisons.But there is also a ranking, because the city is completely missing:
In the worldwide comparison of the bike cities, the Copenhagen index, Zurich is not even managed.In terms of bicycle traffic, even Winterthur and Bern are better than Zurich.The SP of the city of Zurich now wants to change that:
It stands behind the bike route initiative, which is to be launched at the end of November.In surveys, bicycles of the city of Zurich give bad grades.Half does not feel safe in city traffic.
In 2016, more accidents with bicycles occurred in the city than ever (after all, it is significantly less with severe personal injury).The verdict of bicycle experts: the network is a piece of work - a clear bike strategy cannot be seen.The popular initiative “Safe Velorouuten for Zurich” calls for 50 kilometers of car -free bicycles in the city to reduce the number of accidents.
Only cyclists are allowed on these, they always have progressed and do not have to pay attention to crossings from left and right.In short: they make it safe and quick on these routes.Exceptions are only intended for residents and the trade.
The municipal code, in which the implementation of a continuous velonetz is already anchored, is to be supplemented accordingly.The city has ten years of the initiative at the city council for preliminary examination.According to co -nitine Anna Graff, she has the goal that Zurich is better off compared to other bike cities.
Oliver Heimgartner, member of the SP management, adds: «The initiative is a visionary, urgently needed progress in the area of bicycle.»Members of the Greens, the AL and the GLP as well as the interest organization Provelo and by traffic are also represented in the committee.The initiators demand that existing municipal streets are converted into bike routes by new signals.
At the latest ten years after the provision comes into force, a network of star -shaped and tangential bike routes is to cover the city.There is already a list of possible bike breeds.The firm is listed over a length of 1 kilometer, the Dufouroder Mühlebachstrasse (around 1.5 kilometers), the wine -growing heap (1 kilometer), Scheuchzerstrasse (1.74 kilometers) or Regensbergstrasse (2.48 kilometers) is policyThe order has long been granted to improve cycling in the city of Zurich.
The Velo master plan has existed since 2012.It is a central element of the “City Transport 2025” program.Up to eight years, twice as many people in the city of Velo should drive than in 2011.
The people approved a framework loan of CHF 120 million in promoting bicycle traffic in 2015, and the city council decided annually a construction program VELO.The list of measures includes the Velor route from the main train station via Löwenund Talstrasse to the lake.Important gaps, such as those on the Langstrasse, are not yet closed.
Dave Durner, the managing director of Pro Velo, says: «The city has clearly known to promote bike transport, but has hardly implemented it.The initiative should now force them to do so.»SP councilor Florian Utz argues similarly:
There have been “hardly any substantial projects” in recent years."That is why the voice of the people is now needed." The city, on the other hand, wants to promote traffic safety differently, as Wernher Brucks, head of traffic safety, explained on Wednesday, on the first day of traffic safety.Six educational films are supposed to sensitize cyclists to dangers.
And they are supposed to show that it is often safer for cyclists to do without the advance.The city gets support from traffic psychologist Markus Hackenfort, professor at Zhaw.In his view, bicycles relied far too much on markings.
It is necessary to free the bicycles from “false certainties”, he told the NZZ. Silas Hobi from the club sees.The only safe and consistent bike routes could prevent accidents.In most cases, the opponents of collision are the main causes - that is, drivers.
The test track serves as a model: the Zurich Velo-Highway in Circle 6 at the intersection of Scheuchzer-/Riedlistrasse.Photo: Urs Jaudas -related pioneering work more space for the bike thanks to dynamic traffic routing with a new concept, Bellerivestrasse and Utoquai are to be used more efficiently.
The city council wants to check a changing use of letting.Corsin Zander During the renovation of the Bellerivestrasse, no new bike routes are planned.From 2019, the central axis of invisibility in the city is to be renewed for CHF 64 million.
Numerous objections were received against the city's project.The SP and Greens demand to reduce the four traces of the Bellerivestrasse and the Utoquais to two to make space for bike paths - an unrealistic measure because it would have to be approved by the canton.The motion of the two GLP councilors Markus Merki and Matthias Wiesmann offers an innovative compromise.
She calls for a three -year pilot test with a dynamic traffic routing.The four traces should be reduced to three, with the middle lane in the morning, when most cars drive into the city, in the evening out of town.The traffic would be guided by switch signals and lights built into the ground.
In its response to motion, the city council shows willingness to take care of the topic.However, he applies for the conversion of the motion into a less binding postulate.With a traffic study, the city council wants to investigate whether the dynamic traffic routing could be introduced.
The fact that the city council considers the idea unrealistic emerges from its answer.Dynamic traffic routing is unrealistic in the close urban space, the space gain for bike traces is too low and in general: the measures would cost too much money.
Motionär Wiesmann does not want to make it that easy for the city council.The idea has great potential: «The project would be a pioneering performance for larger European cities.»The municipal councils from South and North American cities were inspired, which know a corresponding traffic regime.
However, there are also multi -lane highways in these places that lead to the city centers.For Wiesmann it is clear: There are not many streets in Zurich that have several traces and are enough wide to implement dynamic traffic routing.
"But it would be worth checking for the Bellerivestrasse and the Utoquai," says the GLP council.Therefore, you have to think about whether you did not want to hold on to a motion.A majority for this would find the GLP together with the SP and the Greens.

Velos and May 1st / / Spiez at the SP SPIEZ section meeting were the bike infrastructure and the 1st May celebration.
A lot could still be improved on the bike infrastructure in Spiez, this was shown by Jürg Wittwer, President of Pro Velo Region Spiez, at the SP Spiez section.Bicycle users in our region and throughout the Oberland could only dream of the conditions in Holland, Germany or South Tyrol.Among other things, it should be possible to better protect the weakest road users from accidents with separate lanes and safe intersections, said Wittwer.
The improvement of the bike infrastructure also helps the environment.Unlike, for example, in the Lake Constance area or in South Tyrol, many in Germany have not yet cleared the great potential in this tourism branch.So it would also be financially worthwhile to invest in attractive regional bicycle paths.
The SP board at the meeting saidA new shape is to be sought and tried out for the next few years.The assembly participants authorized the board to take appropriate steps.

New Veloweg from Worb to Deisswil / / Worblental between Worb and Deisswil is to be a direct and safe bike path.
The regional conference has developed a best variant.Driving is said to be more attractive and relieve motorized traffic.This is also intended in the upper Worblental.
For this reason, the regional conference Bern Mittelland (RKBM) developed so -called everyday velor routes.Such a bike path will also lead from Deisswil to Worb in the future.The best variant drawn up by the RKBM leads from Deisswil via Utzlenbergstrasse, Wylerweg, Nesselbank and Bodengasse to Worb.
Existing, largely paved infrastructure is used."The Traffic Commission regrets that the route between Stettlen and Nesselbank cannot run along the Worlle due to reasons of water protection - asphalting is not possible there," says the message.To what extent the federal and canton would take part in the project is still in clarification, writes the RKBM.
The proposed route is approved for public participation until the end of January 2018. The documents can be viewed on the website www.bernmittelland.ch.PD / ABEGEGENPLANDE everyday life

"There is always space for bicycle paths - if you want" / / Zurich is predestined for bicycle traffic, says Dutch expert Saskia Kluit.But only with car -free bike routes as they demand the left.
Is the Velostadt Zurich known with Saskia Kluit Language Language.If I had to list the ten cities with the best bicycles worldwide, Zurich would not belong.But Zurich shows at least ambitions with his master plan to change something.
The city is almost predestined for more bicycle traffic.Zurich is hilly, which is unfavorable for cycling.Where do you see Zurich's potential?
As is well known, Switzerland is a hiking.The Swiss - and with it the Zurich - like to move, including uphill.In addition, the Swiss have an affinity for e-bikes-just like we Dutch.
The SP of the city of Zurich wants to build 50 kilometers of car -free bicycle paths in the city.Today she launches an initiative for this.Is that a step towards Velostadt?
Definitely .A network of routes on which bicycles and cars are run separately is the central means of bicycle promotion.On the other hand, the cyclists to raise more sensitivity to risks and dangers is of little use.
Why ?On separated routes, safety for cyclists is greater than on normal wheel strips.It does not count the measurable security, but whether the cyclists feel safe.
If this is the case, more people drive bike - then children use the bike for school and seniors for short excursions.In addition, every driver who is also on the bike behaves more freely towards bike drivers.The Zurich city council refers to the limited place in the city when demanding for separate routes.
That means everywhere.If you look closely, it is not true.The cars need too much space.
Many streets are not used efficiently enough.Let's take a street with rows of parking space on both sides.In the cars that drive into the city on this street, only one person sits.
If you pick up the rows of parking space and replace them by separated bicycle paths, it could move many times over cyclists in the city.The space for separated bicycle pedestrian paths can always be created if you want.The bourgeois parties are completely different.
Wrongly .Some car drivers would switch to bike if the conditions would be better.This means that car traffic would take off, and driving would be more pleasant.
The latest studies show that the most bike -friendly cities are also the most car -friendly.The bourgeois parties should also be aware: the promotion of bicycle traffic also has a savings effect in the long term.
Where exactly do you see this?The health costs decrease.Bicycles are healthier, physically and mentally.
On the bike you are constantly in contact with the environment and other people.In addition, the public space is stimulated by cyclists, the crime drops, which also lowers the costs.In addition, savings could be made in public transport because it would be less frequented.
Are there any other advantages?In addition, bicycles strengthen the trust of the city dwellers because they have to take into account one another when driving in larger groups.In short: Safe cycling makes a city happy and worth living - of course also applies to Zurich.

Velo-Mania in the Bundeshaus / / the federal government should now be responsible for Velowege.Not only left -wing circles, but also bourgeois politicians.
Saving is different.Driving is hip.Every Swiss city that keeps something on itself spoils its cyclists today with panoramic or fast routes and plans bridges especially for bicycles.
An armada of gear wheels is supposed to lure the population onto the saddles, and with bike offensives you want to make it clear to the back last that bike is not only environmentally conscious and cheap, but also cool.Velomania has now also recorded the Bundeshaus.The occasion is a popular initiative that wants to anchor the bicycle paths in the federal constitution and which the Council of States will treat these days.
Behind the request is a group of left-wing parties, environmental and bike associations.As almost always when it comes to state expansion, there are also freedom-minded federal parliamentarians, according to Olivier Français (Vaud), Christa Markwalder (Bern) or the New National Council and former Ticino cyclist Rocco Cattaneo.Now bike paths are actually a very local affair.
One would think that the cantons and the communities best know where a bike strip should go through and how wide it is.The federal government also has to do different than to take care of bicycle paths.In Bundesbern you can see it differently.
The Federal Council is so impressed by the initiative of the initiative that it has compared it to a direct counter -draft.The planned constitutional article is a bit more reserved than the initiative, but takes up its core concern.It would not be surprising if the initiators delay their desire at the end.
Specifically, the state government suggests that the federal government, as it is already doing in the foot and hiking trails, also determines principles for bicycle path networks that it can support cantons and private bike organizations and supply the population with information on bike.The Federal Council assures that you will go to work cautiously here.However, if you hear where there is a need for action everywhere-in the cities-the last gaps can be closed on the net, in the agglomeration to create routes for Velopendler, to build mountain bike routes in the mountains-you can assume that the federal administrationWork will not go out so quickly.
How high the costs of the new federal task will be is open.The Federal Council assumes CHF 1.8 million and 2.5 full -time positions per year;Whether that is enough will only be shown in the concrete implementation.
The topography cannot be smoothed of consultation for the planned bike constitutional article was still excited.FDP and SVP rejected the project circular.There are already enough cantonal or municipal initiatives for bike transport, said the FDP.
If comparatively little bike is driven in Switzerland, this is due to the topography of the country, and this does not allow Millioners PR campaigns to be smoothed, according to the SVP.These findings have apparently not arrived in their own parliamentarians.The traffic commission of the Council of States, which includes four Social Democrats four CVP members, four free-senses and one SVP man, unanimously supports the template.

A new idea for Zurich's largest bike problem / / Nobody is satisfied with the situation on Rämistrasse.The VCS has a proposal - the pedestrians would have to give way.
Werner Schüepfür Velo driver have some large, unsolved “construction sites” in the city center of the city - and then there is the Rämistrasse between Kunsthaus / Heimplatz and Bellevue.There is probably the largest “construction site”.
Actually, it is impossible to squeeze two wheel strips into this tight, gorge -like road.However, the regional execution plan has been providing a Velor route there since 1999, and the local council has always insisted on this matter.In 2015, the city wanted to steer the bicycles uphill onto the sidewalk and only offer a narrow strip downwards.
The local council declined.He asked for a real, functional bike route.pavement
Must muster traffic club in Switzerland (VCS), Zurich section, now proposes a solution that, despite close space, would be feasible according to his own statement.It is important for the VCS that the proposal can be implemented quickly and that none of the other road users affect.
"We have drawn up a solution in which a continuous Veloweg on Rämistrasse Bergwie is possible," says Hans Jörg Käppeli, project manager, VCS board member and SP council.And without shifting the existing wall or changes in the existing tram tracks.In order to make space on the narrow Rämistrasse, the VCS suggests simply leaving the sideways on the side of the High Promenade car park.
This creates the necessary space for a 1.8 meter wide and safe bike track.The pedestrians either use the wide sidewalk on the opposite side along the houses on Rämistrasse or have a footpath above the wall of Rämistrasse.The footpath along the Rämistrasse 23 to 27 house is significantly widened - contrary to the urban proposals in March 2015.
Käppeli: "Instead of a 1.82 -meter -wide sidewalk along the Rämistrasse on the west side, an at least 2.6 meter wide sidewalk can be offered." In order to enable a bicycle path and at the same time a wider sidewalk, car traffic and trams have to be availableDivide the trail of a small section.Thanks to the new traffic routing of the tram on the home place (postponement of the tram stop) and an intelligent light signal system on the home square, on the tent path and on the Hirschengraben, traffic can be controlled in such a way that a smooth tram operation could be guaranteed and that according to VCS, no capacity reduction and no traffic jamfor car traffic.The VCS takes up the idea of visualizing the civil engineering part of the person access to the parking garage along Rämistrasse and offering it new above the retaining wall of Rämistrasse.
A passenger noisle via Rämistrasse is intended to enable access from the car park to the Hirschengraben, to the home square and the old town."The adjustments to the parking garage are easy because the city of Zurich herself is the owner of the Hohen promenade car park," says VCS project manager Käppeli.It is clear that the existing footpaths (Caroline-Farner-Weg, Olgaweg and Hohe Promenade) can be made more attractive.
Urban solution too expensive? ”Our project represents a suitable solution and is not simply an unrealistic business game,” says Markus Knauss, co-managing director of VCS Zurich.He thus alludes to the exemption from FDP City Councilor Filippo Menschenegger.
This presented his proposal at the beginning of the year.He wants to create a kind of Velobalcon on the Rämistrasse between Bellevue and Kunsthaus.The path should go to today's retaining wall at the cantonal school
High promenade are built.For Hans Jörg Käppeli this is not a solution: «The idea would lead to very high costs of CHF 20 to 30 million that nobody is willing to spend.»In addition, such a project requires a long project period with a correspondingly great risk of making an objection.
The VCS solution, on the other hand, can not only be realized faster, it even costs a fraction of people's proposal.Käppeli: "We expect around five million francs in our project." Stau, waiting times, collision criticism on the VCS proposal comes from a bourgeois side.FDP councilor Andreas Egli: «The proposal is certainly worth checking.
However, I am not very enthusiastic about the abolition of the sidewalk on the part of the parking garage.»In his opinion, this is hardly approved.
Egli is even less impressed by the mixing traffic for car and tram on Rämistrasse.There are traffic jams, waiting times and collisions."Fast journeys from and to the university hospital should not only be possible with the bike in the future." The use of the high promenade parking garage is clearly less customer -friendly, this is anyway the program for men Knauss and Käppeli.

Velo offensive spills over / / city of Bern to the holiday fair
Tomorrow the holiday fair starts on the Bernexpo site.This year's edition is all about the bike.The bike is the ideal means of transport for the city.
It is quick, cheap, keeps it healthy and stands for an urban lifestyle.The Bernese municipal council is praising his bike offensive, with which he wants to make Bern a bike capital and promote the quality of life.The organizers of the holiday fair on the Bernexpo site are also going on a bike offensive this year.
You make the bike a special topic at the fair that will open your doors tomorrow.It is no coincidence that the holiday fair is marked by the two -wheelers.Veloferien is becoming increasingly popular in Switzerland.
Whether sporty mountains, rapid trips with the mountain bike or cozy tours through the city - the opportunities to spend leisure and vacation on the bike are almost limitless.Trend discovered early on companies that discovered the trend of bike holidays thirty years ago, the bike school “MTBeer” from Interlaken is.Managing Director Housi Beer has specialized in bike fields in Tuscany.
What started as a hobby and personal training for cycling races is a business today.Every year the material and the technology would be better, says Beer, who is represented at the holiday fair with his company for the first time. "Bike holidays are interesting and very varied," said Beer.The fact that such active vacation has become a trend has also to do with doing something for your health and still enjoying time.
«Combined with holidays, of course, this is twice nice.“Individual bike holidays are also possible abroad, says the expert.Travelers who want to be traveling with the racing bike in Tuscany can do this with street cards from “Mtbeer”: “On trips with the mountain bike away from the street, however, because of the unknown site, tours are more useful.” Twenty bike exhibitors only in Italy, SpainOr France, but also in Switzerland, bike holidays are increasingly popular, for example on the Burgdorfer Herzroute, which leads from Lausanne to Rorschach.
The trade fair visitors can find out more about the route covered with flyer e-bikes.Velor routes in Eastern Switzerland or Zurich as well as exotic destinations such as Mauritius are also presented.The heart of the special exhibition at the holiday fair is formed in Hall 2.2 over 20 bike exhibitors such as Thömus, TCS or e-motion e-bike and two veloparcours with the names "Nature" and "Urban".
The Fun Cube is ready for daring-a wooden construction with a ramp in the middle of the hall, which is almost four meters high.As a special highlight, the trade fair organizers advertised the bike test.Here interested parties can create a hand and try out various bicycles and e-bikes.
If you want to know more about the bicycle tested after the trip, you can get advice from the experts.And if you are not interested in travel with the bike, you can be inspired otherwise.Whether city trip, beach holidays, adventures in the jungle or wellness vacation - the exhibitors are available to advise visitors.
Markus Ehinger vacation fair Bern: 11 a.m. to 14 January 2018, Thu, Sat and Sun: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.Fri: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.Mountain bike tour in front of a beautiful backdrop in Tuscany with Housi Beer (front in green) from Interlaken.

With the bike on the political lane.· The fact that the bike in the city of Zurich pulls as an election campaign horse becomes longer, the longer, the more clearly: In November one day, the SP collected 5000 signatures for its initiative "Safe Velorouuten for Zurich", and on Wednesday there is civil engineering Filippo Leutenegger (FDP.)Visible solutions for the bike tours on Rämistrasse and on Bellevue presented (see article on page 18) .nun, the majority of the municipal councils can also boast of strengthening bicycle traffic.
First of all, the parliament decided on Wednesday to drive the construction of four bicycle routes, on which cyclists are supposed to move forward free of trouble: on the width and low -cross paths and with a lead over the interfering traffic.Test of the Astramit 69 to 46 votes, the parliament has commissioned the city council to submit a loan -sophisticated instruction for its construction.The council lens and the GLP prevail against the bourgeois.
Specifically, bicycle routes between Altstetten and the city center (Basler-/Bulllingerstrasse), Unter- and Oberstrass (Sonnegg-/Scheuchzerstrasse), Affoltern and Oerlikon (Bachmannweg via Zelgli to Regensbergstrasse) as well as in Seefeld (Mühlebach-/Zollikerstrasse) are planned.The municipal council had already applied for it when the regional guideline revision revised.However, the government council broke them out again - with "flimsy justifications" in the eyes of the motionaires, which therefore wanted to exert pressure again so that Zurich finally made the "jump to an attractive velost city".
The city council would have preferred to accept the advance of the municipal councils Marco Denoth (sp.) And Sven Sobernheim (GLP.) As a postulate.The urban bike funding pursues the same goals, and the expansion of the sections of the route for bicycle traffic is planned or already implemented.Rapid routes are also only one of the possible measures to strengthen bicycle traffic.
In fact, it is not yet clear what advantages the bicycle roads or quick routes spread in Denmark or the Netherlands have and whether they are definitely introduced in Switzerland.In order to test this, the Federal Office of Strassen (Astra) has tried two sections of the route: Scheuchzerstrasse in Oberstrass and the Affoltern or Zelglistrasse in Zurich North.Against “Veloras' routes” to last October, cyclists had advance to the violent traffic;
A changed signaling and Velo pictograms on the asphalt pointed out this.However, the final report on the eleven -month attempt is still pending.The CVP wanted to see results, argued its city council candidate Markus Hungerbühler in the council debate.
As long as there were no existing, they didn't want to break anything over the knee.The FDP also joined this reasoning and expressed fundamental discomfort compared to such “bicycle cars” that could also lead to more accidents.The SVP came into the same horn: Bernhard in the Oberdorf was afraid of “bike bats”, and Derek Richter accused the motionaire to act like whipping “goofen”.
Unlike left-green green, the SVP runs traffic policy for everyone, not for a few.However, the supporters did not be put off and did not want to convert the motion into a postulate, as proposed by the city council.In vain, people had pointed out that a loan -sailing instruction for all four routes was not the right instrument and, in the end, too expensive.
The municipal council "back in the Velokirche", as Alexander Brunner (FDP.) Explained, was also commissioned to create the city council for the residents of the Freilagers and other Albisrieder from Rautistrasse to Albisriederplatz (83 YES-to release 32 no votes) and the "spider" to release the "spider" at Bucheggplatz for bike drivers (80 to 35 votes). However, it was shown how far the political camps are ready for cyclists and where the boundaries are.For example, the Greens voted against the Albisrieder Veloweg together with the SVP because its planning did not explicitly disregard to fall trees.

The bike balcony mutates into Höhenweg / / Stefan Hotzdie Situation for bike drivers on Rämistrasse between Bellevue and home square is unsatisfactory and has long been an issue.
A year ago, City Councilor Filippo Menschenegger, on the annual orientation through the projects of the civil engineering office, accompanied the idea of a bicycle path on the retaining wall.In the meantime, the proposal is so concrete that the overall city council was able to make an approving decision.However, no more two-wheelers on the building-which could soon be smiled at as a “bike balcony”-are to run, as Menschenegger announced on Wednesday at the new edition of the annual media conference.
The new high -trailer in front of the Hohe Promenade cantonal school, around three to four meters, is now to be available to foot goals.For Velos, the climb would be very strong from the Bellevue.A sidewalk comes along the sidewalk along the retaining wall is lifted.
This allows a bike strip to mark a bike strip on both sides of Rämistrasse at this neuralgic location.The sidewalk between Waldmannstrasse and Hirschengraben remains unchanged.Access to the Hohe Promenade car park for pedestrians is now only via the Höhenweg.
The exit from the parking garage on the bridge over Rämistrasse is expanded to the pedestrian and bike connection.According to people of the bicycles, this opens up a new connection between Seefeld and Hirschengraben, if only via the steep ramp along the Rämistrasse.The “balcony” should also be open to bicycles, with priority for pedestrians.
The VCS Zurich reacted immediately and delighted with a message under the title «goes!».The traffic club recently presented a similar idea, which also provided for the lifting of the less attractive sidewalk along the retaining wall.The city council had realized that due to the large, gradual talent, only a bike path at the level of the street was attractive, he writes.
This has a good solution to close.However, the hurdles are considerable.Not even primarily because it is necessary to replace the mighty retaining wall about 1.2 meters.
In the lowest part of Rämistrasse, the space is not enough for the two wheel strips.Therefore, from the potato market to Bellevue, mixing traffic of tram and cars is planned, a "tricky affair", as people said, who still had to be looked at with the canton.The difficult to estimate total costs of around CHF 50 million are also enormous.
However, 15 to 20 million of them do not apply to the replacement of the tram tracks at this point, which is necessary by 2024 anyway.Conversely, this means that a final project must be available until then at the latest, because the Rämistrasse should only become a construction site once.With a decision of Wednesday, the city council requested a project loan of CHF 2.8 million for the project.
Menschenegger went into further priorities, with the implementation of which the civil engineering department will deal in 2018.This includes the bike station with around 1100 parking spaces for around CHF 34 million in the city tunnel under the main train station.The city wants to start building in autumn, but according to the people of people, a definitive answer from the canton is still missing.
Together with the underground bike station Europaplatz, this results in around 2700 parking spaces, which could be expanded to 4000 with further structural measures.At the Stadelhofen, the city is driving the planning of the new building of Calatrava.After the municipal council's decision, she tackled the planning of the bicycle for about 4 million francs.
Here as at the HB, above -ground parking spaces are preserved.The bike route around the lake should also go ahead.What is new is that an underground bike connection between Utoquai and Riviera is planned at the Bellevue at the abutment of the Quai bridge.
This is not a dream, assured people, but technically feasible.The solution will be clarified with the canton and will relieve the situation on the Bellevue.145 New construction site in total, according to the city engineer Vilmar Krähenbühl, the civil engineering office wants to tackle 145 new construction projects with a total volume of around CHF 220 million.This includes several track renovations and the renovation of gas pipes in the Niederdorf.
In Wehntalerstrasse, ÖV's nodes are to be preferred with its own bus tracks.In addition, clarifications are necessary whether the capacity for road traffic is restricted.Otherwise, according to the new road article in the cantonal constitution, replacement measures would be necessary.

Frustration over rental bikes in Paris / / The other Velib rental velos, which is otherwise popular in Paris, have been scarce since the beginning of the year.This is pleased with competitors from China.
But they fight with their own problems.Rudolf Balmer, Parisda's Parisian Rental Velib has been a success story for ten years.But now the regular customers are frustrated.
Thanks to a change of the provider company, the city authorities had promised them much lighter and partially equipped with electric motors and, with reference to better customer service, had already increased the subscription price from 29 to 37 euros per year.This inflation had already caused resentment among regular users, which include many students with modest budgets.Now some of them have burst from the collar because they in vain have been looking for their rental bike since the service provider was switched. 80 Instead of 600 parking places of the old clumsy gray velibs from JCDECAUX, and their docks have been removed.
The replacement of the 1200 Velib parking spaces from JCDECAUX is a long time coming.Instead of the 600 parking spaces from Smoovengo promised for the beginning of January, only 80 are available for the time being.The new, lighter bicycles are rare.
This is particularly embarrassing to the Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, who has given the new provider.The rental bikes have not only been an integral part of the red-green transport policy for ten years, but they have also become an attraction for tourists who explore the city on the Bicycle traces.Like the Velib customers, Hidalgo from the new provider also feels revealed with false promises.
This bicycle crisis in the restart should actually be a blessing for the competition.The rental bikes from new providers have been shaping the Paris cityscape for a few weeks.They are bright yellow, light green or no less striking in yellow and white.
Their design is particularly clearly visible so that the potential customers find these practical and clean vehicles easier for city traffic.In contrast to the well-known Velibs, which have long since found their place in the metropolis for ten years, the two-wheelers from Goobee.Bike, Ofo or O-Bike are not bound to fixed docks.You can find the users with an app via GPS and you can make you after use where you will be popular.
"Free Floating" is the name of this system that has already been proven in Asia.The startup company of OFO, founded by two Beijing students, is already active in around 200 cities and in 20 countries with its yellow bike.What is new in Paris shouldn't it work, which works in Hong Kong?
The greater freedom for users, however, has one or two hooks.Because the discipline of the Paris customers can apparently not be compared to that in major Asian cities.Vandalism and theft could quickly turn the hopes of the new providers into a nightmare in France.
The city authorities are angry because some ruthlessly leave their rental bike in the middle of the sidewalk, in front of a house entrance or in a green area.Other disrespectful users seem to make a sport out of it, dismantle the castles or the GPS location or even damage the wheels.For these reasons, Goobee.bike has already announced the retreat from the market in Lille and Reims.
If the mentalities and the behavior of the French rental bike users do not change quickly, this could become a fiasco for the competition of the Velibs.The new Velib rental velos cause trouble for many city residents.Lionel Bonaventure /

A lot promised, little realized / / per bike looked at the city.The sobering result of the fact check: only 4 out of 26 measures to improve the bike paths were implemented.
Tina Fassbind Velof promotion is a much discussed topic in Zurich.The voters have spoken out several times for the expansion of the bike paths.
But what about Zurich's bike infrastructure?Bad !At least if you look at the balance of a fact check that the Pro Velo Zurich association recently presented:
Of 26 improvement measures, only 4 were realized within four years.The demands have been in the room for almost ten years.They go back to a motion that was submitted to the local council in 2009 - by today's city councilors Daniel Leupi (Greens) and André Odermatt (SP).
The two added the list of 26 streets in the city center to their initiative, where safe and continuous bike routes were to be built.In its response to the motion, the city council states in December 2013 that the improvements with two exceptions are already captured in the Velo master plan and in the city center traffic concept and that their implementation is therefore "top priority".Building projects would already be developed for many sections or would be before realizing.
Most projects were completed before 2020, promised the city council.In order to prove the progress, he performed the planned changes and the realization period for each measure.This list compared per bike compared the current state at the end of January 2018.
Four projects have now been implemented.However, only two of them have brought improvements for the association: the new bike connection on the Central and the Veloweg in Seilergraben.He considers three other measures as a positive change: the introduction of Tempo 30 on Löwenstrasse, the coloring of the Veloweg on Leonhardstrasse and the new bike strip on the Bellevue.
On Leonhardstrasse, however, the Veloweg is only drawn uphill, and on Löwenstrasse the input and parking cars are still the main problem for cyclists. "Headily useful plans" make up for four projects on the Kasernenstrasse at the HB and on the lake shore
.Most of the other projects would not even have any specific plans, and the four measures now realized were not implemented within the announced period."With a strategic focus of the city council, you should be able to expect more commitment," says Dave Durner from Pro Velo.
Confronted with the allegations, FDP City Councilor, Filippo Menschenegger, Head of Civil engineering and disposal department (TED), replies that in many cases the implementation period of the projects "has moved significantly back".Specifically, he calls the measures presented by the TED on the home square, on Rämistrasse and part of the sea route.These were torpedoed by the bike bby itself, supported by red-green.
"Since the implementation of road construction projects depends on a variety of factors, the civil engineering office works with realization periods instead of concrete data," he says.For Dave Durner, these are at the time: “If a period of time is announced in which a project is to be implemented, you awaken expectations.If these are not fulfilled, the cyclists are disappointed. »Planning stand Zürcher Velowege in January 20181 Löwenstrasse2 Central3 Leonhardstrasse 4

Velo offensive in oncoming traffic / / city of Bern
The city council treats the introduction of Velogegenverkehr on Schwarztorstrasse today.In addition to a new west connection, more security promises to be done in the existing direction of travel.Four letters are sufficient so that the same theater is performed every few weeks in the Bernese city parliament: a fundamental debate on the subject of bike.
Because the city government and the red -green majority from Bern want to make a Velostadt, it is always important to discuss business and advances with reference to the two -wheeler.The city council should also have a detailed bike debate this evening.On the one hand, a loan of CHF 6.6 million is declared to introduce bike rod traffic on Schwarztorstrasse;
Most of the money, however, consume road and plant management, which are to be realized at the same time, as well as the adaptation and renewal of the light signal systems.The “Gehlstudie” to the other is two advances of the SP and the SVP, which (also with a view to bike transport) require an upgrading of the scene and the Zeughausgasse (SP)- or the abolition of today's bike rush in the Swissthe Bären- und Waisenhausplatz (SVP). The municipal council rejects the SVP prevail.Both axes are of great importance for bicycle traffic, he argues and refers to the Bicycle Transport structure plan and the study of the Danish Gehl Architects from last year.
The “Gehl Study”: she breathes a red-green spirit and encourages you to clear out the city center, to lift parking spaces and to increase the quality of stay for pedestrians.Your mention alone is likely to serve as a template today in order to break down the sometimes provocative demands of the study.The SP-Motions, on the other hand, recommend the municipal council to accept.
The upgrading of Zeughaus- and Schnittgasse is not only intended in the Gehl study, but also in the new “Traffic Concept for Current Center” developed with the business associations.The lane reductions is concerned with the introduction of Velogegenverkehr on the entire Schwarztorstrasse, Michael Sutter, SP City Councilor and President of Pro Velo Bern, is looking forward to the early implementation of a long-term project."For the Marzili and Monbijou area, this is an important route to the west," says Sutter.
"Today, cyclists are forced to long detours over the Eigerplatz or the Hirschengraben." For Bern, it will be relatively new that Velos will be led in oncoming traffic.«That will surely need some getting used to on both sides.»
In order to defuse the situation, Sutter supports the proposal of the preparatory commission to introduce Tempo 30 on the last section of Schwarztorstrasse- between Belp and Sulgeneckstrasse.Further up on the Schwarztorstrasse, between Brunnmattund Zieglerstrasse, Sutter with the new solution also hopes for an improved situation for cycling, since the two -lane car traffic will only be led in the future.

It will be a hot race / / with 30 stations and 350 bicycles and e-bikes “Züri Velo” takes up its business.It will soon decide which bike loan can stay in Zurich in the long term.
André Müllerpetrus and Filippo Leutenegger: So far they were not the best friends.The beautiful parasols, which the Zurich civil engineering head had last summer on Sechseläutenplatz, were literally blown away by the wind, the situation was similar to its sun sails above the Münsterhof.
On the other hand, when the long-awaited launch of “Züri Velo”, the weather showed itself from the best side: The sun shone on the turbine square in Zurich-West, where the bike rental as part of the “Urban Bike Festival” (see addition)has been solemnly launched.From now on, Zurich women and tourists can trigger bicycles and e-bikes at fixed stations in Zurich via the PubliBike app-the operator of the Veloverleihs concession, which is concession.
The roll-out of the new system was blocked in the dishes for three years because the competition had contested the award to the Postbus subsidiary PubliBike.Two days ago, the Federal Supreme Court cleared the last hurdle out of the way, said people at the press conference.He speaks of a "milestone", eleven years after his current city council colleagues Daniel Leupi and André Odermatt got the project rolling with a motion.
Altstetten and sea basins “Züri Velo” starts with a good 30 stations and 350 two-wheelers, half of e-bikes and normal bicycles each.The costs are graded according to subscription: Anyone who pays CHF 400 annual fee can borrow bikes and e-bikes free of charge for 30 minutes each.
If you don't solve a subscription, you pay CHF 3 for a normal bike and CHF 4 for electrical support during the first half hour.At the moment, this is hardly necessary: the first stations are almost all in the flatter inner part of the city, between Enge and Escher-Wyss-Quartier, between Sihlfeld and City.
The ETH Hönggerberg and the university quarters are only connected north of the Limmat.According to people, 60 stations should be in operation in summer, especially old stages and sea pools will benefit.By summer 2019, all planned 150 stations are to be opened and the outdoor quarters are to be opened up.
2250 Velos will then entertain public in Zurich."The aim is for customers to find a station in walking distance, i.e. every 300 to 400 meters," says Beat Rohner, the managing director of Publibike.Companies can also join the system for their employees and set up a station, including Google, Swiss Re or Tamedia.
The small bikes of the “Züri Velos” take some getting used to at the beginning.The gear shift works perfectly, the e-bikes in turn have some train on it.Apart from that, the anthracite -colored companions do what you can expect from them:
You drive .The maintenance and repair of the bicycles is organized by the social companies of the city of Zurich, they will also move the two -wheelers between the stations if necessary.The struggle is open to the long start -up phase of “Züri Velo” has changed a lot on the Zurich rental bike market.
“Free Floating” rental company without fixed stations push into the Limmatstadt.It started with the inconspicuous, rather expensive e-bikes from Smide and the yellow-gray bicycles from O-Bike, which literally flooded the city in summer 2017.In December, the poison green bikes of the California competitor Limebike joined.
According to the latest information, the fleet has now leveled off on 600 bikes at O-Bike, whereby new bicycles with three-speed circuit should be added from May or June.According to spokesman Roman Balzan, Limebike has now stationed 560 Velos in Zurich.Further innovations would be communicated in a few weeks, and the speaker cannot yet be elicited more precisely.
LimeBike had previously communicated that e-bikes could also be part of the Zurich offer in the future.Smide, which was sold to three employees by the furniture in January, maintains around 250 bikes.By the end of the year, around 300 bicycles of “Züri rolls”, the urban predecessor of “Züri Velo”, can still be found in the Zurich streets.
As if that weren't enough, a few weeks ago, the Carsharing pioneer Mobility announced that from April 200 electric scooters would like to have it circulated in the “Free Floating” system in Zurich.All operators put their cards on the table this spring.Traffic experts expect that some will not survive the hard competition in the Zurich streets - the decision as to who has gained the favor of bicycle drivers could already fall this summer.
A trade fair for "urban" bicycle team.· The launch of “Züri Velo” is also the starting signal for the third Urban Bike Festival in Zurich:
All weekends, the latest city bikes and racing bikes are exhibited at this bicycle on Turbinenplatz and shipbuilding.65 providers vie for the favor of visitors who can try out a selection of test bikes.Velol lovers can take part in various competitions and practice, for example, in the “Slow Race”.
The goal is to drive off a route as slowly as possible - certainly a pedagogically valuable test of patience for some Zurich Velorowdy.Furthermore, you can watch Danny Macaskill, an experienced bike crobat and mountain bike professional, which will show some of his tricks that have become famous over YouTube on two wheels.The “Urban Cyclocross” will take place on Saturday, a kind of cycling racing through the middle of the city.

The city of Bern wants to create thousands of bike parking spaces from Velos, heroes and old trees / / deep down in the new train station.That will be expensive .
Sometimes too expensive, even the city councilor, which has dealt with it.The bike and the city of Bern - that fits."Velos are fast, cheap, good for the environment, keep it healthy and stand for an urban lifestyle," the municipal council flooded in 2015 when he heralded the bike offensive.
His goal: make Bern a bike capital - no more and nothing less.The announcement followed.The Velohaupstroute Wankdorf: in operation.
The Route Köniz: Currently under construction.The project of a bicycle bridge between Breitenrain and Länggasse that has been shot from many sides: is still being realized.Sometime .
Somehow .In order to become a Velo head, it is not enough to get from A to B quickly and safely.At B, the bike must also be able to be parked.
And here the offensive stalls.Of the desired 10,000 parking spaces in Bern, there are almost 7000. The municipal council is certain:
This order of magnitude is only possible with new underground bike stations.And since the train station will be expanded as part of the future Bern 2025 Bahnhof project and receives new underground entrances, it wants to plan the bike stations in the construction work.Is called :
In the future, thousands of bicycles could park under the Bubenbergplatz, in the underpass to the Hirschengraben and at the output of Länggasse.The municipal council has applied for a total of CHF 6.3 million in the city council for the project planning of the new stations.According to financial agreements, the federal government and the canton would cover more than half of the costs of the new bike stations.
Is the Bernese parking problem soon history?Not quite .Because there is still the problem with the story, more precisely: with cultural treasures - and with old trees.
If there is anything at all that bicycles can slow down in Bern, they are.Both could be doomed to the station under the Hirschengraben.According to the feasibility study, over 2500 parking spaces would be conceivable.
But it would need stairs and ramps for this - and they are "assessed negatively from a city -wide and monument conservation perspective," the municipal council wrote in its lecture on the parking space offer.Is Adrian von Bubenberg's statue completely banished by the Hirschengraben?The bronze hero pushed back by Velos after the real one successfully offered the Burgundians in Murten?
Hardly conceivable.In addition, the “mostly healthy and sometimes very old” chestnut trees in the Hirschengraben would have to be removed, the municipal council continues.Become a gap fungus of the red-green bike in costume?
Time will tell .At the next city council meeting, the Commission for Planning, Transport and Stadtgrün (PVS) will apply to reduce the project planning loan from CHF 3 million to CHF 870,000.The bike station under Bubenbergplatz is even more difficult.
1000 parking spaces would be feasible here.Theoretically.On the one hand, the PVS fears that they could not be realized “due to archaeological treasures in the underground”.
On the other hand, the system would cost a total of CHF 19.25 million due to the difficult construction work - i.e. CHF 19 250 per bike parking space.This even seemed disproportionately expensive for the members of the PVS-although red-green also has the majority in this commission.It therefore requests that the projecting loan over CHF 2,150,000 entirely delete.
Commission President Michael Sutter (SP) says that there are rarely among the members.“In this case, we largely agreed that it is not worth pursuing the project.“This punishes the Commission those

Velospot builds out / / / region of Thun
As part of the flanking measures during the construction site phase in Thun, the network of the Veloverleih Velospot is expanded to include eight stations in Steffisburg and Hilterfingen. "The automatic bicycle loan system Velospot in Thun is becoming increasingly popular," write the municipal administrations of Thun, Steffisburg and Hilterfingen in their commonYesterday's media release.25,000 trips were made last year.
While the rental stations have so far been found exclusively on Thuner Boden, since yesterday and September 2018 - for the time being, Velos can also be borrowed from four stations in Steffisburg and Hilterfingen (see Graphics). «Construction site subscription» for half a year.On the one hand, new Velospot stations are a flanking measure to relieve traffic during the construction site phase around Thun city center.On the other hand, it is a test phase for Steffisburg to clarify whether the stations will be offered permanently in the future.From now on, 40 Velos are more available at 8 additional stations for automatic self -confidence.
At the same time, a special subscription is introduced with the “construction site subscription” that is available during the construction site phase and is valid for 6 months.The “construction site subscription” costs CHF 45 and can be obtained from various sales outlets or online.The automatic bicycle loan system Velospot has been in Thun since 2014.
It was put into operation as one of the first in Switzerland.With a chip card, a total of 175 bicycles (previously 135) can be borrowed from new 33 (previously 25) locations and returned to any other station.The card is available as a annual subscription, as a day ticket and now also as a half -year subscription.
The first hour of each trip is free, after that 2 francs per open hour.The Velospot system is operated and entertained on behalf of the city of Thun from the Swiss Workers' Aid Work (Sah) Bern.This is what Bern offers work integration offices for long -term unemployed, among other things, enables people to return to their professional life.

Little hurray on every bike driver / / city of Bern
Every bike counts: since yesterday, three counting stations have been delivering data on the bike volume for everyone.This has increased by 35 percent in Bern in the past three years.
The fact that Ursula Wyss has to climb on a media appointment on the bike has not been unusual since the launch of the bike offensive four years ago.Accordingly, the traffic director routinely swung on the bike at the Point de Presse yesterday.In bright pink dress and helmet, she cycled over Bubenbergplatz, much to the delight of the press photographers.
The reason for the small exit of the SP councilor was the inauguration of a bicycle barometer this time.This has been part of every passing bike since yesterday.The current day and year stand appears visible on a digital scoreboard for everyone.
In addition to that on Bubenbergplatz there are two other bicycle barometers in the Monbijou and the Nordring."We want to show the cyclists appreciation," Ursula Wyss explained the installations. "Incredible increase" every bike counts!This has been more than ever in Bern since the call to the bike offensive.
The goal is ambitious: by 2030, the proportion of bicycle traffic in the federal capital should be 20 percent.That would be a doubling compared to 2010.
At the same time for the inauguration of the bike barometer, the city also presented concrete figures for the first time yesterday.These are based on the 14 automatic bike counting points that have been available in Bern since 2014.The results show that urban bicycle traffic has increased by 35 percent in the past three years.
An “incredible increase” is that, re -floated Ursula Wyss in front of the media representatives.This shows that the city of Bern is correct with its forward strategy.More bicycles to make less cars to make their visible enthusiasm understandable, the SP magistrate from the rich figure foundus filtered out the absolute peak value.
8828 this is.So many bikes passed the counting point on the busy Monbijoustrasse on August 29, 2017.Ursula Wyss thinks “insanely impressive”.
Incidentally, the lowest point of the last year is 592, it was measured on the Weissensteinstrasse.If you assume an average daily value, the number of bicycle travelers on Monbijoustrasse has increased from 3060 to 4086 in the past three years.In view of these positive figures, Ursula Wyss is confident that the city will reach the ambitious long -distance goal of doubling bike transport by 2030.
However, a detailed evaluation of the proportion of total traffic is only planned for next year.Traffic planner Karl Vogel said that in parallel to the bicycle upturn, motorized private transport had decreased by around 10 percent in the same period - measured by the 28 car counting points in the city.Panne at the inauguration "We are only at the beginning," warned Ursula Wyss.
The hard facts now presented are intended to further expand the Velohaup routes, "that skeptics repeatedly fall into the same beliefs".The numbers would finally speak a clear language.The scoreboard on Bubenbergplatz delivered little clear yesterday shortly after the opening.
Apparently something had gone wrong with the reset to 0, so that the counting point did not work at the opening.How annoying.As if it had orchestrated the PR department, a cyclist drove past the counting point shortly afterwards, cheated the fist and cheered: «Hey, I'm the first!»

"We want a dense network quickly" / / city of Bern
Yesterday Bern inaugurated his new bike loan system.For the time being, 70 stations with 700 bicycles are in operation.For Ursula Wyss, June 28th is almost like a new holiday:
The SP councilor shone like a honey cake horse at the inauguration of the bike loan system.Since yesterday at 6 a.m., 70 stations with 350 normal bicycles and 350 e-bikes have been in operation."The first expansion to 1000 bicycles and 100 stations follow in September," says public manager Bruno Rohner.
Because a dense network is necessary for success.Bern is to be equipped across the board, so that there is a maximum of 400 meters between the stations.Bern is not the first city in which public bicycles delivers.
"But at the same time we provide 70 stations, that's twice as many as in Zurich," said Rohner.This step is mastered, now you have to get the project rolling.For this, PubliBike employees will be on site for this at the Zeughausgasse and Heiliggeistkirche.
In addition, there are various subscriptions, payment options and registration methods that have explanatory need (see box). Kleine wheels, thick pneus with the largest bicycle loan system in Switzerland hopes to be able to drive forward traffic director Ursula Wyss, Bern as a bicycle city."In the case of four years, bike traffic has increased by 35 percent, as much as in no other Swiss city," she explains proudly.
Unlike in some city abroad, they are not in a docking station, but loosely on the parking spaces.These are recognizable to high or landscape signal boards.There are more subtle plates for the old town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the parking spaces are minimally marked. "Important bicycles are also important for success," says Bruno Rohner.
First test drives show: Small wheels for quick acceleration.Thick tires so that you cannot get into the tram tracks.Easily adjustable saddle.
Stepless hub gear.Despite the complex castle, it is not chunky.This quality is also reflected in the production price: CHF 2,000 for an e-bike, CHF 1400 for a conventional one.
Further tests have childhood diseases.For example, a bike appears in the app as twice.A call to the hotline could clarify this.
This could happen that you have to check the bill, it said.During the first trip, irritated that the basket on the handlebar did not thwart.The regular user gets used to this.
Around 30 people work thanks to Velos in the Postbus subsidiary PubliBike, which is based in Freiburg.The hotline employees are not included.This service was outsourced.
Jobs also create jobs through Velo Bern: The competence center work is entrusted with repairs and maintenance: 20 people work in a reintegration measure for Velo Bern.450 job percentages are responsible for their care, 250 percent are driving staff.
One task is, for example, to exchange batteries of the e-bikes.These are charged with green electricity.«We see which e-bikes a new battery need in the system.
We know exactly how many kilometers were driven or what the battery level is », said Rohner.The normal bikes have a battery in the smartlock, which is durable and is only exchanged every six months.Doubled in the spring of the Frühling City Council, a loan of CHF 2 million spoke for the bicycle loan system for five years.
According to Ursula Wyss, the stations are primarily made available for which building applications had to be submitted.The city also supports PubliBike so that the system arrives well.Originally, Velo Bern should have started earlier.
The urban decision to award the order to public was challenged by the inferior Intermobility SA.The complaint was rejected by the Federal Supreme Court in April.The second expansion will take place in spring 2019, and the fleet is to grow from 1000 to 2400 bicycles.
"We quickly need a dense network," says Rohner.Claudia Salzmannin Video can be found on our website.

Locations of the stations can be searched for in the app, and the number of wire trees available is displayed in real time.To lock up a bike, select a serial number in the app, press the button on the smartlock and put the smartphone on the right.This does not always work right away, for a new attempt to repeat the step in the app.
Anyone who has an Srid card-for example a Swiss Pass-press on the unlocked button on the desired wheel and place the card on the right until the lock is unlocked.Attention: The first time you start to start with something.There are five different subscriptions:
If you want to borrow a bike spontaneously, Quickbike is intended.The first 30 minutes cost CHF 3, each further minute 5 raps.You get an e-bike for CHF 4.50 for 30 minutes, every further minute costs 10 centimes.
With Easybike you pay CHF 50 annually.For this there is free for the first 30 minutes with a bike, an e-bike for 30 minutes for CHF 3.50.At Maxibike you pay an annual fee of CHF 200, but the e-bike costs CHF 1.50 in the first 30 minutes, then 10 centimes.
With Freebike and the basic fee of CHF 400, the e-bike is free in the first 30 minutes, each additional minute costs 10 centimes.The prices of conventional bicycles remain like the easybike subscription.The subscription business bike is for companies that promote the mobility of their employees.

A Bible for Veloverkehr / / City of Bern
Councilor Ursula Wyss is striving to convert the city of Bern to the Velostadt.To do this, she had a manual drawn up.It is a kind of bible for bicycle traffic.
At one goal, municipal councilor Ursula Wyss (SP) stated: She wants to make the city of Bern attractive for cyclists from 8 to 80 years.To achieve this, countless smaller and larger measures are needed.
In the past few months, Wyss has had their traffic planners drawn up a manual that the local council passed this week.Yesterday it went into consultation.Velor routes and Veloststrasse Scripture shows the way to a future in which the cyclists literally and in a figurative sense can be used.
On the one hand, it contains a card in which the planned bike routes are entered.These are already largely known.Roughly speaking, the city distinguishes between bicycle routes along main traffic axes and bike breeds, which lead through little -used neighborhood streets.
Farewell to the dogmabe's latter, the red-green traffic policy says goodbye to a loved dogma.During many years, the advocates tried to calm on both sides of the street and offset parking spaces to reduce the speed of drivers.But this forces cyclists to corner.
This is no longer desirable on bike routes.Therefore, the parking spaces on these will only be marked on one side of the street on these.The goal in planning the bike routes is clear:
There should be a bike route between every quarters and the center, between neighboring quarters and between the city and the larger surrounding communities.So the one between Bern and Köniz is already under construction.The route between Bern and Ostermundigen, on the other hand, is only being planned.
A section of this route affects, for example, the storage mass, which carries out as a one -way in front of the program.The city wants to open it for bike ravish traffic this autumn, so that the bicycles can run smoothly between Kornhausplatz and the train station.The consequences for the other planning of a bike route also have an impact on all other road users.
This can be seen at the Guisanplatz.Here the city wants to introduce a ban on the left for the vehicles driving out of the city (we reported).However, the pilot test can now only be started at the beginning of 2019, as the urban traffic planner Karl Vogler says.
The plan of the bike routes also contains some future projects.For example, the much-discussed bike bridge between the Breitenrain and the Länggass district.The local council wants to develop the plans until the end of 2019.
Or in the Wankdorfquartier, the SBB intend to have an underpass for pedestrians and cyclists built between their headquarters and the Bern Wankdorf tram stop.Commandments for the Plannerda's manual also contains instructions for action - one could also speak of bids - for the planners.
For example, for planning an intersection, a tram stop, a roundabout or the distribution of the road width to the various road users.With regard to the road width, the planners outline the following wish: If the streets are poorly used, they consider mixing traffic of cars and bicycles as indicated.
In the event of medium -strong roads, the city plans to plan a bike strip in the future.And when the streets are busy, it strives to separate car and bike traffic.The city of Bern also wants to conceive the intersections.
So that bikers can turn left -free.In addition, bicycles are to be privileged at traffic lights.
So there is still a lot to do.The promised Veloland has not yet been reached.But the Veloprophine Ursula Wyss will lead the city miners there.

The federal government is committed to more bike funding / / The bicycle relieves the transport minister Strasse and public transport and is popular for sports and leisure.Security should also be increased with the counter-proposal to the withdrawn bike initiative.
For.Bern · In the federal documents for the vote of September 23, the direct counter-proposal to the Velo Initiative are mentioned as role models, Denmark and Germany.
Especially in their cities, the proportion of bicycle traffic is 30 percent or above.In Copenhagen with its well -developed Velonetz (including green waves for bike drivers), around 40 percent of commuters use the bike.In contrast, Switzerland is in the European midfield, with a share of 5 to 15 percent in urban areas.
The bike has its advocates in the communities and cantons, but at the federal level it is neglected.While hiking and walking in the federal constitution have their place, you are looking for a bicycle article in vain.This wanted to change the bike initiative launched in 2015.
However, because the referendum would have anchored an obligation to promote in the constitution, the Federal Council and the bourgeois majority of the parliament rejected it.On the other hand, one could agree on a counter -proposal that made it possible for the initiative committee to withdraw its initiative.At the same level as hiking in contrast to the initiative, the counter-proposal only contains a can-formulation to support velon nets.
With the inclusion in the constitution, bicycle paths will be treated legally equally as foot and hiking trails.Construction and maintenance of bike gegen remain the task of the cantons and communities, subsidiary supported by the federal government.The Parliament decides exactly what this will look like when implementing a statement in the event of a yes to the federal decision.
It can be assumed that the federal government would be given the same tasks as for the foot and hiking trails, the administration writes in the coordination documents.This includes the provision of data and statistics, standards for quality and security as well as geodata for maps.It could also be that the federal government, for example, supports separate bike tracks for fast driving due to the additional constitutional article.
In addition, the funds paid by the federal government in the agglomeration programs for bicycle traffic receive a waterproof legal basis.More security "is worth using the potential of bike better," said Transport Minister Doris Leuthard on Monday at the start of the media.A good bicycle path network contributes to relieving streets and trains and buses, where it is often tight at peak times, said Leuthard.
46 percent of car rides and 83 percent of tram and bus trips are shorter than five kilometers.These are distances that could be mastered well with the bike.A major factor that holds commuters from cycling is security.
While the number of injuries and deaths in road traffic, in relation to all participants, is declining, it increases during bicycle traffic.One of the causes is the upswing in the electrovelos.A good bike path network helps to avoid accidents, said Leuthard.
The federal government estimates the immediate financial consequences at around CHF 2 million annually.This effort is caught in the budget of the Federal Office for Streets.No new subsidies would be created, the documents say.

Bern's first bike offensive rolled 80 years ago / / slow traffic. The Bernese authorities boast to promote bike.
The city and canton of Bern are far from the bike density between 1920 and 1950.A bicycle festival like the “Hello Velo” tour taking place around Bern would not have been necessary in the 1930s to encourage Bernese to cycle.Between 1920 and 1950, every second and every second were traveling with the bike in everyday life.
The historical boom rolled up without any wheel strips or loan eastings."The bike was the first individual mass transport of history," says the Bernese historian Anna Bähler.Hardly cars were still running on the streets.
It was only when they became affordable that they displaced the bicycles from 1950.Despite the comeback of the bike from 1985, bicycle traffic can no longer be linked to the 1930s boom.According to the cantonal traffic microcrotensus 2000–2015, the number of bicycles was even slightly declining despite the emergence of the e-bikes-especially among those under 17.
Even the bicycles lit daily in the canton of Bern have not become longer since 2000.SVB page 6+7velostau

As well as without bike paths and public paths all struggled / / 100 years ago, a bicycle rolled in the city and canton of Bern, which puts today's bike in the shade.Before the cars became affordable, every second and every second drove to work with the bike.
Over far greater distances than today.From such a picture, the Civil engineering director and bike sponsor Ursula Wyss (SP) can only dream of such a picture: the cyclists are on the road on the Kornhausbrücke.
In three or four of them, they roll next to each other.It looks as if the long -drawn driver field of the Tour de Suisse would cross the bridge.But the snapshot of photographer Walter Nydegger does not show a bike race, but the normal Stadtberner rush hour in 1934. Jeder Bernese drove Velovon 1920 to 1950 there was a bicycle room that put the bike movement forced by the authorities today smoothly.
And this bicycle wave was still rolling up without wheel strips, bike path network or public locations.People also did not have to be animated on the bike with events like the “Hello Velo” tour “Hallo Velo” (see small box) for the second time.The Bernese historian Anna Bähler is a specialist in traffic history and, as a co-author of the city stories of Bern and Thun, dealt with bicycle traffic.
At her living room table she studies Walter Nydegger's photo of the Kornhausbrücke carefully.«You can see from the shadows of the bikers that it was recorded at noon.The employees from the city center go home to the outdoor quarters for lunch, »she explains.
At that time it looks like in Bern like today in cities in Asia, where droves drive to work with the bike and transport goods.In other Bernese photos of the 1930s you can see bike-driving craftsmen with a ladder on the shoulder.Or cycling suppliers with a braided basket. 35,000 bicycles were registered in the city of Bern in 1935, according to historian Bähler Bähler, cars were only counted in Bern.
By 1950, the number of bikes rose to a record 55,000.There was a bike on every third inhabitant, every second adult was on the road.Over much longer distances than today.
For the generation of today's grandparents, it was normal in youth to go on vacation with the 1-course bike through Switzerland and via Alpine passes.No competition by auto and the slow traffic of pedestrians and cyclists on the overall routes covered in the city of Bern is around 15 percent.In the 1930s it was 80 percent.
Why this value is so high in the photography of Walter Nydegger catches the eye: the bike dominated the road almost unrivaled from 1920 to 1950.The frequency of the trams was poor.
Cars were only on the road because they were unaffordable for normal citizens."The bike was the first individual mass transport of history," says Bähler.What triggered the bicycle at the time?
In any case, no planning activities or health campaigns by the authorities, the historian knows."There was not even an initiative for whom bike drivers are teasing the bumpy streets," says Anna Bähler.For the history of the city of Thun, which was soon published, she researched that most of Thun's streets had been grown until the 1920s.
The old town alleys were paved.In 1916 the road from Thun to Oberhofen was the first to asphalt in the canton of Bern.Anna Bähler briefly blinds back to bike history.
Around 1870, two-, three- or high-wheeled companions came up as a sports equipment.From 1890, air tires then replaced the former wood or full rubber tires, which increased driving comfort.Workers cycling for the factory instructions on a leap in the bike found Bähren in the newspapers at the time.
In the “Intelligence sheet for the City of Bern”, first complaints from pedestrians were published in 1895 about the harassment by cyclists."The employees of Thun's federal military companies also cycled on the sidewalk," says Bähler.The conflicts of use between pedestrians and cyclists today are already over 100 years old.
From 1900 bike accidents - for example as a result of free -handed driving - reported in the “Intelligenzblatt”.In 1900 the first city of Velo driving school promoted their services in the newspaper - with the picture of a lady in a long rock.On December 1912, 150 Velos passed the cytglogge according to the “Intelligenzblatt”.
In 1896 the city of Bern, in 1900, also issued the city of Thun a velor regulations with travel rules and an obligation to register the bike.According to Bähler, the actual boom used after the First World War.At that time, Velos cost 160 to 200 francs, which employees and workers could now afford.
A large part of the Stadtberner industrial workers cycled on the factories - and turned it off in the company's own bike racks."This mobilization drove up the area growth of the cities, thanks to the bike, work locations and workers' places of work on the periphery of the cities were able to continue to differ," explains the historian.Women in the saddle is of particular interest to women in women who were on the road up early.
In German newspapers at the turn of the century, she came across male misguided: women on the bike saddle were considered uncasceptive - or as too emancipated.However, this criticism could not stop the women.
"The bike was the vehicle, which for the first time also made women more mobile and more independent," says Bähler.The women drove in the skirt in the colder season with coat.Until the 1960s, a protective network on the women's bike prevented dresses in the spokes of the rear wheel.
The car displaced the bike end of the 1950s, the number of cyclists declined strikingly.According to historian Bähler, "an interaction of several reasons" is responsible for this: cars became affordable for normal earners.
In 1970 the number of motor vehicles in the city of Bern overtook the number of 40,000 bicycles at that time.In the canton of Bern, the cars caught up with the velos in 1970, from both means of transportation ran 300,000 in the Bern area. The vulnerable car traffic also made cycling on the streets dangerous.
There were no bike strips yet."And finally, the comfort of the prosperity also pushed the upswing of the cars," says Bähler.The oil crisis in the early 1970s then aroused an environmental awareness that also expressed itself in a new enthusiasm for bike.
From 1980 the number of registered bikes rose again.In the city of Bern, in which only 43 percent of households still have a car, there have been more bicycles than cars since 1985.As eager as 70 years ago, however, it is no longer cycled.

Optimistic number of bicycle use of the city of Bern are to be enjoyed with caution.Since the abolition of Velovignetten 2011, there has been no secure data.
The bike euphoria in and around Bern is great.In any case, with planners and authorities who were able to celebrate several top positions at the Prix of the bike cities this year.The Association Pro Velo was able to win the winner at the Burgdorf small towns for the third consecutive time.
Bern won bronze with the six large cities.The Stadtberner civil engineering director Ursula Wyss (SP) is a particularly eager support for bicycle traffic.By 2030, it plans to increase its share in the total municipal traffic to 20 percent, which has been the same as doubling since 2010.
In addition, an increase in the passing bicycles was measured by 35 percent within 3 years, cheered Wyss ’directorate in April.Despite e-bikes less bike, however, with good weather-tip values in highly frequented places.In general, the alleged bicycle can hardly be hardened with data.
"Because there have been no obligation to register Velos since 2012, reliable bike numbers are also missing," says historian Anna Bähler.The most recent serious value dates from 2011 when the last time the velovignettes were duty.216 683 Vignetten were sold in the canton of Bern at the time, explains Beat Keller, head of department at the Canton of Bern.
It can be assumed that this was roughly the number of bicycles that were really used regularly.The Slow Slow Traffic Slow Traffic Construction, Transport and Energy Directorate has counted velon use in the canton of Bern from 2000 to 2015 in its microcensus.The authors of the study immediately warn of inaccuracies because they are based on a survey at 4,400 households.
In 2016 there were around 850,000 bicycles in the canton of Bern - almost one pro inhabitant.There were around 100,000 e-bikes of them, and 30,000 of these were rapid e-bikes with heavy drive.However, the e-bike sales boom was unable to absorb the slight decline in bike numbers from 2000 to 2015:
From 2.03 bicycles per budget in 2005, the value dropped to 1.85 in 2015. Velost routes are not growing for the mobility in the Bern-Mittelland region in 2015 relativized the top values of the city of Bern with its traffic counts and surveys.Although only 43 percent of households have a car in the city, with 809 bicycles on 1000 inhabitants, it does not have the highest bicycle.
In the flat region of North between Zollikofen and Fraubrunnen, there are even 900 bicycles on 1000 inhabitants.The microcensus also shows that bike use in the Bern-Mittelland region has hardly increased.Since 2000, daily stages of an average of 1.3 kilometers have been covered with the bike.
Even active cyclists have not ran an average of almost 10 kilometers on average since 2000.While bike use in adults has increased slightly again since 2015, she stagnated with the under 17 years of age, from 2000 to 2010 she even decreased by the young people.For historian Anna Bähler there is at most one sales boom in sports bikes, racing bikes and e-bikes.
Young people can also be won for the bike again by styled bikes or bikes in the retrolook."But bike use has hardly changed in everyday life," Bähler believes.In order to increase bike use, incentives are still needed - especially safe and direct connections.

Switzerland will soon be more bike-friendly than Denmark / / The counter-proposal to the bike initiative, which the people voted on on September 23, is largely undisputed.The hot debates about the right measure of bike support take place in the cities.
Erich Aschwandenwenn you really want to make the representatives of the Swiss Velo lobby really rave, you just have to drop the keywords Copenhagen and Amsterdam.Many passionate bikers report with shining eyes as they cycled into the city center in the Danish capital.With melancholy, they remember their vacation in the Netherlands, where they always had a bike and could turn the drivers a long nose.
From such supposedly paradisiacal conditions as in the north, you are still far away in this country.Around 40 percent of commuters use the bike in Copenhagen.With a share of 5 to 15 percent in urban areas, however, Switzerland is only in the European midfield.
An important factor is the better infrastructure in the northern countries.On September 23, Switzerland should at least make a pedal reduction in the direction of greater promotion of bicycle traffic.No new subsidy vote comes on the voting Sunday.
These should be treated in the Federal Constitution equally as foot and hiking trails.The fact that Article 88 of the Federal Constitution should be supplemented is a sequence of the Velo initiative submitted in 2016.The referendum wanted to anchor an obligation to promote bike paths in the constitution.
This went too far to the Federal Council and the bourgeois majority of the parliament.After all, one could agree on a direct counter -proposal that made it possible for the initiative committee to withdraw its referendum.The counter-proposal only contains can formulation to support bike.
It is expressly stated that the jurisdiction of the cantons remains preserved.Cantons and communities are still responsible for planning, construction and maintaining the cycle path network.So there are no new subsidies from the federal government.
On the other hand, the federal government can set nationwide standards for cycle paths or provide geodata for bike cards and apps.The federal government estimates the costs of these measures to be around CHF 1.8 million annually.The opponents of the new federal decision, which primarily recruit themselves from the ranks of the SVP, are convinced that the counter -proposal also undermines the freedom and independence of the communities and cantons.
Only an SVP National Council, namely Thomas Müller from St. Gallen, approved the template.If the federal government is now being brought into play, it is foreseeable that high financial obligations will come up with it, the majority of his party colleagues find.Switzerland is already a Veloland, and to close the last gaps in the Veloweg network, no constitutional item is needed.
Against that is not too strong towards the closing ground.In August, according to the GFS trend, 64 percent of the respondents had accepted the template.However, only 38 percent of those surveyed have fixed voting intentions.
A fluid voting struggle also indicates that no counter -committee has so far been founded that fought the template.Improvement of the security to security.In addition, the front of the supporters is widely supported and includes, among other things, the TCS.
In their view, investments in slow traffic are sensible money for traffic safety.Safe and direct paths would most likely cause automobiles and users of public transport to use the bike to cover their daily way to work.Almost every second car ride and around 80 percent of all bus and tram trips are shorter than five kilometers.
The bicycle is ideal for this distance if the traffic was flained and cars, bicycles and pedestrians come into the enclosure.There is a need for adaptation and expansion, especially because many of them have not been designed for e-bikes that make it possible to overcome larger distances.The supporters hope for impulses for tourism.
Attractive routes for racing bikes, e-bikes and mountain bikes are already offensive today.Thanks to additional routes, this segment could continue to grow.The daily struggles between bike drivers, footmakers and automobileists for the scarce space in their respective “reveals” will continue.
But in one point, Switzerland will soon be at the top: the bike has not found the constitution in the Netherlands or in Denmark.The Federal Council's counter -proposal for the original initiative committee goes in the right direction.

2018 A wide alliance female for the bike article (SDA) · As a rule, the TCS and VCS do not have the hay on the same stage.With the bike article, they pull on the same knitting for once.
On Thursday, Thierry Burkart, Vice President of the Touring Club Switzerland (TCS), and Lisa Mazzone, Vice President of the Swiss Traffic Club (VCS), stepped together as part of a broad alliance.The National Council and Pro-Velo President Matthias Aebischer (Sp., Bern) sat between them.This organization had submitted the bike initiative, which was later withdrawn in favor of the counter -proposal.
Burkart is convinced that all road users benefit from the bike article.If slow traffic is privileged on side streets, the performance of the main axes can be increased.According to the BDP national councilor Rosmarie Quadranti (Zurich), traffic is also becoming safer.
Only with bike there have been more dead and injuries in recent years, she said.The security aspect alone is reason enough to say yes.In addition, cycling is healthy if the infrastructure is good.
For this reason, health organizations such as Diabetes Switzerland, the cancer league or public health Switzerland support the template.The hotel industry, the gastronomy, the tourism association and the mountain areas are also among the supporters.GLP President Jürg Großen (Bern) led the advantages for Swiss tourism.
Mountain biking gain in importance in view of the lack of snow.Finally, Mazzone, National Councilor of the Greens, represented the ecological aspect.Switzerland has committed to Paris' climate goals, said the Geneva.

Köniz builds the connection to the Velonetz / / Velo offensive by patchwork:
Köniz is convinced that the new Velohaup route along Schwarzenburgstrasse brings many advantages for two -wheeler traffic.Even if it is only built to a larger scale in three locations.The criticism was great when the Könizer municipal council brought his plans for the Velohauptroute along Schwarzenburgstrasse to parliament two years ago.
There was talk of a patchwork, yes, a handicraft.The Greens complained that the bike strips should not be painted on both sides and required improvements if necessary at the expense of the cars.The SVP argued that it was so little to get so much money couldn't be.
In the end, the parliament approved the 1.3 million template with a clear more.According to the motto "Better spotted in hand than the pigeon on the roof" - politics could be guided by the argument, only in this way the cyclists were more secure.In addition, it did not seem appropriate to spend more money because since the no to the tram has been completely open again how public transport in Schwarzenburgstrasse will run in the long term.
Today, two years later, there is hardly anything to be felt from skepticism.In any case, those who drive the project forward: he cannot understand the criticism at the time, says Daniel Matti, head of the traffic and maintenance department in Köniz."The cyclists will benefit from a consistently good connection and get ahead in the direction of the city." Especially since in the future it will continue from the municipal boundary in the same style: Last week the Bernese city council has 2 million francs for the sequel to EikerplatzAnd said to the Hirschengraben.
It will be realized from this autumn (see box). AB on the sidewalk.Work has been running here since March and they still last until October.Daniel Matti, together with local council Christian Burren and project manager Markus Mani, leads over the construction site.
The start is the roundabout on Brühlplatz, where the bike strip is missing in the city.Because there was no space in the existing road room and Köniz did not want to risk lengthy landing - but Daniel Matti puts into perspective: In this short, slightly sloping section, the cars are still slow and the bikers are already on the road quickly.
So there are hardly any conflicts from the outset.Halfway to the Bünenackerstrasse roundabout, it can be seen that the Velohaupstroute is not just about painting the most complete strip.
It is also being built - because suddenly the strip leads out of the city onto the previous sidewalk, so on its own route.The pedestrians have to switch to a new path that lies on the land of the municipal love park.The cyclists in the opposite direction benefit from the roundabout itself.
They are led on a separate track around the roundabout and around the traffic.The bypass is possible because there is no side street.And because the adjacent plot, which has to be nibbled a bit far, also belongs to the community.
At the height of the Hessstrasse and thus a roundabout, the construction machines continued to be efficient one last time.There is no bypass here.For this purpose, the center consists of a large elliptical concrete slab that brakes the cars.
Cutting the roundabout in more or less straight line, as has so far been made, is no longer possible.The local board of Bern appears more generous in the city of the city.Like the road, the bike strips are now becoming wider, instead of the previously minimal 1.25 to 1.50 meters, up to 1,80 meters.
These will later be a matter of course in the city, the authorities there have made the Könizer maximum size.As the standard, they even define 2.50 meters, but Daniel Matti remains calm: A city like Bern has completely different conditions from the outset than a suburb of such as Köniz.
Urban streets have ever been created more generously.With the CHF 1.3 million, Köniz not only improves the situation for cyclists.The pedestrians should also benefit.
Thanks to the new middle islands, you can cross the Schwarzenburgstrasse safer.There is also a new covering on a längren section.Stephan Künzidia
Velohauptrouteder bypass is only under construction: the bicycle drivers will come out of the city at the Bünenackerstrasse roundabout in the future.Photos: Beat Mathysnach The bike strip suddenly leads to the old sidewalk, the pedestrians give way to the park.
City of Bernwenn Köniz is finished, Bern only begins: With the 2 million francs just approved, wide stripes are painted on both sides at the continuation of the Velohaup route to the Hirschengraben.Among other things, tempo ducts and traffic light controls that prefer two -wheeler traffic are planned.
Work starts this autumn and takes about half a year.The cyclists will travel more safely from the coming spring.SKK

No more bicycles on the sidewalk / / mobility, an expert opinion presented by the city yesterday in Zurich says that Velos are inadmissible on sidewalks.

Switzerland is still not a Veloland / / editorial. Those who use one of the national bicycle routes, notes that the cycle path network gaps.
In order for Switzerland to become a Veloland, investments are needed.Markus Brotschider bike articles will not give cyclists in Switzerland overnight, as in Holland and Denmark.
For this, the new constitutional determination lacks the liability.But a yes to the bike article is the invitation to cantons and communities to invest more in cycle paths.There is a lot to improve.
A look at the accident statistics is sufficient: since 2000, the number of injuries or killed cyclists in Switzerland has increased by 27 percent, while the number of traffic victims has decreased by drivers by 34 percent.The climb is partly due to the boom of the e-bikes, which some make on two wheels.
But with an unbundling of traffic, with clearly separated and enough wide bike paths, cycling can become more secure for everyone.Auto and truck drivers also benefit from this because there are fewer conflicts and dangerous situations in everyday traffic.That is why the Touring Club Switzerland supports the bike article.
The bike is the most sensible, cheapest and most ecological means of transport in local transport.In Holland, a third of the population regularly runs bike, a quarter in Denmark.In Switzerland it is only 7 to 8 percent.
The e-bike has now also triggered a new boom in this country because the pedal support makes the changeover vonvier attractive to two bikes.But so that Switzerland can call itself Veloland, investments are needed.Dangerous lane change uses one of the national bicycle routes, realizes that the Swiss cycle path network is incomplete.
Again and again routes lead along busy streets.In urban areas, bike drivers are forced to change the lane, while on the left and right cars and trucks roar past them.It is not enough if a bicycle strip is marked on the turning lane with a yellow color, which drivers can ignore if necessary.
Bicycle drivers must be protected at neuralgic sites by their own light signal systems and structurally separated cycle paths, as has been the standard in Amsterdam or Copenhagen for decades.The objection is too often in Switzerland, and in tight city centers it is not possible to set up separate bike paths.That may be true in some cases.
But it is often an excuse because the will is missing.It is to be hoped that subsidiary federal competence triggers somewhat.The article on the foot and hiking trails, which has been in the constitution since 1979, serves as a model.
This is now being added to the bike.Switzerland is rightly boasting today of its hiking trail, which is 6000 kilometers long.If streets are always renovated or planned in the future, it should also be considered by the bicycle.
The right signal paving and right -wing politicians take the non -bindingness of the bike article as an opportunity to describe and reject it as useless.Some others warn that the can formulation is gradually being reinterpreted to the federal dictation.There is a concession to the rights and the federalists that the mandatory formulation of the bike initiative was replaced by a can formulation in the direct counter-proposal.
If there would be a no on September 23, the same politicians would interpret this as a signal, according to which the people would not want better bike paths.Only that's why it takes a yes.It is often not the missing space, but the lack of will that prevents the construction of safe bike paths.

The people can expect a better bike infrastructure / / The yes to the bike article is a sympathy for the bike.From the high level of consent, it can be derived that the population wishes to better bike.
It is open whether she receives this.Because the new constitutional provision does not make the federal and cantons of any specific requirements.Velo paths are now equivalent to the foot and hiking trails in the constitution.
At least that's an indirect obligation.The hikers have 60,000 kilometers of well -maintained paths in Switzerland.Switzerland is a hiking, but not yet a Veloland.
A lot has to get better for cyclists.Too often you have to be satisfied with a bike strip on busy streets.There are too many passages in the cities that expect the cyclists dangerous lane change or forcing them to share the road with the footmaster.
Ifever possible, cyclists should be able to move on separate paths or clearly separated traces.This increases security for all road users.The relocation of part of the commuter transport from the car to the bike also has an ecological and transport policy benefit.
Anyone who switches to the bike protects the environment, relieves clogged streets and overcrowded public transport.The cantons are interested in not resting on today's bicycle frastructure.However, it is clear that they will not decide millions to start a bike offensive.
In a few years, the authors of the bike initiative will ask whether it was right to withdraw their request in favor of a non -binding constitutional additive.In view of the high JA share, the people would probably have agreed to a bicycle mandatory for the federal and cantons.Markus Brotschi

Velo-Lobby Delayed promenade / / Daniel Fritzschees sounds like a red-green dream: In the middle of Zurich city center, a busy two-lane car route is to be transformed into a promenade.
A meeting zone is planned on Sihlstrasse, in front of the Vegi restaurant Hiltl.The project is old;The plans are well advanced.
Actually, the construction work should have started two years ago.The problem is the resistance that comes from an unfamiliar side: The city council's project does not fight the surrounding business - on the contrary.The city association explicitly supports it and hopes for better quality of stay.
No, the loudest criticism comes from the left-green side.The business is currently being negotiated in the responsible transport commission.One of the spokesmen is the green municipal council and VCS managing director Markus Knauss.
He considers the current plans to be "unsuitable", as he says.Above all, he criticizes the bike tour.The bicycles would be led by the Sihlstrasse traffic -free.
"There they meet a lot of pedestrians in the meeting zone," he says.«This is an impossible situation.»A quick, direct bike connection is needed on this central axis for traffic.
Knauss ’proposal: on the Uraniastrasse, which runs parallel to the Sihlstrasse, bicycle paths are to be created in both directions.
SP, Greens, GLP and AL expressed this requirement in the city parliament with a postulate a year ago.Knauss thinks to make space, one of the three planned car tracks could be canceled on Uraniastrasse.However, this in turn would inevitably lead to capacity reduction, which the canton would hardly accept.
This is how the municipal civil engineering office sees it.It still considers the claim to be unconceptible today - especially because the Uraniastrasse would be newly led to oncoming traffic with the existing planning.Knauss sees it differently:
You have to "think more large," he says.The car traffic can certainly be handled by another axis.He wishes that the civil engineering office is now making additional clarifications;
He accepts a delay "in the sense of a better solution".The responsible city council, the civil engineering head Richard Wolff (al.), Turns against the bike lobby for once."We do not achieve anything with maximum demands," he said on the sidelines of the annual media conference of the civil engineering office (see text below).
A good compromise that even the business supports is endangered.He continues to stand for the city council - without bicycle paths on Uraniastrasse on both sides.It has not yet been decided whether additional clarifications are necessary before the business comes to the local council or whether it is completely withdrawn.
For Andreas Egli, FDP council and member of the traffic commission, it is clear: «If we now sink the planned project, nothing will happen on Sihl and Uraniastrasse for many more years.»An attractive pedestrian zone will be prevented because of the constraint of red-green politicians."This cannot be in the interest of the population." A new place could be created here: Sihlstrasse and St. Annagasse, seen from the Hotel Glockenhof.

With separate bike routes, a lot of money can be saved / / traffic-free cycle paths have an outstanding cost-benefit balance.
Are bicycle paths just a desire to be left -wing - or maybe even traffic routes that pay off economically?The cantonal building directorate has created a cost-benefit analysis for a bicycle route through the Limmattal from Zurich via Schlieren to Dietikon.
With an unexpected result: Each franc invested in a bicycle route brings at least six times the use.In other words: a direct, obstacle-free bike connection from Zurich to Dietikon results in a positive cost-benefit record of CHF 160 to 900 million.This is reported by the latest Zurich environmental practice of the Zurich building directorate, which is led by SVP government councilor Markus Kägi.
Velosglenell routes are not racing tracks for e-bikes, but bundled cycle paths, on which bike travelers are also allowed to pedal comfortably.They are a kind of motorway for bicycles: consistently entitled to the way with their own route, and they allow crosses of two bicycles per direction of travel each.And the bicycle travelers are neither slowed down by sidewalk, sharp curves, cars in traffic jams or light signals.
The Limmattal is the ideal axis for a first bicycle route: flat, densely populated and heavily frequented by professional and training commuters.A government decision of 2016 states that the main connections with the greatest demand can be designed as bicycle routes if the feasibility and a sufficient cost-benefit ratio have been proven.
For the first time in Switzerland, the Cantonal Coordination Center Velo-Transport has now developed a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis.In the analysis, all costs were compared with the benefit in a viewing period of 40 years.
The costs for buildings, separate traces or longer commuter times were compared with the savings of public transport and road traffic, less air pollution, health benefit and lower accident costs.Various scenarios were checked in the analysis.The most negative assumes that, thanks to the fast routes, nobody will also switch to bike;
The most positive is from a bike content of 20 percent.Balance: Even under the most unfavorable assumptions, a new Veloschellroute Limmattal is “economically recommended”, not least because there is no low construction costs.Ruedi

Veloschell routes are economical / / Stefan Hotzder 2016 Revised bicycle schedule of the canton focuses on the everyday suitability of the connections.So far, leisure traffic was in the foreground and thus often cycle paths in rural, peripheral areas.
In the future, the strategic realignment should be promoted more in the future, also and especially in agglomeration up to a distance of 15 kilometers.The aim is to relieve the other modes of transport, i.e. to shift motorized and public transport to two -wheelers.An important instrument for this is the establishment of bicycle routes, as are known in Holland and Denmark.
These have a separate route, are entitled to the way and so wide that crossing two bicycles per direction of travel is possible.The canton is planning a first route in the Limmattal from Altstetten to Dietikon, another wants to realize the city of Winterthur.In any case, it is known in this country about the cost-benefit ratio of such an investment.
The Cantonal Coordination Center Velo-Transport in the economy directorate has now compared each other, based on standards for road traffic and due to analyzes abroad, for the first time in Switzerland using the example of the Limmattal Velo-Route Route.According to the study, the result is clear.
The VeloSchnell route definitely pays off.Even if no driver or public transport user switches, the expenses are worthwhile because the advantages due to bundling bicycle traffic such as time gain and less accidents fall more into the face.Depending on the scenario, the benefit is 6 to 27 times higher.
The advantage of flat terrainda's result was particularly favorable in the Limmattal case because the construction costs for this quick route will be comparatively low.Conversely, the vice versa has a positive effect that the route is flat and that the densely populated region has great potential for bicycle traffic.The coordination site mentions that cost-intensive extensions, such as under- or transfer to a traffic node, can affect economy, but still remains positive.

Breeding roads should definitely be introduced after a successful pilot test / / / City of Bern Since 2016 there have been two sections in Bern with the Beundenfeld- and Military Strasse in Breitenrain as well as the Erlach- and Freestestrasse in Länggasse, which work as a bicycle roadRoad users from the overcoming neighborhood roads.
According to a message from the management for civil engineering, traffic and city green (TVs), these sections offer quick and comfortable bike compounds away from main lines.And: The pilot tests in Bern, Lucerne, Basel, Zurich and St. Gallen have been successful, the TVS writes based on the final report of the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra), which has been available since the beginning of the year.The report shows a high level of acceptance of the bike breeds and a significant increase in bicycle traffic, which is above the overall city development.
Particularly gratifying from the city's point of view: According to the surveys, the attractiveness of the routes for bicycle traffic could be increased without the assessment by car driving and pedestrians significantly changing.Together with the other cities, Bern, in the consultation to change the traffic rules and signaling regulations, therefore require the inclusion of an article to signal bike roads.The cities have to go this path because, despite the positive results of the pilot tests, the Astra does not definitely want to introduce Veloststrasse for the time being.
According to the final report, the low number of cases and the short term of the experiments do not yet allow this.This is not surprising, the TVS states, since the pilot routes were only implemented with simple means.The pilot routes may remain in operation until the Astra's decision.

The BUND brakes the Veloststrasse offensive of the city of Zurich / / Daniel Fritzsche "attractive, safe, comfortable": The Zurich city administration is enthusiastic when it talks about so-called bike streets.Even as the “mosaic stone in bike funding”, she refers to those fast routes on which Velos have progressed and are supposed to move forward quickly.
From December 2016 to September 2017, together with the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra), she carried out a pilot test on two routes- on Scheuchzerstrasse in district 6 and on the Affoltern- and Zelglistrasse in district 11. "Not understandable" the tables on the roadsideAnd the markings on the ground have long been removed.Now the final report of the experiment is available.And the results that the Astra has put together read soberly: "Due to the results, no clear conclusion can be drawn to the practicality of bike roads," it says in summary towards the end of the approximately 200-page report.
Overall, neither a clear benefit nor negative effects of bike breeds were found.In addition to the city of Zurich, Basel, Bern, Lucerne and St. Gallen also participated in the pilot project.The Astra states that - if at all - the regime should only be applied on suitable routes.
A well -implemented Velostrasse is "not a cheap solution for bike support", it continues, but must be carefully planned and designed.The analysis is a damper for the cities who want to promote bicycle traffic with such quick routes.But they don't want to drop the idea.
In a statement, you point out that the number of cases was too small and that the duration of the experiment is too short to enable conclusive statements.The city of Zurich continues to consider the “bicycle roads, which are proven abroad” to be a practical addition to the existing traffic regime.“Velo cars”, as they are sometimes called, are known, for example from the Netherlands and Denmark. “Not understandable”, it is for the city of Zurich that the federal government will resist an introduction.
Specifically, she criticizes that bike breeds are not taken into account in the current revision of the traffic rules and signaling regulations.In the ongoing consultation, the cities are committed to a definitive admission.The pilot experiment also shows that a bike street can bring advantages:
So the comfort for cyclists has increased without the other road users "noticeable quality of quality".These findings are based on traffic measurements and surveys.However, the investigation also shows that the security sensation of drivers with the tested regime has decreased, for example, on Scheuchzerstrasse.
Dissatisfied spalls from the attitude from Bern shows itself per Velo Zurich."It is time for the Astra to wake up and take a policy that consistently promotes the bike," the association writes in a statement.The SP of the city of Zurich is also dissatisfied.
At the end of 2017, she submitted an initiative that provides for a real bike street offensive in the city.A network of car -free bike routes is to be created on a total of 50 kilometers.Despite the setback from Bern, the SP wants to stick to its initiative.

Where to go with the bike stations?/ / Traffic politicians are concerned about the safety of pedestrians.
It is a development that does not like the left-wing politicians in Zurich at all: The stations of the Velover loan system Züri-Velo have been spreading in the city for almost a year.That would not be a problem for three municipal councilors from SP, AL and Greens.
In their recently submitted initial, they first remove the positive of this innovation: «The bike loan system makes cycling even more attractive for a wide audience in the city of Zurich."This is followed by the criticism:" It is not important to play bike traffic against foot traffic and to operate the bike promotion at the expense of foot traffic. "Velo funding should reduce car and freest traffic, but do not create dangerous situations for pedestrians.Therefore, the local politicians ask the city council to check how the stations of the bike rental must be created so that they do not fall at the expense of the safety of foot traffic, i.e. without mixing traffic areas and without access via the sidewalk.
At the sidewalk driving time, bike stations on the sidewalk would stand in the way and “prevent crossing,” the municipal councils criticize.This is the case, for example, in front of the ETH main building on the way to the tram.Furthermore, the stations can only be reached via the sidewalk.
This is forcing the cyclists to drive on the sidewalk, which should actually be reserved for the footballers.«This leads to a endangerment of foot traffic and further conflicts between foot and bike transport.»The stations are also a danger for blind and visually impaired people because they are not marked with special markings.
The public also drive the rights.The SVP submitted a postulate last November.Your demand for the city council: no more new stations in existing parking spaces.
The SVP accepted the topic after it became known that the city had installed some stations at the expense of blue-zone parking spaces.(SIP) SIP /

The decentralized Velo show / / Velofrühling A new event combines 22 specialist dealers and presents the “1st Bernese Velonacht”. Consideration:
The bike offensive seems to be contagious.On the one hand, expression is the increasing values at the traffic mix that the city presented this week (and the potential that is granted to the two -wheeler by the population).On the other hand, an occasion that will be carried out for the first time today and tomorrow: The “Bernese Velofrühling”.
They present the latest models of their over 65 brands, offer test drives and in most cases also food.At the largest player - Thömus Manufaktur in Thörishaus - developers and designers refer to three guided tours (registration required). Part of the large four have launched the Bern communication agency project forum and the district period, which is already organizing the car -free Sunday in the city of Bern, supported byPro Velo, Velafrica and Bern Welcome."The occasion should be a platform in which individuals and small specialty shops can also contribute," says project forum manager Christoph Musy, who is pleased that "the dealers are now also more active in bike funding".Velofrühling »According to Musy, help to build an actual bike culture in Bern.
Those involved, who put a lot of passion and volunteer work into the first edition, would like to establish the occasion as one of four fixed "big" appointments in the Bernese bike year-in addition to the "Hello Velo" circuit, the car-free Sunday and the cycling event in Weyerlithat was held for the first time last year as a World Cup race.Luminating in the “Velofrühling” discoder is more than a dealer show that, according to the organizers, should always remain decentralized, preferably supplemented by many other dealers.Today a Velo-Speeddating takes place in the old fire department Viktoria, in several places you can bike styles for the "shining exit", which starts at 7 p.m. in the Breitenrain and leads to the three-man restaurant of the integration project bike in Liebefeld.

Separate cars and bicycles-but correct / / Daniel Fritzschesit almost 30 years ruled in the city of Zurich Red-Green.
And yet the left parties sometimes behave as if they were in the fundamental opposition.The latest example: The Velorouute initiative, behind the SP, Greens, AL and GLP.The central demand: Within ten years, 50 kilometers of streets are to be converted into car -free bicycle routes - "so that Zurich finally becomes a real bike city".
The parties also have pretty precise ideas about how they want to put their idea into practice: cars should no longer have to be found on neighborhood connections such as the north, customs or the fire engines, but also on more central axes such as the Stamfenbachstrassewould only be allowed to bear.The initiators explicitly mention the option of not only becoming active on the municipal road network, but also on cantonal roads, provided that this is "meaningful and possible".
With their radical initiative, the left -wing parties once again go on a confrontation course with the canton - and with their own city councils, especially the civil engineering head Richard Wolff (al.) And the security manager Karin Rykart (Gp.).These are now in a tricky location.They also know that they cannot walk around as desired in the finely balanced street system.
Unlike in cities abroad, which the bike bobby like to use as role models, in Zurich there is a lack of space for generous solutions in many places that would do justice to all road users.The initiators cannot conclusively show how the situation would have to be solved in the city center and at central nodes.The crux in transport policy is in detail;
Even a tasty formulated maximum claim does not change this.The basic idea of separated bicycle routes is quite interesting and could actually bring added value in certain places.For example in the Seefeld.
There, the initiators propose a quick route on Mühlebachstrasse, a returned district road, which is little used by cars.In principle, the processed situation on the Bellerive route at the front of the lake could be explained.Left parties and residents are calling for a lane reduction and a speed reduction.
However, the canton recently clearly stated that it does not tolerate any restriction of performance on this nationally important traffic axis.He relies on the anti-traffic jam article, which received 60 percent of the vote on the urn a year and a half ago and was anchored in the Zurich constitution.So why not reserve the Mühlebachstrasse primarily for bike and the Bellerive route leaves the cars?
The red-green parties are closed to such a Solomonian solution.In your plan you also provide for additional bike compounds to be built on the Bellerive route.Such examples give the impression that the initiators primarily want to satisfy their voter clientele with their initiative - according to the motto "Everything for the bike".
And the next step in the escalation level has already been announced: With the Juso Initiative “Züri Autfrei”, all municipal roads are to be freed from motorized private transport.The Velorouute initiative has almost sensible against this demand.

The left dreams of Velo-Highways / / Daniel Fritzschefür Motorist is not a good pavement today.Now the dominant left -wing parties are starting a new blow against the four -wheel enemy image.
On a total distance of 50 kilometers, cars are supposed to disappear completely from the street.The SP, Greens, AL and GLP as well as the associations per bike and out traffic with an urban initiative require this.They have already collected the signatures for the referendum;
The city council is currently bordering over the template.Users of the radical initiative would be cyclists.They are likely to drive up and quickly drive forward on the freedom streets.
Tempo on the Bahnhofstrassun, the left parties have presented a plan which streets should be blocked for cars in the future.As SP city parliamentarian Simone Brander explained on Wednesday, the new bicycle routes should combine the whole city and all quarters as consistently as possible.This is the only way to expand today's “patchwork” into a safe and generous route network.
The Mühlebachstrasse in Seefeld, the Talacker and Obere Bahnhofstrasse in the city, the Scheuchzer- and Stommfenbachstrasse in the 6. Nebenenben 50 kilometers on fast routes have marked further routes on which today's bike infrastructure have marked the car-free Veloroute.be and must be expanded.The Bellerive or Langstrasse should be mentioned."With our proposal, Zurich would be on the best way to finally become a Velostadt," said Simone Brander.
The parties' plan must be understood as a basis for discussion."We want to show that the idea is not out of air, but is actually realizable," she said.With their project, the initiators primarily put pressure on the left-wing green city government.
Since the elections a year ago, the departments, which are responsible for traffic, have been firmly in a red-green hand."This will be the first correct exam for the newly composed city council," said SP President Marco Denoth.The parties see the civil engineering head Richard Wolff (al.).
His spokesman did not want to comment on the business on Wednesday;The initiative is currently being discussed in the city council, he said.The question of whether there is a counter -proposal at best has not yet been decided.
The left parties signaled that they were willing to drop the initiative in favor of a counter -proposal.However, this must be better than the original template.It is clear that the bike routes will still give a lot to talk.
Not everyone is convinced of their benefits.The Federal Office of Strasse (Astra) recently had pilot tests carried out in several Swiss cities - also in Zurich.The balance was sobering:
With the expressways, neither clear advantages nor disadvantages could be proven.The Astra stated that - if at all - the regime should only be applied on suitable routes.The Zurich cantonal government also has objections.
Veloststrasse, which the Zurich city parliament had already written in the regional structure plan at an earlier point in time.The case currently employs the federal court.A green building director?
Despite everything, the left parties in Zurich see themselves on the right track.GLP councilor Sven Sobernheim refers to the very high approval values that bicycles reached in the city.
The Federal decision Velo was recently supported by almost 80 percent of those entitled to vote.The cantonal council is also likely to grow less resistance in the past elections after the “green slide”.The highest of feelings would be an “ecological building director” for Sobernheim.
He speaks to the Green Martin Neukom, who was surprisingly elected to the government council a month ago.If he received the important management, this would "help the bike throughout the canton and especially in the city of Zurich".

In bumping, the e-bike all of all of them / / traffic test with what means of transport can you get through the city of Bern the fastest?
This newspaper tested it using the example of the Route Köniz -Bern.Markus EhingerMichael Bucherdie City of Bern describes himself as a bike capital.
But are you really fastest in Bern with the bike?An attempt should answer this question in a playful way - without wanting to derive traffic policy measures from it.The traffic test of this newspaper shows:
With the bike you actually get the fastest from A to B.The starting position: On a Monday morning, three cars, a bike, an e-bike and public transport compete against each other.No strangers were elected as the protagonists, but all people who deal with traffic politically or economically.
The starting shot takes place at 7.40 a.m. in Köniz at Blubackerplatz.The goal: the Barbière restaurant on Breitenrainplatz in Bern.The requirement: All participants of the test must adhere to the traffic rules and the speed limits.
Start-target victory for Stromernach The start of the start of the start of the start of the start.Michael Sutter, SP City Councilor and President of Pro Velo Bern, can thread himself in the morning rush hour.Before the Bernmobil bus on line 10 starts with GB City Councilor Katharina Gallizzi on board, FDP city councilor Oliver Berger can take the route by car.
Behind it starts the drivers Lars Guggisberg (SVP Grossrat and Vice President TCS Section Bern) and Neo-SVP city councilor Janosch Weyermann together with SVP parliamentary group leader Alexander Feuz as a passenger.Berger drives the route to the "Breitsch" through the city center via Bahnhofplatz, Guggisberg uses the motorway from Köniz to the newfeld exit, and the two SVP city councils drive over the Monbijoubrücke and the Burgernzielkreisel.After a record -breaking 9 minutes and 40 seconds, Thömu Binggeli is at its destination with his electricity.
As a Stromer founder, Binggeli was particularly motivated to prove the advantages of his bike.Almost 5 minutes later Michael Sutter arrives in the conventional sense on the Breitenrainplatz with his bike in the conventional sense, Binggeli is already in a coffee in the Barbière.Katharina Gallizzi forms the bottom of the test.
Thanks to a good connection at the train station, the ÖV user with the 10 bus and the Nüünitram is still relatively quick in 22 minutes.As an advantage, she removes that she was the only participant to use the time for personal completion.Heavenly parking space search for the planned reduction of a car trail on the Lorrainebrücke in favor of the cyclists is an issue after the test.
The different attitudes of car and bike travelers are exemplary here.While drivers Guggisberg fear more traffic jams during a reduction, bike drivers Sutter praises the measure.What strikes further: The time intervals of the various car routes are very short.
Due to the city center, the journey takes 18 minutes, via motorway for 20 minutes and via Monbijoubrücke 21 minutes and 50 seconds.The drivers agree: whether you are faster or slower depends on coincidences, for example on the number of red traffic lights or construction sites.
After their trips, the three drivers from the bourgeois camp are stated that the search for a parking space is a special annoyance in Bern.And indeed: if you had had to look for a free parking space at Breitenrainplatz, you would have ended up in the last rank at this traffic test.
The fastest way from the Blukeackerplatz to the Breitenrainplatzob you are faster or slower depends on coincidences, for example on the number of red traffic lights or construction sites.This is what the traffic testers say about their driving homas Binggelimichael Sutteroliver Bergerlars Guggisbergjanosch Weyermann and Alexander Feuzkatharina Gallizzerverkunst, planned routemite to the Stromer e-bike on the Velohaup route via Eigerplatz, Bubenbergplatz, Bahnhofplatz, Lorrainebrücke.

If you want to get to B in the city from A, the best way to drive with the bike or Stromer.You swing on the saddle at home, do something for your health, are neither stressed nor stopped by the traffic jam and wastes no space when looking for a parking space. "" There is a mess of foot goers, bicycles, trottinetts and public transport at Bubenbergplatz.Here you have to have your head.
Unfortunately, nothing has changed on the red wave over Bahnhofplatz.On the Lorrainebrücke I got into a 'Velostau'.Here it is positive that the bike strips will be widened soon and that a car track will be reduced. »« At
Various traffic lights are preferred to public transport and bicycles.Because certain streets are closed to cars, you cannot drive the direct path.It would be nice if car traffic can also roll smoothly, for example thanks to the green waves at the train station.
Depending on the destination, different means of transport make sense, a peaceful side and cooperation is important. "" Even if I was traveling for 2 minutes longer in this test than through the city center, the traffic on the highway runs more smoothly.The highway should also have this function.The test has shown that two traces on the Lorraine Bridge are very important.
In the case of a reduction on a trail, there will be even more traffic jams at the Henkerbrünnli - even at the expense of air quality. "Alexander Feuz:" If the underpass is lifted in front of the Monbijoubrücke and on the bridge Tempo 30, I fear that the travel time is much longerbecomes .If a craftsman wants to transport a refrigerator, for example, this is at the expense of the consumer."Janosch Weyermann:" Before a trip I consult the navigation system.
That didn't suggest this route in the test. "" There were few people on the bus and tram, accordingly I found the trips very relaxed.I could even do two calls on the way.Especially when it rains or you are traveling with children, the public transport is highly recommended.

New bottlenecks for cyclists / / slow traffic. Two renovated tram stops in Unterstrass have become a needle for two -wheelers.
Per bike fears that they become an accident focus.Liliane minor activity should be joy among the bike travelers.The connection has been for a few days
Schaffhauserplatz– Stampfenbachplatz in the city open again, and a wonderfully wide bicycle strip is now available on the converted section of the road.But as so often in Zurich, this strip is not continuous:
He only begins after the Kronenstrasse tram stop, and he disappears in front of the Beckenhof.The two stops, also converted and designed for the disabled, now present themselves as a veritable bike traps.The lane narrows there to a so-called CAP stop, the cyclists have to circles on a 90 centimeter narrow strip between the track and the curbs.
And this curb has it tough: at about 30 centimeters it is two to three times as high as usual sidewalks.A look at the accident map shows that such a stop can be a risk.
One of the most dangerous places for cyclists in Zurich is the car -free Limmatquai.According to unfalled experts, the reason for this is the tram stops.There, too, there are only 90 centimeters of space for two -wheelers between the rail and the excess perheel.
Different claims Dave Durner, managing director of the Pro Velo Zurich association, are therefore a nuisance.Of course, per bike is not against a disabled-friendly design of public transport stops, as is rightly prescribed by law.Only these demands would be difficult to get along with the bicycle promotion promised by the city.
Durner fears that the two stops could become a further focus of the accident, because the route between Schaffhauser and Stamfenbachplatz is a bicycle main traffic axis: "It is not suitable for inexperienced bike travelers." Patrick Eberlin, Head of Transport Technology at the advice center for accident prevention (BFU), confirmed: «KAP tram stops are proven to have a threat to bicycle travelers.“A driving error is sufficient, and you either hang up with the pedal or device with the bike in the rail.Randstones of a maximum of three to four centimeters in height are considered safe for the unfalled experts.
And to be able to move safely, bike needed a lane at least one and a half meters wide, says Eberlin: «90 centimeters are not bicycle.Especially not when you consider that for Velo's supporters with a width of up to one meter. »Patrick Eberlin also speaks of a certain conflict of goals between the different requirements.If you really want, there are sensible solutions in almost every situation:
"For example, you can move the bike route or lead the bike strip on the trottoir and around the waiting area at Kap stops." There are better solutions interestingly, the Stadtzürcher civil engineering and disposal department has published ideal models for stops on its website- and that for a chapterThe stop looks exactly as Eberlin recommends: The bicycles are led around the waiting area via the trottoir instead of between the curb and tram rails.Such stops actually exist in several places in the city, for example on Röslistrasse, not a hundred meters from the Kronenstrasse.
Sabina Mächler, media spokeswoman for the civil engineering office, rejected such a traffic management at Kronenstrasse and the Beckenhof.She admits that the new traffic routing is "not very comfortable" for bike.But a bike strip around the stop crosses the paths of pedestrians, and such mixed bicycle and footpaths no longer arrange the city.
At the Schaffhauser and Stampfenbachstrasse, the bicycles are relatively quick because of the gradient.Tram stops and bicycle paths are also getting in the way in other cities.For example, bicycles in Bern and Basel complain about too high edges and too narrow lanes.
The situation will be more tight in the near future because the federal government has also had to promote bike traffic since 2018, says BFU specialist Eberlin.It is all the more important that bike routes are carefully planned: «A bike main axis is like a highway.And so, as a full whole, you should also plan them.
Nobody builds narrows and interruptions on the highway. »Left the rail, on the right of the raid, the capstone: At the Beckenhof it has become tight for Velos.Photo: Dominique Meienberg

Velo turmoil without end / / traffic at a converted intersection on the Langstrasse have to use bicycles the pedestrian strip.
That is not forbidden, says the city.Liliane Minordie Langstrasse has been one of the largest sticking points in the Velonetz of the city of Zurich for years.
The planners have only been biting their teeth on the railway underpass for years.Now this important axis seems to be richer.In a place where the square is the smallest problem: at the converted intersection of warehouse / Langstrasse.
The conclusion of an evaluation that submitted the city a few days ago is “insufficient”.In fact, the bike tour is partly presented there as, well, a little confused.There is, for example, a traffic light specially mounted for bicycle drivers - who is waiting with their bike where it is intended according to the floor markings, but the traffic lights do not see.
Not yet, says the city, that is being adjusted. "Simply unusable" main trigger for criticism is the new bike transition via the Lagerstrasse.There are yellow shark teeth spins and a no-advance sign in Velohöhe, which is pinned on the sidewalk.Bloss: Anyone who tries to get across the street with the bike, where it apparently shows the signaling, is suddenly stopped by a traffic island in the middle of the road.
15 centimeters of curb, not built for driving.Before that, however, the transition still leads across the waiting room, which was created for those bicycles that want to turn left into the Langstrasse from the camp street.This traffic routing is "simply unusable", says Dave Durner, Managing Director of Pro Velo in the canton of Zurich.
This is evident from an inspection on site: cyclists are forced to use the pedestrian strip, otherwise they cannot get safely and quickly enough across the street.SP councilor Marco Denoth shares Durner's criticism.The entire intersection is "in detail down to detail".
What particularly annoys him: He made the civil engineering office aware of the plans a year ago that the bike crossing due to the traffic island and the left turn could not be useful.Unsuccessful.Even more: On the other side of the long-road underpass, the city is planning a similar traffic routing.
Civil engineering head Richard Wolff (Al) and the entire city council obviously lack the political will for good bike compounds.Passenger stripes?Yes .
The city defends the traffic routing.And stand up with surprising information.In fact, it is correct and also intended in such a way that bicycles use the pedestrian strip over the warehouse road.
"Driving the pedestrian strip is not forbidden," writes the traffic department for the "Tages-Anzeiger". Yes, that everything is not optimal for cyclists, but the best solution under the circumstances.A separate bike transition is unfortunately not feasible.Reason: At the traffic lights in question, the cars that turn right from Langstrasse into the warehouse road have green as the pedestrians.
Such a traffic regulation is allowed as long as it only affects cars and pedestrians - but not in combination with a bike.With separate green phases, however, the backlog on the long road would be too large.The question remains what the shark teeth are good for.
According to the city, they are only intended for those cyclists who want to reach the waiting room from the sidewalk.That will soon be illustrated with an arrow.However, it is clear today: conflicts with foot goers are inevitable.

Bicycles wish further improvements / / Worb SP and Greens invited to tour at neuralgic places for cyclists.The traffic renovation in Worb is completed with a festival in September.
Reason for the Velo Worb of the SP and Greens to invite the “Velotour de Worb”.Together with experts from Pro Velo Bern and the VCS as well as in the presence of Mayor Niklaus Gfeller (EVP) and two municipal councils, the members of the working group and interested five weak points in the planned traffic routing and discussed suggestionsTraffic concept.Only a few things are not yet satisfactorily solved, »said Roland von Arx from the working group.
As the first weak point, the confusing intersection Enggisteinstrasse / Eggasse / Schlossstalden was identified.A structural measure could help for a speed reduction.The entrances from Schulhausstrasse and Bühlweg were also identified as a problem area.
Pusks and bicycles were taken away, so that one has trouble getting over the street.The street crossing at Gasthaus Hirschen and at the Bollstrasse roundabout are also delicate.In addition, the planned 30s zone at the Vechigenstrasse entrance begins too late.
The bicycles regret that slow driving is so often negatively connoted and refer to the concept of Mobilité Douce in French -speaking Switzerland, which sounds much more positive.In this respect, the AG Velo Worb welcomes the planned speed limits in the center.Roland von Arx would like the slow traffic to be taken into account more when planning.

Yes to Velobahnen, no to «Züri Auto-Frei» / / Traffic The city council agrees with the Velorouute initiative and rejects the desire of the Juso.
This is requesting this with safe bicycles for Zurich with their popular initiative.The routes should generally be entitled to access and free from motorized individual transport.
The initiators hope that driving in the city will become more attractive - and safer.Now the demand for car -free bicycle lanes is given important support.The city council does not present a counter -proposal, but recommends approval.
The direction of the popular initiative is "sensible and targeted," he says.A challenge when setting up the bicycle routes is to make them compatible with the neighborhood and not to limit the interests of the population and foot traffic.The principle of coexistence of road users must be preserved as best as possible.
In addition to the required partial driving bans and the lifting of the legal advantage on individual road sections, the city council proposes further measures: Signalization of “bike streets”, which the federal government wants to allow in the future, speed 30 and the cancellation and transfer of parking spaces.In addition, light signals are to be controlled and the bike tour is better signaled. "Disprinted" No, the city council says, on the other hand, to the "Züri Autfrei" juso initiative, which wants to banish motorized private transport from the city.
Since it is an urban initiative, only traffic on municipal quarters would be affected, but where it hardly causes any problems, the city council explains its attitude.The initiative also includes the spectrum of measures for traffic calming and exclude suitable approaches.Unwanted traffic can not only be kept away from the quarters with driving bans, but also with structural measures and one -way signs.
In addition, the implementation of the initiative with driving bans on neighborhood roads would cause a "disproportionate effort" due to its very limited area of activity.Numerous exceptions would have to be approved, the control of which would be difficult in practice.And it would be to be expected with lengthy legal proceedings.
A legal dispute is still underway on the validity of the Juso initiative.Finally, the administrative court ruled that the initiative was valid.This decision has been moved to the Federal Supreme Court and is not yet final.

A bike on every corner- bike rental in Basel is to be expanded / / Mobility The construction and traffic department will check providers in autumn, which could provide 1,000 to 3000 rental bikes in the city in the future.
Martin Regensassie exist in Bern or Zurich.E-bikes or bicycles that commuters or tourists can climb at various locations in order to get from A to B.The Basel region has also known such a free floating offer with pick-e-bike since spring 2018.
Customers can borrow e-bikes at any point and park them again at a place of their choice.Now the construction and traffic department (BVD) is planning another offer.As can be seen from a paper available from the BAZ, the Office for Mobility Thinks about a bicycle loan system that is supposed to include between 1000 and 3000 bicycles.
In autumn, the BVD wants to make a tender to find a provider.As in other cities, 6 to 18 vehicles are to come to 1,000 inhabitants.On the one hand, the BVD wants to set up fixed stations with bicycles at various locations in the city, on the other hand, the offer should also include bicycles in the free floating system.
The bike system is said to be “low -threshold usable”.As can be seen from the position paper, the BVD thinks of lending at least 50 percent conventional bike.Over 20 percent of the rental bikes are said to be 25-class e-bikes.
Electrovelos with a pedal support of up to 25 kilometers per hour are allowed to drive customers from the age of 16 without a license and helmet.E-trottinette and e-scooter wants to exclude the BVD with this offer.For Stephan Brode, Chief Digital Officer at Baselland Transport AG, which offers Picke-Bike, it is clear: “Just as the claims in this paper are designed, only public life is eligible.»
PubliBike is a daughter of the post office and is already offering a bicycle loan system in eight different cities in Switzerland.According to a spokeswoman, public bikes on these networks provide around 4,000 bicycles.Publibike has been in the headlines again and again due to various problems in recent years.

Up to 3000 loan velos are to circulate / / / Velostadt the construction and traffic department intended to search for a distributor for conventional bicycles and e-bikes this year.
Politicians and an existing provider of rental bikes have criticized a position paper from the authorities.Martin Regensassseit Ten years is demanding SP Grand Councilor Jörg Vitelli in Basel-Stadt a public bicycle loan.
For various reasons, the responsible construction and traffic department has not yet installed such a system on a city floor.This should now change, as can be seen from a position paper from the Office for Mobility.1000 to 3000 rental bikes are required, which are to be distributed at various locations in the city.
On the one hand at fixed stations, on the other hand in the so-called free floating system, where customers can rent the bike in any place.The authorities have a mix between conventional bicycles and e-bikes.At least 50 percent of bicycles are to be moved with pure muscle strength, at least 20 percent should be a slow class e-bikes.
Such electrovelos with a pedal support of up to 25 kilometers per hour are allowed to drive people from the age of 16 without a license.There is no heligatory held.Just cut to public, like the position paper with the required number of normal bicycles and e-bikes, is currently tailored to the provider public.
This is the conclusion of FDP Vice President Daniel Seiler.The post -daughter PubliBike already operates large bicycle loan systems in eight cities in Switzerland.However, it is clear to the Liberal National Council candidate Seiler: «We already have a provider in the city with Pick-E-Bike from Baselland Transport AG.
It is absurd to make a tender in parallel and to look for a new solution.»Seiler pleads to leave the bike rental analogously to the rental of e-trottinettes private providers.Those responsible also received the position paper at pick e-bike.
According to Stephan Brode, Chief Digital Officer at Baselland Transport AG, there is no need for 3,000 rental bikes in the city.«When I want to put the Allmend in strong stress in the city, I cannot even imagine where you want to put them down.»From a brode point of view, it would need significantly fewer bicycles with a free floating system.
The number of 3000 is probably geared towards a purely stationary system.Agglo communities inlaid Brode advocates the system with a mix of fixed stations and free floating.
As a result, the number of bicycles required can be significantly reduced with the same effect.«This saves investment and operating costs and can have a positive effect on the rental price.»In addition, a free floating system can also be used across cantons.
This with regard to the local communities of the city, which are located in the Basel area and from which numerous customers could also come who want to borrow a bike and want to drive directly on their doorstep.Brode wants a tender that goes beyond the perimeter of Basel-Stadt."Mobility does not stop at the cantonal border." Brode has at least 50 percent of at least 50 percent of conventional bike in which customers have to step without support. "It is questionable whether this corresponds to a customer need where almost every inhabitant inBasel has at least one of its own.»
A modern e-bike with a pedal support of up to 25 kilometers per hour, on the other hand, is a real need these days.»It is clear to Brode: If the Office for Mobility is designing the tender according to the current position paper, then only the offer of the Post subsidiary PubliBike is possible.
Difficult business publicblibike has always been negative in the headlines in recent years.Competitors accused their market distortion because it is cross -subsidized by the post office.Neither public nor pick-e-bike are self-supporting.
Both are dependent on sponsors.As the former managing director of PubliBike said almost a year ago, sponsors need to make a profit with a bike loan in comparatively small Switzerland."Yes, according to the size of the network, contributions from the public sector in the respective cities are also necessary." The Financial contribution of possibly such support does not close the Basel-Stadt construction and traffic department.
"Depending on the incoming offers, the project manager Martin Dolleschel, who is responsible for the Mobility for the Bicycle, says.However, it is clear that the tender is still planned for this year.
A tender is not absolutely necessary for Jörg Vitelli."I said Mr. Dolleschel that you could develop pick-e-bike." Upon request, PubliBike means that you would look at the details and decide on participation as soon as the Office for Mobility made the tender.The PubliBike bike - here a bike station in Zurich - could take the race in Basel in a public tender.

Letters to the editor / / edition of August 15, 2019 "Up to 3000 rental velos should circulate"
What else does Basel want to do for the bike?What a great idea: even more bikes in the city.Velos, which are probably turned off wherever it just suits you, as is already the case with the e-trottinettes.
What else do you want to do in Basel for the bike?How about if bike had a yellow number such as the fast e-bikes and for the bike, for example, a tax would have to be paid for?Finally, cycle paths ET Cetera are also paid with our tax money.
Perhaps more bicycles will then drive on sidewalk and other places that are not approved for them.There are countless sensible bikers who adhere to rules and prove decency.Unfortunately, however, the number of ruthless increases.
Hansjörg Müller, Münchenstein too many bicycles do we not even beautify the cityscape enough bike that stand around in the city?Such a vehicle is almost every corner.
In addition, the many bicycles do not beautify the cityscape at all.It does not need more providers of rental bike.Urs Eble, Baselvelo in the free floating system does not work for
I have two sticking points when introducing the 3000 bicycles.Submission: A submission that only aims for one provider is not possible.I don't think I have to explain that in more detail.
Velo in the free floating system is not possible!If you see how irresponsible people deal with the trottinettes, they turn off in the middle of the sidewalk, in the bushes or somewhere: Please do not!It needs (unfortunately) structure.
Just when I see what kind of chaos around the SBB station, especially on the Gundeldinger side, then dread me when many more, many more rental bikes are parked somewhere.Apart from all this, I think about the local bike.Should you just rent bicycles instead of buying your own bike from the bike dealer?
Beatrice Isler, Basel edition of August 15, 2019 "The cherry has lost space in the shop" Niederstamm cherries are sweet and boring all year round with the locals do not surprise me in the least as a cherry lover: since then only cherries have been out of the large distributorsI would prefer to do without the purchase of low -stamped cultures.
With their boring sweetness in unit taste, they have nothing to do with the early sweet-acid, highly aromatic high-stemm cherries with their incomparable aroma.Also, it is certainly not due to the too little noticeable expenses in the shop if you like to use import stone fruit today - it tastes almost as boring, but it costs less than half.So instead of more marketing: Back to the irresistible high -stem cherries with their exclusive taste, which are then also worth their high price!
Unfortunately, I am forced today to stock up on the increasingly rare producers with high -stem cherries.These cherries are not only big and do not taste boring, but crisp -aromatic.Edith Ilg-Raible, Basel edition of August 15, 2019 "Mann be forbidden"

Velo project on Helvetiaplatz has ended due to complaints / / / City of Bern For two weeks, bike traffic on Helvetiaplatz has been led on the museum side by orange metal thresholds on the ground from the road away to the sidewalk.
With a sign of “pedestrian path / Velos”, foot accolants are signaled that they have to count on bicycles coming from the right.This new “Velobahn” is a pilot test, as the Stadtberner traffic planner Karl Vogel reports on request.
«The street area around the Helvetiaplatz is demanding in terms of traffic and leads to problems.That is why we tried to clarify with structural elements there, »says Vogel.Until the definitive redesign of the square, which is planned for 2023, one did not want to wait.
Only: For road users, the attempt with the orange barriers has not been well received, as the traffic planner confirms.«We received a lot of negative feedback.Of passers -by and bike drivers, but also from Bernmobil.
Even from the club Pro Velo came critical questions, »says Vogel.For this reason, the city will end the attempt.The orange elements would probably be dismantled next week.

Velorowdy traffic is a mythical creature, TA 11.10./ / Traffic planner should be cycling for almost 30 years for almost 30 years with the bike in the city of Zurich.
Unfortunately, there are still unteachable sidewalk drivers.These are to be "educated" by stingy buses.But I would like to say it clearly:
The traffic lights and traffic rules have actually been interpreted for drivers.They don't fit the cyclist.Example: If I come to the next traffic light after starting a green phase, it is already on red.
The cars have long been through.So wait again.That totally slows down.
So you see if possible and start.The bike is the means of transport that you want to get to the destination with quickly.There shouldn't be too much obstacles on the way.
Also a veloparking, e.g.B. 50 meters away, is already a "disruptive factor".I want to be on site quickly and don't have to go there on foot.The traffic planners should actually be cyclists.
Whose traffic designers are probably very different.Paul Kunz, Zurich not in local recreation area Velorowdys can also be found on hiking trails.The guys whiz by the hikers with silent and high pace and enjoy their joy when they can frighten people and animals.
The ringing is a foreign word for these people!As a hiker, you are powerless, because until you recovered from the fright and can complain, the cyclists have already disappeared.It is also only a matter of time on hiking trails until such a Velorowdy people or an animal.

Bike -friendly tracks for Basel / / Traffic
Together with BVB, Pro Velo and VCS, the canton tests a system to fill rail grooves with a rubber profile.In Füllinsdorf, bicycles are currently being sent to the tracks on the Ziegler site.The construction and traffic department (BVD) of the canton of Basel-Stadt tests a so-called bicycle-friendly track system here in cooperation with BVB, Pro Velo and the VCS of both Basel.
On Tuesday, media were invited to test it themselves.There are currently around 77 holding edges in Basel, i.e. zones at stops, where the tracks are built so close to the sidewalk that bicycles have little space to drive through between rails and curb, explains Adrienne Hungerbühler from the Basel-Stadt mobility planning.This situation will be tightened in the future - among other things, because stops are increasingly being converted in accordance with the Disabled Equality Act.
The BVD has decided to test a Dätwyler system system.It provides to fill the rail grooves at so -called chapter stops with a rubber profile.Bicycles are light enough to drive over it without sinking.
Trams would in turn impress the rubber through their weight when driving over.A kind of box in the track fixes the rubber so that it does not slip.During the test drive, this system proves to be suitable.
You feel safe as a cyclist.The view does not have to stand on the rails all the time to avoid falling.Braking is also successful.
What such tracks should cost is unclear."More than normal rails," reveals Hungerbühler.The approval for the system unique in Switzerland is still missing.
It is not until mid -2021 a test at the Bruderholz stop.Provided that the tracks survive the upcoming intensive tests.Because they have to prove that they survive heat, frost and Räppli rain.

Veloroute with oncoming traffic provides criticism / / Stad Bern on Schwarztorstrasse now cross bicycles and cars.
Michael Bucherpass crossers and cyclists crossing himself directly in Bern in Bern in more and more places.
This is also the case on Schwarztorstrasse.Between Sulgeneckstrasse and Loryplatz, where one -way traffic previously ruled, cyclists can now also drive west.This has the side effect that drivers can only drive in one track.
The newly introduced bike ranges causes criticism in terms of security.Because the Schwarztorstrasse is a main traffic axis, Lars Guggisberg finds the new traffic management problematic.He is President of the TCS section Bern.
"A large part of traffic safety is once more sacrificed on the altar of urban traffic ideology," he says.Michael Sutter, President of Pro Velo Bern, sees it less dramatic.He thinks you need mutual consideration and some time to get used to it.
But he also objects that a few structural adjustments would not hurt to better separate the bike path.The city of Bern defends the concept of Velogegenverkehr.However, the traffic directorate does not deny that the current situation on Schwarztorstrasse does not correspond to the ideal solution.
The 1.5 meter wide bicycle strips are actually too narrow.However, traffic planner Karl Vogel promises changes to partially remedy this shortcoming.In addition to a pilot project with separating elements, the introduction of km / h between 30 is planned, at least on the section between Belp and Sulgeneckstrasse.
So it was actually planned from the start.According to Vogel, however, the introduction is blocked by a complaint procedure.Page 6+7

Züri bike: End with free / / mobility "Sustainable mobility is not free," says the public CEO.So far, the city has not paid any contributions.
They can now be seen almost everywhere in Zurich, the anthracite-colored Züri bikes.Over 2000 of these bikes are available to the population at 150 stations in the urban area.A million trips have already been made with the loan system that is operated by Publibike AG, the city recently said.
Züri-Velo, which started in April 2018, is almost a bargain.The city of Zurich does not pay any contributions.But now the invoice for the PostBus subsidiary is no longer working.
In Bern, the zero tariff for the offer should therefore be over when the contract with public life expires, as the “Berner Zeitung” wrote yesterday.The same scenario is emerging in Zurich when the five -year contract with the city ends in 2023.A certain euphoria was offered in the beginning, says public CEO Markus Bacher on request.
«Sustainable mobility is not free.I can imagine that we will no longer offer the same contractual conditions and that we will negotiate the conditions. »It is still unclear whether the city of Zurich will extend the contract under changed conditions.«We are now observing how the system proves itself;
Therefore, forecasts, which will be in 2024, are premature, »says Evelyne Richiger, head of communication at the Zurich civil engineering office.Bacher himself does not yet have a plan B, should it not work after 2023 with the continuation of Züri-Velo."We are in dialogue with the city of Zurich and are convinced that we find a common solution." In
Zurich less useful comparison to Bern, where there are now 170 public stations, the offer in Zurich is used a little less intensely and, according to Bacher, is also a bit smaller.To do this, PubliBike in Bern has to look for a successor for the main sponsor Migros, who got out of the project at the beginning of the year.
In Zurich, on the other hand, one is “very happy” with the current sponsors ZKB and EWZ, but is always happy about new partners and sponsors, says Bacher.The public CEO is also proud of the various partnerships with companies in the Zurich region.«We feel a growing interest of companies in alternative mobility offers.»
Many would look for concepts to move their employees to avoid traveling in private cars.Bacher sees great potential for the subscription for corporate customers: a public subscription promotes sustainable employee mobility, is a good addition to public transport and helps to reduce private transport and reduce the number of parking spaces.
The introduction of a Veloverliehnet network in the city of Zurich goes back to a municipal council in 2007.The city wrote down the project seven years later, and Publibike AG was awarded the contract in February 2015.Due to a legal dispute over the award of the order, there were delays.
The civil engineering and disposal department was only able to issue the usage concession in June 2017 after a federal court decision.The first stations were installed in March 2018.Since the opening on April 6, 2018, the Züri bike network has been expanded to over 2000 bicycles today-around 1,000 of them are e-bikes.
The structure of the rental system for the city is thus fulfilled according to the contract.Tina Fassbind

As the judge came to a bike / / Velo industry and Corona The Bernese bike dealers are currently not allowed to sell in their shops.
But a judge knew how to help herself and her dealer.Esther Diener-Morschermerzeit is still getting used to: a bike driver puts her bike off her bike before shopping the bike dealer, takes a step back, then comes the bicycle, takes the bike and pushes it into the workshop.
Everything with the proper minimum distance of two meters.The bike dealers can keep their workshops open with official blessings."Workshops for means of transport remain open during the extraordinary situation," is the official instruction.
The Federal Council wants to ensure the mobility of the population.Faring is one of the few leisure activities that are still allowed outside of the house.In addition, the bike is an alternative to bus and tram.
So also for the judge who wanted to buy a bike from City Cycles in Bernese Breitenrain so that she is enough flexible for her piket service.He shouldn't sell anything, the owner Olivier Busato explained to her faithfully.But she assured him that telephone advice and home delivery were allowed.
Anyone who, if not a lawyer, knows better, said Busato - and delivered the ordered bike. 20 percent of new customers a bicycle sale is currently an exception for the bike dealers.«We measure the customers and adult every bike.We cannot do this by phone or online, »says Michel Bernhard, managing director of the bike cup shop.
In the Velocittà in Wyler, too, the sales business came to a standstill.For this, the mechanics could now fully devote themselves to the repairs and service because they don't have to be in the shop all the time.The same says Aldo Schaller from Radrennsport Schaller on Sittigenstrasse.
"We can screw on the bike more efficiently and more concentrated," he explains.This is also necessary, because almost all of the bike dealers surveyed have more than enough to do in the workshop.Customers must expect up to two weeks of waiting.
This is normal in spring.But Manuel Rauch from Disco Cycle in Hinterkappelen has about 20 percent new customers: those who - as he suspect - have remembered their old bike in the basement and now have it made because they no longer want to drive bus and tram because of the Coronavirus.
Like other traders, Manuel Rauch offers contactless operation: if possible outside and always with a minimum distance of two meters.«All work is done with disposable gloves.Handles and saddles are disinfected after every service, »he currently advertises.
Velocittà only accepts repairs by phone, WhatsApp or email.And relies on strict social distancing."We ask you to keep you up to a distance of one to two meters when bringing or picking up the bike," the business informs the customers.
The ski and velocenter also expressly warns when customers visit one of the four workshops in Niederwangen, Bern, Ittigen and Belp for repairs.Managing Director Patrik Straub also takes care of his customers: "Please make sure that you are planning your mountain bike or racing bike trips so that you do not accept any accident risks," he writes on the website.
No consultations are not the right time to search for "speed or thrill".Because for Patrik Straub it is clear: "The hospitals and emergency services must not be added to a stupid fall." Patrik Straub would like to keep bike sale despite the currently banned direct sale with an online shop.
But so far you have placed a lot of emphasis on personal advice and therefore did without this sales channel, he says.So he sends customers back home with customers who want to buy something."We strictly do without consultations in the shop," he assures.
But you have to be inventive.If you want a bike, you can get advice by phone and email.With the information on the leg length and the body size, the right bike can be selected, he explains.
Straub also makes the purchase completely contactless: «The customers transfer the purchase amount.Then we put the bike secured with a figure lock in the stand and share the number code from the customer.

Zurich had a new bicycle path-while 25 minutes / / environmental activist the bike is one of the winners of the Corona crisis.
You have to use that now.A few pylons and a little color - the bike path is ready.The environmental organization by traffic on Thursday morning wants to show that it could be so easy:
On a short section of Gessnerallee at the main train station, the activists equipped with protective masks and luminous vests block a car trail at 9:30 a.m.For around 25 minutes, car and truck drivers have to be satisfied with one way, on the other it is said: "Only for bicycles". The temporary "pop-up b-veloweg" states that the city of Zurich is now making forward and lanes for theVeloverkehr has to convert, says SP councilor Simone Brander, who is involved in the Zurich regional group of by traffic.Cities like Berlin, Milan or Bogotá had shown it.
Brander is also convinced in Zurich in Zurich.And now is the right moment for it.Because people have increasingly switched to bike during the Corona crisis.
This is not just the weather that was nice for a long time.On the past rainy days, the impression was confirmed that the bike in the city was one of the winners of the crisis.Now car traffic is increasing again due to the loosening of the Corona measures.
However, studies have shown that bad air leads to a significantly increased death rate for Corona infected, writes about the action in the media release.Therefore, car traffic as the main cause of bad air must be reduced.And bike transport is also superior to the public transport because the distance rule can be better observed.
In an open letter to security chief Karin Rykart (Greens), the Stadtzürcher SP provides similar demands to them as traffic: lanes or parking fields for bicycle traffic should be converted on a selection of local streets.For this purpose, the streets in which the implementation of the Velorouute initiative is intended are particularly suitable for this.
In addition, the city of Zurich had to put pressure on the canton that such measures can also be implemented on cantonal roads.And finally, the SP demands closed quarters on Sundays for cars.The criticism follows on the foot of the suggestions, FDP councilor Andreas Egli:
«This is the cheap attempt to use the Corona crisis for your own interests.»People are currently avoiding public transport - this applies not only to cyclists, but also for everyone who rely on the car.In bad weather, the bike continues to contribute little to the mobility mix.
"There is therefore neither the need nor a justification to block the street." The SP recently criticized Rykart because the city police had implemented the demo ban on May 1st- although the distance and hygiene rules were observed."Even today we stick to the rules," says Simone Brander during the campaign on Gessnerallee.While activists collect the pylons again, the city police also show presence.
The campaign was reported, says media spokesman Michael Walker.Because the participants had left the place after the corresponding request, they would not have to fear any consequences due to the ban on assembly.However, five people were checked, their personal details were taken up and demo material was secured.

Velo boom leads to bottlenecks / / because of Lockdown in China since Corona has been bicycle trend.
The great demand now brings retailers to their limits: many models are sold out, customers have to prepare for waiting times.Maren
Meyerdie Switzerland drives Velo.And since the outbreak of Corona pandemic, significantly more than usual.
Instead of exposing themselves in a tram, bus or train, even the old, dusty models are brought out of the basement, as the Velosuisse industry association recently stated.Velomechanics stated that the tire size was increasingly in demand."This indicates that older mountain bikes and everyday bikes are made again," writes Velosuisse.
If you don't have a bike yet or have been flirting with a new model for a long time, you now seem to buy.Velosuisse members have had increased demand for vehicles and spare parts since the end of February.The Lockdown also did not detract from the joy of cycling of the Swiss.
Almost all models sell out this for the industry gratifying news now gives bike dealers to their limits.Some customers have to prepare for long waiting times.It could become summer from the planned bike tour in spring.
At Siech Cycles, a provider of urban bikes from the canton of Solothurn, you work in full swing so that the bikes are available again from June."We have increased the demand significantly in the past few weeks and months," says Oliver Wyss from the bike dealer.This was particularly flooded with orders online.
"We have been sold out with practically all models for weeks and are currently receiving pre -orders for June." The reason for the bottleneck is called Corona: Asia and especially China are important for Siech cycles.One is heavily dependent on the suppliers on site, says Wyss.At the beginning of the year there were major delays from the Corona outbreak.
Only parts of a first delivery arrived in Switzerland.Closed works in China then led to delays of almost one and a half months. "However, we are lucky that the second delivery will still arrive in us in June and that we can serve the high demand," says Wyss.But: Due to the many pre -orders, a large part of this bikes is almost sold out again.
Many bike dealers are currently suffering from the dependence on the Asian region.Individual parts and entire bicycles are manufactured in China and other neighboring countries.Some Swiss dealers could have filled their camps before the Chinese works were shut down.
But even now that the production is running again, the capacities from pre-corona times would not be reached, says Dominique Metz, head of the supplier Veloplus.Because protective measures must also be used in Asia.Logistics are the online orders at the Veloplus attack on the Lockdown.
Accessories such as hoses, brake pads or tires were bought."People wanted to get their bicycles going again," says Metz.Since the opening on May 11, the demand in the branches has been extremely high.
"Within a week we had the best days in the entire company history," says the boss.Although he could not give any numbers, they are "unbelievable, every day is like a Saturday in the high season". But the customers have to be patient: suppliers, customer service, logistics and branch staff - all are at the attack.
«The market is drying out, the demand is greater than the offer.The manufacturers do everything to make goods available, »says Metz.In the branches and logistics, he had to hire temporary workers to support, more will follow in the coming week.
"It seems that we could make up for the losses that we have brought in during the eight weeks of Lockdown in the next two weeks," he says.In particular, the cheap models up to CHF 1500 are currently in demand.And are quickly sold out, says Metz.
Instead of the usual four, customers would now have to wait ten days for their bike.With the Migros daughters Bike World and Sportxx, demand across all categories is exceptionally high."In fact, the unexpected current situation is almost exhausted or emptied on the delivery side," says a Migros spokesman.
The availability of the bike at Sportxx and Bike World is currently well guaranteed with a few exceptions.Even with Coop Bau+Hobby, there are currently no delivery bottlenecks, as the retailer claims.But more bicycles have been sold here since the reopening.

Canton wants a “Velo-Highway” from Bern to Thun / / Exlusive Routes for bike drivers The path to the city should be shorter and, above all, safer for cyclists.
Anyone who drives the bike from Agglo into the city has to accept risks in many places.Fast overtaking cars, dangerous tram rails, tight road tours, delicate traffic transitions - security for cyclists leaves something to be desired in some sections of the route in the canton of Bern.Politicians have also been concerned with this problem for a long time.
The call for a better infrastructure for cyclists always finds comfortable majorities.For example, the Grand Council supported a preliminary kick by Bruno Vanoni (Greens / Zollikofen), which in 2018 called for a bike offensive for the canton of Bern.In the same year, the Swiss voting people also clearly accepted a counter-proposal from the initiative “to promote the bike, foot and hiking trails”.
However, comparatively few deeds have been followed so far.The implementation of individual infrastructure projects often runs in the canton of Bern - not least because of the scarce financial means.An exception is the city of Bern, where a lot has recently been invested in bicycle traffic.
Faster in the center, however, the cantonal building directorate also sets a sign that it wants to move forward in the bike infrastructure.In the newly revised “Sachplan Veloverkehr”, corridors are defined for the first time, where so -called priority routes are to be created.These quick tracks are explicitly intended for cyclists.
The paths should bring people faster and, above all, safer from Agglo to the city.Such “Velo Highways” should not only be created around the city of Bern.The centers of Biel, Langenthal, Lyss, Thun or Burgdorf are also to be better developed according to the cantonal planning for cyclists.
The plans for the Aaretal are particularly ambitious.A continuous track for bike drivers is to be created along the main traffic route between Bern and Thun.These routes are explicitly designed for everyday traffic and not to be confused with the existing leisure routes.
However, there is no specific schedule for the implementation of these plans.Not only should the lack of space be a problem in many places.Funding is also complicated because, in addition to the canton of Bern, the respective communities will also be in demand.
Accordingly, the construction directorate carefully formulates the goal when it writes in paper that priority routes are "checked" and "where possible" for the defined corridors.The Velo Boomtneben The priority routes are listed in the “Sachplan Veloverkehr” a further 183 sub -projects in the entire canton of Bern.
One half affects network gaps in everyday traffic, which are to be closed for cyclists.The other half are route optimizations for free time traffic.Among them are also extremely ambitious projects, such as a continuous tourism route of the Aare, in which the municipalities of Bern, Ittigen, Zollikofen, Bremgarten b.Bern., Kirchlindach and Wohlen b.Bern are involved.
In the future, the canton of Bern wants to cover 40 percent of the costs for these projects recorded in the fact plan - the rest falls on the municipalities.It is no coincidence that the canton is now forward.Due to the Corona crisis, bicycle traffic recently gained a lot of growth because many people avoid public transport.
Parliament also has further pressure.Green Grand Councilor Bruno Vanoni submitted another advance last week, in which he demands a rapid closure of existing gaps in the bike traffic network and the creation of new priority routes.For his motion, he was able to win co -signers from all large parties - from SP to SVP - in the Grand Council.

Metzler dismissal are used to Zurich women.For example in restaurant reserves.One asks for a table, the voice on the phone answers: We have been fully booked for a long time.
This experience has just expanded to a new industry, the bike dealers.Patch the torn brake cable?We have been fully booked for a long time.
The Corona Lockdown triggered a storm on the bike in Zurich.While other industries are doing it, the bike mechanics sink into the works.The “Tages-Anzeiger” asked around ten Zurich bike shops.
Everyone reports the same thing: it runs like crazy.Just like never before.
They have sold between 20 and 60 percent more bicycles than at the same time in the previous year.Many dealers could have brought more bicycles to people.If they had them.
Several brands are on the stop with the production, they say.The delivery times often cheat for months.The shops that have started with a full camp in the year are happy.
Unpopular internet bike spontaneous repairs were hardly possible because of their many work, most dealers say.Until you get a maintenance date, weeks can pass.And mostly, only those who bought the bike from the same mechanic are taken into account.
With a bike from the Internet, you are currently currently encountering locked workshops.E-bikes, cargo e bikes (with loading area), gravel bikes (a mixture of racing bike and mountain bike) and children's bike have proven to be particularly in demand.Racing bikes are also going well.
With the electrovelos, the popularity can be pursued statistically because they need a number.The number of e-bikes newly dissolved at the cantonal road traffic office has increased significantly.The boom is remarkable, since according to their own statements, the Velohändler was very good last summer.
It's a boom on a boom.It is still noteworthy that the boom continues, although the Swiss women have been allowed to do almost everything since the end of the Lockdown;And although May and June failed with the weather.
"Last year it was much nicer in this crucial phase," says Martin Platter, managing director of the industry organization Velosuisse.Usually bad weather presses directly onto the sales figures."Now people are also in front of the shops in the rain." The
Dealers have several explanations for success.When almost nothing was allowed during the Corona arrest, the bike promised freedom.The home office created time niches to use this freedom.
And many Swiss people had planned bike holidays this summer because they don't want to travel abroad.Popular long -hauled rush in the shops is noticeable on the streets.
Kay Axhausen, Professor of Transport Planning at ETH, has investigated how the Lockdown changes the Swiss traffic behavior.The previous conclusion: Velo beats a car.At the end of June, the Swiss train, bus and tram still used less frequently than before.
They drove the same far in the car."And with the bike, the Swiss make up to half more kilometers than usual," says Axhausen.The evaluation is based on around 800 volunteers who have their movement behavior tracked on the cell phone.
The 21 urban counting points at which the civil engineering office raises a significant increase in how many cyclists come by per day.With almost all points, the values have been skyrocketed since mid -May.This has been particularly strong on the Langstrasse.
Due to the underpass between district 4 and 5, around 16,000 people cycled on Tuesday, July 7th.That is more than twice as many as on an average January day.In June, the values at selected urban counties were up to 260 percent higher than the average value of the previous year.
However, the recurring summer rise also plays.The city wants to present a more precise evaluation at the end of August.Mobility test has still been open to what people need the new bicycles for.
For fun ?As a sports equipment?Or to get to the office?
The subjects of Kay Axhausen are mainly on the road with the bike at the end of the afternoon."This suggests a leisure use," says Axhausen.It fits that the urban counting points record the highest rashes on Saturdays.
Two national bicycles support the recreation of leisure.Outside the city, they say, they hardly see more people on Velos during the week than before Corona.Only electricity -powered bikes seem to serve less than leisure vehicles.
"Our customers need the e-bike to commute, shop or to get the children out of the crib," says Daniel Meyer by ego Movement, an e-bike dealer with two branches in Zurich.A survey showed that 53 percent of EGO-Movement customers switch from the car to the e-bike.According to Kay Axhausen, the Corona mobility test is still pending.
Many employees continued to work at home.This could change in autumn.At the same time, some of the commuters will still avoid public transport for fear of infection.
"If you all switch to the car, there will be more traffic jams and the speed on the street will continue to slow down." The bike is offering itself as an alternative.
"However, there must be the willingness to protect yourself against rain and cold with the right equipment," says Axhausen.According to Martin Platter from Velosuisse, the bike clothing has made great progress in recent years.The requested dealers doubt whether the record sales lead to a noticeably more everyday bike rides.
To do this, the bike paths in the city would have to get better, many of them write.Martin Platter from Velosuisse also relies on the new popularity of the children's bike."Children who like to drive bike will probably also do as adults." For this article, the "Tages-Anzeiger" has sent questions to over a dozen randomly selected bike dealers with branches in the city of Zurich.
The following answered: Backyard, Cycle Store, Ego Movement, Happybike, Veloatelier, Velofix, Velomärkte.ch, Veloplus, Velo Zurich and two -wheeler.He can rarely rest: Ramesh Thambiah, the boss of Velofix in Wiedikon, has a lot to do, like all Zurich Velomechanics.

In 2019 the cantonal police recorded 6581 stolen bicycles, in the city of Zurich alone there were 2737. Velos are mostly stolen by all vehicles, at the same time the clearance rate is 3.6 percent deep.For comparison: In 2019 there were 178 car theft in the canton of Zurich, in two thirds of which the police caught the perpetrators.

25 kilometers of bicycle routes in Winterthur / / Verkehr Winterthur makes forward with the bicycle routes.The city council reports 25 kilometers by 2030.
It starts with a route from lakes to the city center, which is built in 2021/22.The city council puts a question mark behind the term “bicycle route” because the word “quickly” could cause fears.The routes are also intended for fast e-bikes, but above all the bicycles should be a safe terrain for all cyclists.
Therefore, they should be related, direct, safe, attractive and with the same color.The security also includes that combined foot and bicycle paths are dispensed with.The city council has a small swipe against Zurich.
"Winterthur can be regarded within the canton of Zurich as a pilot city for the implementation of bicycle routes," he writes.In fact, the gross trains were already decided in 2014, and the routes have been secured since 2016.In Zurich, the voting people will decide on the Velorouute initiative at the end of September, which demands a network of at least 50 kilometers within 10 years.

At the Bahnhofquai there are two new bicycle paths / / bikes, cars, cars The city of Zurich makes serious with the bike offensive - at the expense of private transport:
At the Bahnhofquai, she is building two new bike strips and picks up a lane.Since Monday, all bicycles who are traveling between Uraniastrasse or Rudolf-Brun-Brun and Beatenplatz has been available in both directions.So if you are traveling on the train station on the train station at the bike and want to turn right into Uraniastrasse, you can drive on your own lane as well as those who cycle to Beatenplatz in the opposite direction from the Rudolf Brun Bridge.
So far, there have only been a continuous bike strip for bicycle travelers who drove from the train station to the Rudolf-Brun Brücke.So that three wheel strips can be offered on this section of the road, the city of Zurich has broken down a car lane.The individual transport is newly available from the train station towards Uraniastrasse.
This is possible without loss of performance, it says on the part of the city.The section of the road is part of the regional cycle path network.The adjustment was made as part of the renewal of the deck cover.

"I don't want to wait until 2095" / right of two bike Florian Utz is the head behind the bike route initiative.The SP municipal council calls for a 50-kilometer cycle path network in the city of Zurich.
That is pure selfishness of the bike bobby, the opponents say.Ev Manz (text) and Anna-Tia Buss (photos) Florian Utz drives Velo as he argues.Pragmatic correct.
"I don't like populism," says the 40-year-old.The Zürcher SP council is the head behind the project that the city-angry population will vote on September 27: In ten years, a star-shaped network of 50 kilometers is to be built on urban quarters, which is reserved for cyclists and only the feeder service and residentsallowed .
Utz, a lawyer and clerk for criminal law at the Zurich district court, drives through the city with the bike every day.Mostly with his "slow" e-bike.He has been in parliament for ten years, so far he has hardly noticed prestigious advances.
Now he is in the spotlight for the first time.Because he wants to solve a problem: «More than half of all bicycle people feel unsafe on the Zurich streets, many places are objectively dangerous, the number of accidents have doubled between 2011 and 2019.»The initiative developed from this analysis and personal dismay.
"No beer idea".It was created at lunch with Oliver Heimgartner, the Co-President of the city party."We have burned a lot of brainworm so that the matter becomes a profit for all road users," says Utz.
The support of the city council and the GLP or the JA slogan of the EVP. On a bike ride through the city, Utz explains his concern.
In the late afternoon, countless bicycles and cars avoid the fountain."The principle of the bike route initiative can best be explained here," he says, "this grooving traffic endangers the bike." According to
Utz ’idea would be reserved for bicycles and Sihlfeldstrasse to the bicycles, the motorized through traffic would be led via Hard- and Badenerstrasse."This simplifies the situation without any losses for both road users." However, this is no longer an orderly coexistence for the SVP.
"This is a displacement of private and commercial private transport," says municipal councilor Derek Richter.It is usually on foot or commercially motorized.The SP initiative does the opposite, car traffic is increasing.
The handlebars would be forced to detour, the pedestrians were too short.«This exclusivity in favor of the bike bobby is pure selfishness on the left-green side.»Especially at best only two percent of the person kilometers driven in the city area would be covered with the bike and the bike is a good weather.
Utz does not deny that fewer people drive bike in rain;According to urban statistics, bicycle traffic decreases by about a third in bad weather.However, he does not see this as an argument against the initiative: "Safe bicycle routes are particularly important in bad weather and correspondingly poor visibility." - Feldstrasse:
The place on the Feldstrasse, height tram station bakery system, carefully brakes Utz."It is obvious here how dangerously cycling in the city of Zurich is," he says.Tram, car and bike share a trail, the space is scarce, there is no bike strip, the sidewalks are high.
The Feldstrasse is not intended in the network of the initiative.The SP has submitted a proposal to the city that the civil engineering office would decide on the concrete implementation.For the SVP, the space in the city of Zurich is simply too scarce to clear it exclusively for a single road user.
Utz wants to redistribute the existing place with his initiative.“It is crucial how often city -wrinkles ride car and bike in comparison.»According to statistics, 26 percent run twice a week, 22 percent twice car.
The Corona Lockdown in particular showed that the bike is a real alternative to public transport for many."But the infrastructure for cars is much better developed than that for Velos." With the Masterplan Velo from 2012, the city wanted to create around 150 kilometers of bike strips in classes A and A+ by 2025, which means at least 1.5 meters wide.A good 43 percent of the main route network today correspond to this standard, within eight years this number has increased by only 5 percent.
According to a population survey of 2019, only a quarter of the bike travelers are satisfied with the infrastructure.Utz calculates.“If the implementation continues at the pace, the city did not meet the master plan until 2095.
I don't want to wait until then. »Like the SVP, the FDP is too uncompromising the initiative.Her counter -proposal to improve the infrastructure without a mileage with no mileage as required did not find a majority in parliament.FDP councilor
Martina Zürcher is traveling with the bike every day and says: «The city is already doing what you can see on Baslerstrasse.»Your party prefers solutions that took into account the entire traffic policy and compensated for abolished parking spaces elsewhere in the city.
It also tries with the proposed star -shaped network.«Zurich is not as flat as Paris.We need parallel routes on the slope.
And more innovative solutions.»She thinks of a tunnel from Wipkingen to Oerlikon.— Langstrasse / Lagerstrasse: Wetting the infrastructure noise is not Florian Utz’ art.
It praises the new bicycles and the separate waiting area - the so -called bicycle sac - at the intersection Neufrankengasse / Langstrasse.«Not perfectly perfect, but an improvement for bicycle travelers.»
Half a dozen of them waiting for the greenlight of the traffic lights on and next to the area.It is already too small for Utz today.He also praises the 1.8 meter wide bicycle strip on the Lagerstrasse, one of the few in the city with Standard A+.
The Löwenstrasse security is going past the train station to the Central.In front of the ward of the polybahn, the bike strip on the edge ends abruptly, only a few meters later it continues between two traces of car.Florian Utz points out that for safety when crossing the road, a flat ground mark is needed.
Of the traffic fatalities, which were counted in the canton of Zurich in 2018, 80 percent were two -wheeler travelers.For Utz, however, security also has to do with the awareness of everyone who is on the road.He compares Zurich with Portland in the USA.
There, the proportion of bicycle traffic rose from 1.2 to 6 percent between 1990 and 2010;The fatal accidents dropped by 75 percent."Studies show that there are fewer accidents when more people bike and there are safe bicycle routes." SVP politician Derek Richter sees it differently: "If you read the statistics of bike accidents, it becomes clear:
The majority of the accidents happened because of partly grossly negligent self -fault. » - Scheuchzerstrasse: The implementation tests with bike streets have already done the city, also on Scheuchzerstrasse.In 2017, the government council deleted it from the regional structure plan because the legal basis was missing.
Utz says: «The project at the time was very well received by the population, as the surveys show.“Why the city did not use the Lockdown to test pop-up velor routes such as in Barcelona or Brussels is beyond it.Opponents like SVP politicians
Richter fear that the initiative creates velorenbahnen.«Racing and e-bike drivers are a danger to cars and pedestrians.»The pace on the bike routes would be limited to 30 kilometers per hour.
The police don't control that anyway, says Richter.FDP municipal councilor Zürcher also appeals to the bicycles: "If you would stick more to the rules, other road users would also be more tolerant towards them." Finally, the costs of Florian Utz’s leadership.
It gets little concrete.That depends on the exact implementation."But the city has probably never created so many kilometers of bike frastructure," he says.
Utz thinks of simple measures such as the interruption of neighborhood streets with planters or posts, so that the bike routes are freed from motorized through traffic.A ban for this is more difficult to control.A little more precisely, in Franconia?
Utz: "In the single -digit million range." Hotspots on the tour to the concerns of the Velorouuteninitiative Ablorian Utz is on the road with the bike in the city every day and knows the situation on the street.Not everything is bad:
Utz praises the “Velosack” on the corner of Neufrankengasse and Langstrasse. ”The infrastructure for cars is much better developed than that for Velos.” Florian Utz SP council and father of the bicycle initiative initiative
On September 27, secure bike veloroutendie City of Zurich coordinates a Velonetz with star -shaped and tangential routes of at least 50 kilometers in length.
The city is said to use little -used neighborhood roads on which no cars drive and cyclists have progressed.Residents, traders and blue light organizations would be allowed to serve the feeder service.On the routes, speed 30, fast e-bikes should not be used.

Canton invests a record amount in Velowege / / CHF 72 million in Valaisellen, Wangen-Brüttisellen and Dietlikon Get Velopendler two comfortable new routes.
The goal: The bike content on the traffic in the Glattal should increase strikingly.At this media conference on Tuesday, Liliane Minores spoke a lot of superlatives: a "milestone", a "quantum leap in bike promotion", even about an "incredible, huge chance".And all of this in connection with five kilometers of Veloweg in the Glattal.
More precisely in Valaisellen, Dietlikon and Wangen-Brüttisellen.However, there are five kilometers that have it all in every respect: For the first time, the canton is building bike routes here, which are mainly designed for commuters and should make them possible in quick progress without conflicts by car traffic.
This has its price: the canton wants to invest almost 72 million francs."This is a lot of money," admitted FDP Volkswirtschaftsdiverin Carmen Walker in front of the media, "but we also get a lot for it." On the one hand, the canton is planning a bike river in the canton concrete, the very first in the cantonal cycle network.
It connects the city of Saatlen-Quartier with the underpass width in the center of Valaisellen.This route will be 4.8 meters wide over long distances, this is enough so that two bicycles can run next to each other in both directions.Next to it is a two -meter -wide footpath.
This building should cost a good CHF 23 million.On the other hand, there is a three -kilometer Velohauptraute, also along the railway line between the Dietlikon railway underpass and Zurichstrasse in Brüttisellen.It is 3.6 meters wide, which enables a problem -free overtaking.
The lion's share of the planned costs, around CHF 48 million, is no longer necessary.The reason for the high costs are two new underpasses that connect the Veloweg under the railway line to the town center of Brüttisellen.In addition, bridges are planned for larger cross -roads to defuse conflicts with car traffic as possible. "There is no better time" The question arises:
Why is the canton investing so much here and especially now?There are two answers to that.On the one hand, the SBB will build a new train tunnel, the Brüttener Tunnel, which will lead from Dietlikon and Bassersdorf to Winterthur in the coming years.
In this context, the SBB also expand the railway line that leads to the tunnel.A new viaduct is planned in Valaisellen. "We will virtually circumvent the region," said Markus Traber, head of the cantonal office.This is a unique opportunity to expand the bicycle paths along these new railway lines at the same time, because the existing paths should have been relocated anyway: "There is no better time, the planned routes can no longer be created afterwards." On the other hand, it is an explainedThe goal of the government council to bring more people to the bike.
In 2030, eight percent of all path stages are to be covered with the bike - around a third more than today.The densely populated, relatively flat Glattal is supposed to "make disproportionately contribute to this growth", as government councilor Walker Späh said."However, this is only possible if bike routes are safe, complete, direct and comfortable." In any case, the right moment is to intensify bike promotion, added Markus Traber.
The number of bicycles is growing, and the Corona crisis gave this growth additional thrust: «The bike infrastructure is getting more and more to the limit, and earlier than expected.»Therefore, investments are urgently needed to meet increasing demand.The canton uses the construction work on the railway line for another comparatively modest project with costs of around CHF 1.4 million:
In Bassersdorf, the planned new Kantonsstrasse south of the railway line is supplemented by its own bus lane.The bicycle paths and the bus lane from the cantonal street fund are financed.The government council spoke out for the project at the last meeting, now the cantonal council has to give its blessing, which should be a matter of form in the current majorities.
A referendum would also be possible.It is only in ten years in the company Velowege and bus track closely linked to the construction work at the Brüttener tunnel, it will take a few years before they can be tackled.The planned construction for the train systems is 2026 - provided the project is not delayed by objections.
The bus lane should be finished in the same year.The Veloroute in Valaisellen will then go into operation in 2031, those in Dietlikon and Wangen-Brüttisellen in 2032.New bicycle paths and new bus lanes are said to look like the planned railway viaduct between Valaisellen and Oerlikon next to the planned railway viaduct.

Canton Zurich builds the first Velo Highway / / Mobility
The canton of Zurich wants to put around CHF 72 million into the expansion of the bike paths in the middle Glattal.The first bike fast road of the canton is to be built in Valaisellen.The construction project, which government councilor Carmen Walker Späh (FDP) referred to as "milestone", is related to the construction of the Brütten tunnel:
The cycle paths are created at the same time as the railway lines are expanded.The canton of Zurich wants to significantly increase bicycle traffic in the next few years, and the Glattal should “contribute disproportionately”.(Leu) Page 17

Should Zurich become a bike city?/ / Voting of September 27th 50 kilometers of new bicycle paths are to be created on neighborhood roads within ten years, the initiative calls for “Safe Velorouuten for Zurich”.Answers to the city -angry template.
EV Manzwas wants the initiative?By 2030, the initiative plans to create a star -shaped network of 50 kilometers of bike routes on neighborhood streets where bicycle travelers have progressed.The routes should be free of motorized through traffic.
Local residents, traders as well as the police and fire brigade are entitled to feed.In addition, other bicycle paths are to be expanded - for example with bike strips of knot access.The initiators proposed a network of paths to the city.
They leave the implementation to her and request an interim report every year.How do the supporters argue?More and more people are moving through the city by bike.
Compared to 2012, in 2018 there were 1.5 times as many.Since Corona, the number of paths traveled has increased again by bike.At the same time, the number of bike accidents has risen from 264 to 555 in last nine years.
For the city, this high number is "attributable to the infrastructure that is not appropriate to the quantities".That is why the city council also supports the popular initiative, which has been equivalent to a novelty for decades.Can accidents be avoided on separated bike routes?
According to a study from the United States, protected bicycle paths correlate most clearly with fewer accidental deaths.The subjective feeling of security increases, the more visible for road users the space assigned to them.Portland in the state of Oregon has introduced separate Velowege in recent years.
The number of bicycle travelers quadrupled - the fatal accidents dropped by 75 percent.The Axa Winterthur insurance also demands separated bike tracks in cities.Do cyclists actually have to drive on bike paths?
Yes, in Switzerland there is an obligation to use for bicycle paths if they are clearly signalized as such.In the event of disregard, a bus of CHF 100 threatens, in the event of an accident, the liability question becomes complicated.The same obligation to use, for example, was also in Munich.
However, because the narrow cycle paths are too dangerous in many places, the city abolishes the obligation to use them selectively and recommends using cyclists to use the street for more visibility.Can it be avoided that the routes become “Veloraser” routes?Tempo 30 should apply on the bike routes, e-bikes are not allowed.
What are the consequences of the initiative for foot and mobilized traffic?The safety of the pedestrians on the sidewalk is increased because false bicycle is eliminated.Mobilized traffic can better circulate on the axes assigned to them because it does not have to share the street space by bike.
Disadvantages of the template may be that private and commercial traffic is displaced and the detours can increase.In addition, foot traffic is neglected and may be at risk when crossing the routes.There is also no view of the entire transport policy.
Why exactly 50 kilometers?The initiators are based on the Velo master plan from 2012. This provides for a continuous cycle path network with around 150 kilometers of main and secondary routes by 2025.
There were around 60 kilometers in 2012, and 7 kilometers have been added since then.The initiative wants to make a decisive contribution to achieve the aim of the city.The FDP wanted to advance the expansion in a chanceless counter -proposal without a fixed kilometer number.
How does the implementation work and what does it cost?The initiative committee provides for smaller structural solutions - for example planting troughs on roads that stop motorized traffic.At most, parking spaces must be lifted or transferred.
The initiators expect costs in the single -digit million range.From the opponent's point of view, abolished parking spaces have to be replaced elsewhere in the city.What are the arguments of the opponents?
From an opponent's point of view, the place in the city is too scarce to separate road users.The SVP and the trade association fear displacement of private and commercial private transport and thus a loss of customer.Due to the detours, the traffic also increases.
For the FDP, the street space must be divided carefully.A star -shaped network does not fit Zurich.Routes run in parallel to the slope.
The FDP counter-proposal in parliament and city council remained without a chance.Proposal for 50 kilometers of bicycle routes, cars, bus and Velos share the Waffenplatzstrasse.The route is popular with motorized through traffic to bypass the traffic jam feeder.
This changes the initiative: the Waffenplatzstrasse is to become a bicycle route and consistently run through traffic via the A3, the Seestrasse and the Mythenquai.Bus, cars and bicycles on Waffenplatzstrasse.

Two bicycle traces are displaced by a bus lane / / traffic Velos should drive through the underpass on Zurich Langstrasse - like the motor vehicles.
The situation for cyclists in the long-road underpass has been a nuisance for years.Even if new soil markings have brought some relaxation in the two narrow foot and bike tunnels.On Friday, the city has now published plans for how it wants to make the underpass among SBB tracks between circles 4 and 5 safer for bike drivers-in a simple, quick and inexpensive way, as the City Council of City Councilor Richard Wolff reports on request.
Now the cyclists should not only be able to drive on the two tight tunnels on the pages, but also the large tunnel in the middle, which previously only belonged to motorized traffic.There you will receive your own two -meter wide track in both directions.The city strokes the separate bus lane in the underpass, which leads from the Limmatplatz towards Helvetiaplatz.
The buses in this direction of travel now share a trail with the cars.The turn for cars that leads into the camp street remains.In the direction of travel Limmatplatz, everything remains the same for the motorized vehicles: cars and buses are already shared today.
For the bus, there is no disadvantage.The city wants to control the light signals so that the lanes in the tunnel quickly empty and the buses do not lose time, writes the civil engineering department.It is not the only news about the underpass.
The city is planning some changes, especially on the page in district 4, at Lagerstrasse and Neufrankengasse.So she adapts the situation at the intersection to the camp street, which had brought her a little more than a year ago to her.If you want to drive the bike to the Lagerstrasse with the bike 5, you will be confronted with yellow sharks on the roadside that signal that the bicycles have no progress.
If you then drive on and turn left into the Lagerstrasse, meet a traffic island with a 15 centimeter high curb.The cyclists therefore have to use the pedestrian strip.The city will now remove this obstacle.
The city also wants to significantly mark the lanes for the bicycles at this intersection.According to the civil engineering department, the plans are to be realized in the coming year.In 2023, construction should then be the start of the long-planned widening of the two narrow pedestrian and bike tunnels on the side of the underpass.
The city continues to do this project.The process continues because it is very complex.Thomas Zemp

Switzerland switches a gear higher / / Helmut Stalderes was a clear call when the people wrote the promotion of the bike paths into the constitution.Three quarters of the voters said that the federal government supported the cantons in the expansion and structure of the bicycle path networks.
Now, two years later, the bike has received thrust nationwide.In large cities, agglomerations and municipalities, many projects have progressed, from individual wheel strips to new bicycle routes to well -planned bicycles."Legitimation has increased through the clear referendum, and the motivation to become active," believes Christoph Merkli from the Pro Velo interest association.
Because the expectation of the population was great, planning has been accelerated or newly tackled.The federal government also turned money from agglomeration buttocks.In May he presented the execution law for the bike article.
The cantons are obliged to plan biking paths for everyday life and leisure and to ensure continuous, cross -community networks.The federal government provides for this: the networks must open up residential areas, schools, work locations, public institutions, stops and leisure sites.
They should be expanded directly, safely, homogeneously and, if possible, separated from a different traffic.In its own area, for example in the case of motorway connections or on national streets with mixed traffic, the federal government itself wants to realize bicycle paths.The draft law was well received by parties, cantons and associations.
The potential of the bike can be exploited as an efficient, space -saving means of transport and increased, the tenor was.Especially in the urban area, attractive networks contribute significantly to relieve the streets, trams and buses.And with fast routes, e-bikes reached a radius of up to 25 kilometers, so that they also alleviated the commuter flows on the street and rail.
From different sides there is now the demand that the federal government should speak more money for bicycle traffic.This is to be done through the agglomeration programs with which the federal government already co -financed traffic buildings in cities and agglomerations.The Swiss City Association requires that new 12 to 15 percent (now 9 to 12 percent) of the funds in the national road and agglomeration fund will flow into traffic improvements in cities and their surrounding area.
Instead of CHF 390 million annually, CHF 500 million could be used for agglomeration programs and correspondingly more for the bike frastructure."With the constitutional article, the federal government is asked to get more committed to bicycle traffic," said Paul Schneeberger, Head of Transport Policy.This means that bicycle traffic is a task of the federal government, cantons and municipalities.
«If the support is to be sustainable, considerable sums are necessary.Therefore, a recovery of the funds is attached to the fund.»Christoph Merkli from Pro Velo comes into the same horn.
The proportion of subsidies in bicycle structures in the agglomerations should be increased from 50 to 75 percent today.Velor routes along the railways. Further demand comes from the conference of the cantonal construction, planning and environmental directors.
They want more bicycle paths and fast routes to be realized along train lines.Whenever a railway line is rebuilt or changed, this should be checked, the building directors demand.The financing of such bike paths should be ensured with federal funds.
A heated bicycle highway in the Baselbietdgy.· The city of Basel does everything for the cyclists, while Baselland is an auto canton-this is what the traditional distribution of roles of the two neighbors looks like.
Thousands commute to Basel to the office every day and back to Augst, Therwil or Arlesheim in the evening.OV and car are the preferred modes of transport, which is reflected in overcrowded streets and access parts.But now the e-bike trend ensures a new dynamic.
Even larger distances from one canton in the other suddenly become two -wheeled.The canton of Basel landscape wants to promote e-mobility and the potential for bicycle and pedestrian traffic in the compacted agglomeration and build up a new infrastructure.The green building director Isaac Reber, which has only been heading to the department since last year, is responsible.
In the agglomerations, traffic growth and the narrow space required new solutions: Together with the Federal Office of Strassen (Astra), the canton is planning a bird bike between Pratteln and Augst as a pilot project.It is to be completed in time for the Swiss Swing and Calpler Festival in August 2022.
The highway is constructed from 20 meter long wood-light construction modules.Two directional lanes are planned on several meters above the ground.Sensors and digital technology ensure that alarm automatically triggered in the event of accidents or that the built -in heating is switched on in the event of frost.
The system should not only cause a stir in northwestern Switzerland, but later internationally."What was the motorways 60 years ago, which at the time revolutionized traffic in Switzerland, could soon be Velobahn," predicted the construction director Reber at the presentation before the media.For the time being, the project is promoted to the headlines due to accusations of felt.
The patent for the new, high-altitude system lies with a company in which Klaus Kirchmayr is involved, a district administrator of the Greens.Kirchmayr is not only friends with Reber, but also submitted the advance for a bicycle fast railway in parliament.The participants disclose the allegation of the nepotism.
The affair currently keeps local politics up to trot - but outside the canton, the experiment remains particularly interesting: According to an analysis of the Astra, bicycles do up to 4 percent less traffic on the motorways.That is already enough to liquefy car traffic.
Cities in western Switzerland fetch.· «VeloKrieg in Geneva» - the headlines were not exactly squeamish this summer, but came quite close to reality.Nowhere in western Switzerland was the measures to promote slow traffic as loudly as at the western end of Lake Geneva.
Everything went back to a communiqué of the State Council on April 30th.Without having agreed with the usual interest groups beforehand, the government announced "various measures over the next few weeks in favor of foot and bicycle traffic".If necessary, these were quickly lifted again, it said.
The reason for the quick shot: The authorities feared that after the lifting of the partial lockdown, significantly more people would drive to the city than before and that the streets that are already heavily frequented would be completely overloaded.A little later the authorities went to act:
On numerous streets, some of some main traffic axes, cars of cars were broken down and converted into Velo paths.Parking spaces were also lifted.The outcry was not long in coming.
The association transport and mobility, led by the TCS, reported “absurd route guides” and complained in particular that the already battered trade would also suffer from the “harassment” for car and motorbike drivers.The association called for the return to the status quo ante within a maximum of two months.In order to increase the pressure on politics, several hundred motorcyclists chugged through Geneva city center in early July.
However, the canton showed little hearing.On September 7, what the critics had feared from the start - that the temporary steps ultimately became long -term.For the time being, the measures should be significantly extended before "definitive buildings" are then realized according to the government.
It feels confirmed by recent surveys that bike at two measuring points increased by 22 percent compared to the previous year.The last word will of course have the dishes, since numerous complaints are pending.It is a bit more peaceful in the Vaud - but the direction is the same: more space for the bicycles.
At the beginning of June, the cantonal government presented a plan that provides 100 kilometers of additional bike strips on the cantonal streets.At the same time, she asked the municipalities to also implement projects in favor of slow traffic in her area.Lausanne could not be asked twice.
Due to the hilly topography, the fourth largest city in Switzerland has not yet been particularly popular with cyclists, the e-bike boom and safer bicycle paths are now to change.In Lausanne, several roads of roads have already been converted in such a way that the bicycles no longer have to meander through the other traffic - partly at the expense of parking spaces.In medium -sized Vaud cities such as Yverdon, Morges or Nyon, further projects are underway.
Integration of bike compounds in the Brüttener Tunnelsho.· The paradigm shift took place four years ago.
Until then, the bike stood for the authorities in the canton of Zurich, especially for leisure traffic.So in rural areas they built cycle paths that Gümmeler and mountain bikers delighted, but were of little importance in the sense of overall traffic.With the 2016 Velonetz plan, the canton focused on agglomerations and commuters.
The aim is that a relevant part of future multi -traffic up to 15 kilometers of distance can be covered with the bike.A few days ago, the economic director Carmen Walker Späh (FDP.) Presented a specific project - with a surprise.Two new bike compounds are integrated into the Brüttener Tunnel project and built by the SBB.
In order to remedy the bottleneck in the rail network between Winterthur and Effretikon by 2035, the construction of the 9 -kilometer tube is not enough.Adjustments to the 19th century to Oerlikon are necessary.It is necessary to move the pathway in Valaisellen.
The canton takes the opportunity to build the first bicycle route in the canton along the train tracks to Zurich.This is free of obstacles and so wide that in both directions two bikes each have space next to each other.The section is the first piece of the VeloSchnell route from the Zurich Oberland to Zurich North.
A less wide, new bike connection is created from cheeks-brüttisellen to Dietlikon, also along the railway line.With almost 50 million francs, the costs are considerable because two new rail underpasses are drawn up.But it was "now or never", as Walker said.
After the railway expansion, the construction of the bike compounds would no longer have been possible.The downer: it takes ten years.Private also get involved.
In the airport region, real estate companies roll plans for a “flyline” from Oerlikon to the aviation center.The full use of the property in this area would lead to traffic collapse.Due to a lack of space, the «Flyline» should partly lead over an increased route.
It is open whether it becomes of it.However, it is remarkable, like large landowners who have little to do with the bike itself to solve the problems.A special feature in the canton of Zurich is that the cities of Zurich and Winterthur are responsible for the over -communal streets in their field.
This regularly leads to friction with the canton, as is currently the case with the Bellerive route.Fast, space -saving, efficient, environmentally friendly - cities want to defuse traffic problems with bike funding.

The radical confession is still missing / / analysis The plans for the Zurich bike year 2021 are large - bike routes and a partnership are pending.
But the start has failed.Snow and cold are currently passing away from the streets.In the city of Zurich, however, bike is still omnipresent - at least in theory.
By the end of 2021, the first five kilometers of the bicycle routes must be realized in the city area.The “Safe Velorouten” initiative and over 70 percent of the city population, which the initiative had accepted at the end of September, demanded it.In addition, “safe bike” is the reason for a temporary town twinning with the Styrian state capital Graz.
And the bike strategy 2030 has also been announced.So it would be ensured.In practice, on the street, however, the implementation is only hesitant.
Parking spaces disappear in places such as the Kasernenstrasse, and bike strips are extended.At Bucheggplatz, cars that turn into Bucheggstrasse have to revive a post.And a traffic island was built on Hubertus, where there was a fatal accident at the end of 2019.
The city has formed a Velo Express team for such measures.Zurich had also attached the 81 signs for turning right at Red to all other Swiss cities.But the momentum for the big milestones is missing.
The city should have been presented by a concept for the 50 -kilometer network with bicycle routes by the end of last year.So far she has not done it - and didn't inform either.Even at yesterday's annual media conference, the representatives of the civil engineering office had not lost a word about it if they had not been asked for it.
Head of Office Simone Rangosch said that the detailed plans were currently on voting with the municipal execution plan, and put it over to early summer.City Councilor Richard Wolff (al) expanded the time span to "in the course of summer", on the grounds that the city council and the municipal council still wanted to have a "have a say".contest.You go back to a promotion of the two municipal councils Sven Sobernheim (GLP) and Marc Denoth (SP) from 2017.
However, the implementation of the first section in November shows that this section does not correspond to a street in the sense of the initiators of the Velorouute template.It is anything but freed from motorized through traffic.That shouldn't change so quickly either:
According to Head of Rangos, this is "very difficult in the future". The civil engineering office emphasizes that it deliberately thinks the street space.No longer from the middle, i.e. from the car, but from the edge, the pedestrians in the main focus, the "quality of stay" in the increasingly growing city must be guaranteed.The rising place for the bike is mentioned in a subordinate clause.
The bicycle bby and the SP as an initian wanted a more radical rethink: the street space must at least partially be divided separately.City councilor Davy Graf speaks of a paradigm shift: away from the small small of recent years to a real bike city.
One that also deserves this name.Richard Wolff revealed that it could be a problem in the administration on the day of the vote last September - with the choice of words.Instead of saying that the city is doing everything to meet the "great expectations", he spoke of an attempt to comply with the claims of the template.
The initiators suspected the hope of a clear commitment to the city, on the first sketches of the route network.The yes of the city council and that of the municipal council for the initiative were finally back for months, so the city would have had enough time to prepare.But they were disappointed.
And every day they doubt that the first five kilometers of the bike routes will be implemented at the end of the year.Balance will be drawn again in one year.EV Manzdas are Zurich's central bicycle projects - long -road underpass:
The bus lane in the middle is lifted as a short -term measure in favor of two meters wide bike strips.In this way, mixing traffic in the side tunnels should be relieved;They will only be rebuilt later.
Start of construction: summer 2021;Duration: 1 month. - Veloviaduct: The connection via the tracks from the PJZ on the Hohlstrasse to the wipking verviaduct is promoted.Study order: by the end of 2021;
Preliminary project: 2022. - Velotunnel: The underground connection between Sihlquai and the Kasernenstrasse will come in the next few months.Construction: 2022, end of the construction: 2024. - preferred routes: The city begins this year to signal the four bike preference routes and adapt marginal stones at the nodes.The connections of Altetten via Baslerstrasse to district 4 and those on Mühlebachstrasse in Seefeld are first controlled, in late autumn the route from Hottingen follows via Scheuchzerstrasse to Oerlikon and Affoltern.
Construction start: summer 2021. (EMA) EMA / Manz

Driving remains life -threatening / / Self -experiment on two wheels Basel allows turning right at red and plans new bike streets.Cycling is a blessing and curse at the same time.
Martin Furrerkeck claims the building and traffic department (BVD) on his website: "Basel is a Velostadt".The office even sets itself the long -term goal of making Basel the “most bike -friendly city in Switzerland”.
Anyone who steps into the pedals in a propagandistist must have deeds followed by the words.In fact, the BVD recently announced an improvement: "Velos come even more quickly from A to B."
This should be made possible thanks to two small traffic technology: the “free right -wing turn at red” and the “introduction of bike streets”. The turn of the right at red has so far been allowed at ten traffic lights in the city as part of a pilot project.In the near future it will be allowed at 30 more traffic lights.In addition, the following eight speed 30 routes are expanded into corridors in which the legal advance is canceled and bike travelers enjoy unconditional advance: Allmendstrasse, Schaffhauserrheinweg, Unterer Rheinweg, Engelgasse, Egliseestrasse, at St. Gallerring / Bernerring, Oberwilerstrasse /
Leimenstrasse and Maulbeerstrasse / Sperrstrasse.As part of a pilot test since 2016, you can only enjoy free travel since 2016 in the bike streets on St. Alban-Rheinweg and on Mülhauserstrasse.So red is the new green.
Do the streets belong entirely to the bikers in the future?Can now be ringed happily?How does she feel, the new bike freedom?
I swing on the saddle.Off to self -experiment.On Leimenstrasse, vis-à-vis of the Pauluskirche, the traffic light stands on red.
But a small, black signal panel with a painted yellow bike symbol and right arrow is the license to continue: I bend the stone ring.
“Free right turning at red” has long been valid here.Of course, I note the principle: "Pedestrians and the left -wing traffic have progressed".It also works at the intersection of Schanzenstrasse /
Spitalstrasse or at the Leimenstrasse / Steinenring branch.It's not a big thing either, this innovation.
The United States even allows you to turn red with cars for decades.From me, the regime in Basel could be introduced at 60 or 90 traffic lights instead of only 30.I continue cycling through the St. Galler and Bernerring- one of the future "bike roads".
The road is very wide here and the converter cross -roads are clear.There is hardly any traffic.After a few hundred meters I made my judgment:
Here you are already completely safe with the bike.The cancellation of the legal advantage and the conversion into a “Velostrasse” is unnecessary.If it were, other routes that one would have to privileged would exist.
For example, the Göschenenstrasse in the Neubadquartier: It could serve as an alternative route for the dangerous Neuweilerstrasse.In general, it seems illogical to me that the BVD wants to expand individual pace 30 routes to privileged two-wheeler routes.
It would be better to maintain the applicable legal rule in the 30-zones' Tempo 30 zones, to which everyone has got used to introducing new special rules on arbitrarily selected routes.Relieved red light regime or not: I am far from letting go of the handlebar for joy and triumphantly stretching my arms.
Especially since there are still many problem areas in this city that would have to be remedied.On the canton's geoportal, the neuralgic points for bicycles are marked with a red danger symbol: Neuweilerplatz, Dorenbach-Viaduct, Münchensteinerbrücke, crossing Dreikspitz, Bundesplatz.But that is by no means all delicate spots.
I drive over the market hall bridge and turn into Elisabethenstrasse.The wind whistles around the Velohelm: Here it is easy to get down, you can make pace without sweating.
Then comes the Kirschgarten BVB stop with its high holding edge.Now brakes are announced.I sway, even though no car is approaching and I, honor word, have no per thousand per thousand:
The distance between the holding edge and tram track is simply too narrow.Almost acrobatic skills are demanded here.If it were also raining or a car would overtake me a little and maybe sweep a gust of wind over the street - I ran in danger.
These stops may be a blessing for the disabled in a wheelchair.They are a curse for cyclists.A year ago, the Grand Council's Traffic Commission called for the city to forego the remodeling of the stops and prefer to equip trams with sliding kicks.
Nothing has happened so far.On the contrary .At the beginning of March, the BVD announced that the territory was being renovated.
The three BVB stops Brauensbad, Schützenmattstrasse and Holbeinstrasse would be rebuilt, so that passengers can "get in continuously in the future".That means once again for cyclists: be careful, high sidewalks.After all, the BVD intends to incorporate bike -friendly tram tracks.
These are provided with a rubber profile.So bicycles shouldn't get stuck in the rail.However, the profiles should only be used if a test on Bruderholzstrasse is positive.
The attempt with the bike -friendly track starts at the end of this year.It will not be evaluated until the end of next year.I get down from the saddle again and think:
Until Basel gets into the corridor and the “most bike -friendly city in Switzerland” becomes, a lot of time will pass.Driving is fun - but the great freedom on two wheels cannot yet be celebrated in this city.Incidentally, a real threat is not only confusing intersections, certain tram stops or trucks that rush past you.
But other cyclists who push you off or - what happens more ever - overtake on the right.But that's another story.Tips and tours for cyclists:
www.basel-unterweg.ch www.bikeable.ch www.provelo-beiderbasel.chheikle situations are always available for cyclists.Here, for example, at the intersection

The Velostadt Basel carries great risks / / test drive The construction and traffic department wants to make Basel the “most bike-friendly city in Switzerland”.
In fact, it recently reported two innovations to make the life of the bike drivers easier.If you are traveling with the two -wheeler, you can turn even more traffic lights on the right at red than before.In addition, eight more will be added to the two bike breeds that already exist today.
Velostrassen are routes in Tempo 30 zones, in which the legal advance is canceled for exhaustive road users.But how safe are you really on the saddle?There are many dangers-not only on the points known by the canton as neuralgically Neuweilerplatz, Dorenbach-Viaduct, Münchensteinerbrücke, crossing Dreisspitz or Bundesplatz.

The first four fast routes should be finished in summer / / / Velostrategy 2030 The city council announces the first routes and continues to file the overall network - the parties are nevertheless dissatisfied.
Ev Management patient have been waiting for Zurich's cyclists for this moment: The “Velostrategy 2030” should provide information on how Zurich becomes Velostadt.And above all, as the city implements the “Safe Velorouten” initiative, to which a majority of the vocal people said in autumn.
13 people from the security and civil engineering department have developed the strategy.Only: The motto "Safe and simply through Zurich" is not really new, and many points of the strategy were already included in the 2012 "Master Plan Velo".Safety chief Karin Rykart (Greens) and civil engineering head Richard Wolff (AL) defended themselves against this accusation at a media conference on Friday.
Wolff says: "The glass is half full and not half empty." Four preferred routes planned by 2022, the city intends to implement four bicycle routes, which the city wants to have understood as a preferred routes, with a total length of 14 kilometers.They should be completed in 2022."We can gain important experiences for the construction of other bike routes in the sense of the initiative," says city councilor Richard Wolff.
The four routes are based on a motion of the two municipal councils Marco Denoth (SP) and Sven Sobernheim (GLP) from 2017. On Baslerstrasse, that of Altstetten in district 4 (via Bulllingerstrasse and Stauffacherstrasse) was implemented at least to a bit - the city has 77 parking spacesRaid and signaled 1.5 to 2 meters wide bicycle paths.Rykart says: “We achieved a lot in a short time.»
The section is to be further improved as part of the entire expansion.A second route leads from Affoltern to Oerlikon (Bachmannweg - Riedenhaldenstrasse - Binzmühlestrasse - -Zelglis Trasse - Affolternstrasse - Regensbergstrasse), one from Kreis 7 to Oerlikon (Sonneggstrasse - Scheuchzerstrasselrchel) and one from Zollikon in district 8 (Mühlebachstrasse and Zollikerstrasse) .100 kilometersWithout dangers by 2030 velos, these sections are entitled to advance, the streets are to be signaled accordingly with large pictograms.The majority of car -free, as the initiative demands, are not.
The city does not plan structural measures that prevent through traffic."It works without", City Councilor Wolff is convinced.This would have shown him an inspection on Scheuchzerstrasse, where only living and traders are traveling by car.
You can't forbid an access to it anyway.By 2030, the city claims to have realized a 100 -kilometer network with continuous and safe bicycle routes.50 kilometers are to be implemented in the sense of the popular initiative “Safe Velor routes for Zurich”.
Rykart says: «This is more than the initiative demands.»Two thirds run away from the lines of public transport on municipal streets.Short -term measures follow this year as expected, the city council has not yet presented its draft.
He has been developed majority, but not quite yet.The city council wanted to anchor the network in the regional structure plan towards summer.That was too late for the local council, which in turn developed the municipal structure plan and actually wanted to present it these days - with the bike net plan.
Wolff says: «That accelerated the matter in a kind of kind that we hadn't expected.“The municipal council therefore stopped work, but in return asked the city council to draft the network.At the beginning of the week, the civil engineering office submitted the planning to the local council.
It is now up to him to check the plan for weaknesses.Even before summer, the Commission plans to present the municipal execution plan.It is therefore not yet clear by when further network routes are realized.
However, it is stated that all bicycle strips must be wider than 1.5 meters in the future.Until the big lines are clear, the city acts with the VeloExpress team.It removes danger zones and the focus of accidents.
For example, the city made it difficult for drivers to turn a rondell to Bucheggplatz when turning into Bucheggstrasse.In intersection areas, bike paths with red color are underlaid.With the signposting of the turning of right at the beginning of the year, bicycle traffic is liquefied.
In the long -road underpass, the city picks up a bus lane this year and signals a two -meter -wide bike strip each.At the Mythenquai, on Winterthurerstrasse, on Werdstrasse (out of town), on Molken-/Ankerstrasse and on Bederstrasse, further bicycle strips will also be marked.The city can now also plan bicycle loungers without the need to convert a road project. «The plans must now arrive on the street» The new bike strategy is not well received by all parties.
Above all at the SP, the Initian of the Velorouute Initiative.The party now fears that its project will not be implemented.SP municipal councilor Simone Brander says: "We do not accept cuts in the security of the new bike routes and will have all the attempts from the administration not to implement the initiative." They also criticize that the possibility of pop-up bikethe strategy was recorded.
The new paper is also too timid for the Greens.The plans have been good for a long time."Now the plans have to arrive on the street," says Markus Knauss.
For the AL, the city now needs bike routes, «which earn their names.Not bike strips.»It is now a matter of planning the street from outside, with wide sidewalk and at least 1.8 meters wide bike strips.
The FDP would also have liked more concrete.City council Dominique Zygmont says: «This is old wine in new hoses.»With the 100 -kilometer network, the city council takes over, especially since it is already after the planning and the implementation is more than questionable.
This is where bike preference routes are to be created on Scheuchzerstrasse: In the future, all bicycle strips must be wider than 1.5 meters.Photo: Urs Jaudas new card rated
Velowegedie Zürcher VelodeBatte is often based on the personal experience of the bike travelers.So far, an overview of which bicycle paths are and how good are missing.A group called Velobserver would like to fix this lack of objective information.
In early summer she will switch on a website that rates the urban bike compounds.The initiators want to measure the authorities on their own goal.Velobserver assesses the bike paths according to three criteria: freedom of conflict, security and attractiveness.
The initiators have to collect the data for the evaluation.To do this, use an app for the cell phone.All important routes should be recorded by autumn.
The costs are covered by donations.(BAT) BAT / Metzler Beatabel on pop-up velowegeder
Zürcher City Council does not have the realization of pop-up bike, who had requested the SP councilor Simone Brander and 32 participants in an urgent written request.As in many other cities, auto traces should be temporarily converted into bike paths in Zurich during the pandemic period.In his response to the request, the city council represents the attitude that you also want to take immediate measures to improve bicycle traffic in Zurich, but should not be reversed afterwards.
Pop-up velo paths can also hardly be implemented within which at least wherever they would bring added value.(TIF) TIF / Fassbind

City of Zurich wants to build 100 kilometers of bike routes / / mobility
The Zurich city council takes a new attempt to make the city more attractive for bicycle.By 2030, he plans to realize a 100 -kilometer network of safe and continuous bicycle routes in the city area.He anchored this in the new “Velostrategy 2030”.
Which streets the network runs is still open.According to its own statements, the city council has developed a draft, which is made public together with the municipal execution plan at the latest.It is clear, on the other hand, that the city wants to realize four preferential routes with a total of 14 kilometers by the end of 2022.
This is said to have Velo's advance;The majority of car -free, such as the “Safe Velorouten” initiative, and a majority of the city of Stadtzürcher demanded in autumn, are not the sections.The “Velostrategy 2030” not only comes up with the SP that the initiative has launched.For FDP councilor Dominique Zygmont, she is nothing but "old wine in new hoses".

Veloblitz now also gets corona tests / / logistical challenge because A-Post was too slow, covid samples are now being transported with muscle strength.
Emil Bischofberger The Black and Yellow Veloblitz jerseys are an integral part of the Zurich cityscape.On weekdays, pedals up to 35 curios through the city at the same time.
It is hardly noticeable that significantly more have been traveling since this week.Nor does it notice that some of them are green snaps - they were hired at very short notice at the weekend.Why the haste?
It was justified: the bicycle gives the cantonal Corona mass test program a speed boost.The free masses have been running since the end of March, organized by the Hirslanden group, which has received the order from the canton.
But logistics turned out to be very demanding: at the beginning, the rehearsals from companies and schools were sent to the laboratories for analysis by A-Post.The result: the results were only available 24 to 36 hours later.
Franco Marvulli also gives his courier debutdarum pedals as part of a pilot test scheduled at short notice, the curios from the bike flash with test samples through the city.Sounds simple, but needed quite a weekend effect for those responsible.They started to plan the use on Friday morning.
They had to set up an online platform for logistics, then they divided the city into six sub -areas, so -called clusters of four postcodes.A mass test is responsible for everyone.What the key question was achieved: How do you drive 30 additional bike over the weekend?
So many are necessary for the 1500 working hours that occur during the three -week pilot test."We could never have denied that with our existing staff," says Tim Keller, who coordinates the project at the Veloblitz."Our work volume has grown by a third over the weekend." Rund -SMS and emails were sent with an overwhelming result.
"We could have contested twice as many layers at short notice, so many people offered their help," says Keller.They preferred to hire former couriers because the training period is shorter.But numerous newcomers also came to the hand kiss.
With Franco Marvulli, an ex-bike professional with Seebacher roots even gives his courier debut on Monday.A bicycle layer lasts five hours, during this time there are six massest bike flashes through their respective clusters.As soon as a company registers a finished sample on the online platform, this will be reported to the courier.
"We guarantee that every rehearsal will be picked up within two hours," says Keller.The city map in the special logistics app, on which the order locations appear, makes things easier for the beginners.In addition, these are preferred in those parts of the city that they know well.
The system could do school and two properties are important for them: calm when the app reports ten orders that are waiting for collection at the same time.And strength, especially for the operations in the city's hubger clusters.
"If you were traveling on Zurichberg and Witikon for a day, you will feel what you did the next day," says Bastian Friedländer, one of the neo-bike locors."But I also know: that can be done even better!" Often Friedländer has the experience that employees of the participating companies would like to know a little more precisely how these mass tests are now.
"Then I have to say: 'I only get the rehearsals', says 23-year-old Veloblitz newcomer.The time is missing for detailed explanations.However, these would also be quite complex.
In detail, she can only explain Pascal Nydegger, which was entrusted with the reverse logistics of the mass tests.Nydegger is the founder of RiScha Taxi, a company that accomplished voluminous transports with electric shells."What we have raised here in a short time is an example of the future of the future," he says.
"This requires every ecological vehicle-as well as a platform that can map such a multi-stage logistics." The Veloblitz couriers deliver the samples in microhubs within their clusters.These have been set up on several post offices.
The microhubs, in turn, are emptied by a rickey driver every two hours and taken to the Zurich RiScha center.From there, the samples are distributed by train to the laboratories in the canton or in Lucerne, depending on the load at the individual locations.They are there four hours after collection.
"It is how it looks," says the Bernese Nydegger."I have never seen so many different people work on a project." Balance are drawn after the pilot test.The logisticians involved are already thinking about how they could permanently finish the masses.
"In Zurich we could immediately expand to 13 microhubs," says Nydegger, who can imagine that this system will be introduced in other Swiss metropolitan areas.Even at the Veloblitz, the bosses are not worried about finding additional staff permanently.With regular job advertisements, you can select from 60 applicants after two days.

"Lawless Affentheater" against "petrol bubble" / / debate about critical mass in the local council The bike event from last Friday led to a dispute in the city parliament.
At the same time, the Council decided a new bike bridge.
Beat Metzlerwas happened in the city of Zurich last Friday evening, is left-green anarchy for the SVP.Several thousand cyclists drove through the city as part of the Critical Mass.
They claimed the entire street, drivers had to wait up to half an hour.The Critical Mass actually takes place every month, but as many people as last Friday have never participated.In a declaration of parliamentary faction, the SVP criticized the event as a “danger to life and life”.
Commercials should strictly adhere to the Corona rules.But her own voters let security chief Karin Rykart (Greens) violate.The “traffic collapse” caused by the Critical Mass was also a punishment, said SVP councilor Derek Richter.
The SVP urged Rykart to stop this “lawless monkey theater for wealthy” in the future.The addressed was silent.A commuter demonstration?
So far, the city police have not requested a permit from the Critical Mass.The organizers consider one to be unnecessary.It is not a demonstration, but a normal stress on the street space.
Two green municipal councils defended this perspective.The SVP takes a car from a car, said Markus Knauss.“But if bike drivers appear in larger quantities, this should be a problem.»
In doing so, public transport disabled people much more.And for the "commuter demos" that take place every morning on the entrance axes, nobody demands a permit.Urs Riklin described the SVP speakers as "lackeys in the oil industry that live in a petrol bubble".
The real danger is based on the increasingly larger and numerous cars.SVP representatives found it "left-wing nonsense" to describe commuting as a demonstration."Zurich only works when people get their jobs," said Susanne Brunner.
Speakers from FDP and EPP let sympathy through for the event.However, it must be approved and regulated.So she becomes a happening like the Monday Night Skate.
Veloviaduct over the Greens field the Critical Mass interpreted as a further impetus to improve the “pitiful Velonetz” in the city.The local council did this in the same session.Almost without discussion, he approved CHF 6.4 million to plan a new bike bridge over the track field.
This would lead from the carbon triangle in Circle 4 to the Wipkinger Viaduct in Circle 5 and turn around 500 meters long.Among other things, it becomes necessary because the canton does not accept the bike path proposals over the hard bridge that the local council made.The bridge is of enormous importance, said Markus Knauss.
Two central bike routes would lead this.It is incomprehensible why the implementation Daure for so long.The municipal council took the first decision in 2009.
The SVP was the only party to vote against it.The bridge is far too expensive and unnecessary.She also excludes cars and public transport.
For City Councilor Richard Wolff (AL), the project shows that the city is doing much for bicycle traffic.And you shouldn't complain about the price.For the past hundred years, the city has invested "very, much more money" in the car infrastructure.
Construction via the tracks places high technical requirements.It could be in 2030 for the bridge.From then on, the Critical Mass would no longer have to occupy the hard bridge.
From the point of view of the SVP, they endanger “body and life”: cyclists of the Critical Mass last Friday on Albisriederplatz.Photo: Ennio Lanza (Keystone)

City Councilor is stroking bus lanes in favor of the bike rider / / Daniel Fritzschesie are “MR & MRS Velo” in the city of Zurich:
Civil engineering head Richard Wolff (al.) And security head Karin Rykart (Greens).On Monday, it showed that the duo has a sense of the right timing.One day after the coordination of a bike tunnel under the main train station won with almost 75 percent yes, it presented the next bike gross project.
Again, it is about crossing the mighty track field that separates the city.However, unlike the bike tunnel, which will only open in 2026, improvements for cyclists on Langstrasse have already been implemented.Cyclists are now available in the large underpass, which connects circles 4 and 5, two meters wide bicycle strips.
In addition, you can continue to use the narrower, side underpass that share pedestrians and bicycles. "Great suffering" The aim of the project was to offer bike drivers an additional, direct and safe way through the underpass ", explain the two responsibleCity council members.In fact, long -road underpass is a busy axis for two -wheelers today: around 8,500 cyclists use it every day.
The “suffering pressure” has been complaining again and again in recent years.In September 2017, the then SP President Marco Denoth put pressure in the city parliament.He submitted a motion that ultimately called for an attractive bike connection on the long road.
Denoth is now correspondingly satisfied with the result.He had personally cycled with his bike a few times through the newly designed underpass."Works well," he says.
The redesign is definitely a profit for cyclists.«It is more of a crossing of the tracks.That helps. »No self -road is also shadow where there is light.
In order to make room for the bicycles in the large underpass, the city council has lifted the previous bus track.FDP and SVP fear that the 32 bus line will be slowed down.FDP councilor Andreas Egli says: «The new bike track is certainly progress for bicycle travelers.
The disadvantage is that public transport no longer has a self -road and is slowed down."And SVP councilor Stephan Iten even finds:" The bike is holy in Zurich."The two -wheelers received more and more street space -" regardless of losses ".
ÖV and cars are too often left behind, criticizes it.This in favor of a “good weather transport means” that only makes a share of 4 to 8 percent in the total traffic volume in Zurich.The long road underpass is an example of many.
If you had to pick up the bus lane in favor of the bike, then you should have left the side, narrow underpasses alone to the footballers, it is found.This side mini tunnels are to be widened in the next few years.This is also a long -announced plan that has been moved backwards again and again.
Now it should be so far in 2026, said Wolff and Rykart on Monday.«Mr. & Mrs.Velo »in turn also emphasized that the bus - unlike feared - should not experience any disadvantage.

How much is the city of Zurich's bike rout plan worth?/ / MICHAEL
From Ledbroßum for the first time, there is a comprehensive plan of what the Zurich bike route network should look like.He figures in the municipal traffic plan, which the city parliament discussed and adopted on Friday.The debate had started on Wednesday;
At that time, the city parliament had made important decisions and, among other things, buried the historical parking compromise in the city center and stated that speed 30 should generally apply on municipal streets.But the bike route, which was on Friday, was the most important concern of the left parties.It is therefore foreseeable that it will be the topic in the rolling election campaign for the renewal elections in spring 2022.
Nobody in the city parliament seriously argued against the goal of a bike route network.This is also not surprising in view of the significant assumption of the SP's Velorouute initiative last autumn.Another question is whether the plan is included in the municipal structure plan and whether it is the task of a municipal council commission to prescribe the exact course of the routes.
The FDP found a “ghost discussion” no.She argued legally: the route plan had to be entered in the regional, not in the municipal structure plan.
The now published bike route plan is therefore not worth little.The Dominique Zygmont municipal council spoke of misleading the population: it is mistakenly suggested that the network would be created exactly as and quickly.
It was a "substantial ghost discussion". The spokesman for SP, AL, Greens and GLP did not agree.The entry in the execution plan finally brings Zurich "closer to the Velostadt", said Commission President Marco Denoth (Sp.).It is true that an entry in the regional structure plan is necessary.
But the city council is committed to promoting such an entry.Markus Knauss (Gp.) Said that "now you finally have a picture of how we imagine the network".The implementation will of course be crucial, but it was optimistic because a cultural change has taken place in the administration.
An “almost perfect” plandy of red-green dominated commission had postponed the treatment of the traffic position plan, among other things, because they wanted to record the bicycle network required in the SP initiative.For this, Stephan Iten (SVP.) In principle, showed understanding.But in the Commission this led to endless discussions about the route election, whereby each local council had given feedback from their own neighborhood.
That was not the mandate of the voters.The FDP councilor Cathrine Pauli spoke of microboragement-and pointed out that the direction of 50 kilometers required 110 instead of the 50 kilometers required in the SP initiative.Sven Sobernheim (GLP.) Defried: I had given important additions to the city council's proposal.
Among other things, Witikon is now connected to the Velonetz.The civil engineering head Richard Wolff (al.) Accused the FDP "Formalistist Hocus Pocus".He also defended himself against criticism of the detailed commission work.
The elaborate development of the Commission was exemplary: the city administration had presented a route plan that was "almost perfect".The municipal councils would have enriched this with local knowledge.
At the end you might deviate a little here and there, but in principle you will stick to it.Not only is the network plan new.It also states in the structure plan that bicycle lanes are consistently colored.
Furthermore, bike routes should not be created as it is today when a street is being renovated - but the administration can take action immediately to improve the bike frastructure.As expected, red-green prevailed in the vote.The same picture was shown in the vote over the entire traffic plan.
In addition to SP, Greens and AL, GLP and EPP also said yes, although they had not agreed in some points.Bicycle lanes should be colored consistently and not, as today, are not created when a street is renovated.Traffic policy has some blind stain comments on page 23

Velo instead of car - on the left greens / / city of Zurich with a two -thirds majority, the municipal council has approved the municipal traffic plan.
From the perspective of the left -green parties, it creates the basis for a modern, fossil -free city traffic.The bourgeois people reject him as extreme and restrictive.The plan provides for speed 30 and over 50 kilometers of car -free bike routes.

Velodemo needs a permit / / Daniel Fritz Scheimmerhin.After thousands of bicycles have paralyzed the city of Zurich under the banner of the global critical mass movement for the second time within two months, the responsible security department reacts.
However, only verbal.The bicycle sun had reached a size that was "difficult" for the city, a spokesman to say to the NZZ.Tattascht actually caused the bicycle alwine on the hard bridge and elsewhere restrictions on cars, trams and buses.It may have been fun for the demonstrating bikers.
Less for all the people who were unnecessary in the traffic jam on Friday evenings.There were hup concerts and legendities.Thats of the security department under the green head Karin Rykart would now be asked.
But what concrete consequences the organized chaos will have for the future discontinuation of the Velodemo leaves it open.The activists are already calling for the next blow for the end of July.The organizers are only advised to obtain a permit this time.
In other demonstrations - such as the “March for the Labe” of opponents of abortion - the security department was much more resoluter.City councilor Rykart has to put up with the accusation of arbitrariness that the SVP has applied.Since the experience of the last two times at the latest, it should be a matter of course that the city ultimately insists on a permit for the Critical Mass.
In this way, a route and a schedule can be agreed to reduce the negative effects on other means of transport and increase security.If the organizers refuse, the city police have the means to take part in participants or to point away.The city should clearly convey that to you.
The fact that the Critical Mass is an organized action or rather "a spontaneous, large volume of traffic from Velos" is that the critical mass is currently being seriously puzzledhave moved significantly to the left again in the past few years.In 2006 the situation for the city council was clear;Even then, the Critical Mass (cm) rolled.
In the parliament, he clearly replied to a request from the alternative list: «As soon as the CM achieves such a large number of participants that a limitation of the other road users can be expected, it is easy to assume increased common use and therefore an obligation to grant."Therefore, it has to apply to future CM:" In any case, a permit must be obtained.»
But today the bicycle activists are obviously inviolable, morally superior and supported by the highest political waiting.They deliberately hide in the anonymous mass - in the Critical Mass.Nobody wants to stand up for the traffic chaos they produce.
As can be seen, there are definitely structures.Those responsible meet regularly, not only on various channels in the digital space, but also physically.The movement has a website and political goals to cycle, sloping teams with the parades, and instructions are given via loudspeakers.
In addition, the authorities have met and exchanged several times with representatives in the past.The Critical Mass should be allowed to demonstrate for its concerns.But it should stand by name and obtain a permit.

Is the implementation of the bike route initiative on this street?/ / Objections on the left and right fight a bike preference route.The left-green city council and the left-green parties want exactly the same thing: better bicycle paths in Zurich.
In principle, at least.When it becomes concrete, your ideas differ so much that the SP goes to court against the civil engineering office.The dispute is the Mühlebachstrasse in Seefeld.
One of those bicycle preferred routes is to be created here, which demands the bike route initiative.According to the initiative, the new bicycle roads must be “basically car -free”.Only journeys of resident and trade were allowed.
However, the civil engineering office does not want to restrict car traffic on Mühlebachstrasse so much and do without driving bans.People's will undermined?The SP and the Velolobby Association Pro Velo understand this as a refusal to implement the popular will.
So they made an objection.They fear that the administration's plans will further promote car traffic.On the preferred routes, all legal advantages fall, which enables more faster progress.
"Without countermeasures, they could also become attractive alternative routes for the car," says Stadtzürcher SP-Co President Oliver Heimgartner.The initiative concerns car -free bike routes, on which inexperienced cyclists could be carefree, says Yvonne Ehrensberger, Managing Director of Pro Velo.This does not necessarily need driving bans.
Obstacles or trend -setted single -arrangements were sufficient.The city council rejects the objection.This emerges from his recently fallen decision, which is available to this newspaper.
It already has little traffic on Mühlebachstrasse, he writes.In contrast to the bicycles, the car traveler brings a continuous advance, since speed 30 continues to apply.A “elaborate” driving ban is not necessary.
SP and Pro Velo are now moving the case on in front of the governor's office.So they want to make this type of implementation impossible from the start.The conflict over Mühlebachstrasse continues a long-lasting discussion between the left-green parties and the city council.
SP and GREEN throw deep belly chief Richard Wolff (AL) to make too little forward when expanding the Velonetz.The house owner and the trade association also defends the decision.You will probably move on too, says Nicole Barandun, President of the Stadtzürcher trade association and co-president
The middle canton of Zurich.The trade defends the 27 white and 105 blue parking spaces, which the city council plans to delete for the bike route.The shops, craftsmen and residents on the street are dependent on parking facilities.
The dismantling will cause “logistical problems and additional costs” and bring more search traffic.The Veloroute can also be implemented with less dismantling.The city council also considers these objections wrong.
Many parking spaces were a danger for bicycle travelers or blocked the sidewalk, he writes.There are also numerous parking spaces in the vicinity.The area is also very well developed due to public transport.
Craftsmen should also park their cars in the parking ban if all fields are occupied, the city council writes.Car -free or with many parking spaces?In the Seefeld, it could currently be sprinted at how the bike routes all over the city look like.

Of all things, the SP delays the construction of a bike preference route / / Daniel Fritzschees sounds absurd.The city of Zurich is planning a long bike preference route in the Seefeld district;
To do this, she wants to delete over 130 parking spaces - and of all things, the SP is against it.The same SP, which otherwise does not miss the opportunity in the city to put stones in the way and to promote the bike.But that is exactly what it boils down.
On Monday, the Social Democrats and the Pro Velo association announced that they want to move on to the governor's owner office together with residents with residents against the Velorouuten project on Mühlebachstrasse.Exceptions are permissible, the project will be delayed indefinitely.
This is confirmed by the responsible security department on request.Before that, the SP already covered similar projects on Basler and Scheuchzerstrasse with objections and objections.The reason for the unexpected interventions of the Velo lobby: The city's plans go too far.
SP and per bike argue with the folk will.A year ago, the city -grown -ups of the Velorouute initiative of associations and left -wing parties had approved with over 70 percent.The initiative stipulates that a bicycle route network with at least 50 kilometers is to be created in the city within ten years.
These routes are said to be "fundamentally free of motorized private transport", as the initiative text says.This is exactly what is not the case with the first planned routes, for example on Mühlebachstrasse.The SP writes: “Instead of freeing the bike routes from car transformer traffic, the civil engineering office and the traffic department also promote them.»
This is because the previous legal advance should be canceled on the routes.In addition to bike, cars also have “free travel”.A no-go for the SP;
The initiative of that time was not formulated at that time.In the text it was expressly stated that the city council may regulate exceptions - for example for residents or the trade.Basically, the city council on Mühlebachstrasse does not want to have an elaborate driving banners, he wants to know the "coexistence of road users".
The Tamedia newspapers quote from a decision by the city council, according to which there is already little traffic on the district road.In contrast to the bike, drivers bring little time savings, since speed 30 continues to apply.Therefore, in contrast to the SP, the city council judges that the attractiveness for cars is not significantly increased.
SVP and FDP have two fields of political opponents of the SP have little understanding of their argument.Severin Pflüger, President of the Urban Freihouses and Law, doubts that the Social Democrats will be successful with their complaint."The discretion of the city council on this question is very great," he says.
For him, the procedure is another example of the fact that the SP and Pro Velo "want to override the laws of physics".You cannot leave the street open for residents and suppliers, but you can close for all cars.There is certainly a majority for good transport connections for cyclists - it is one of them.
Pflüger, however, doubts that there is a majority for "that everything goes against the car" .SVP transport politician and city council candidate Stephan Iten speaks of "cheap election campaign" by the SP.The party only wanted to have maximum solutions, preferably a city without cars.According to Iten, bike accidents hardly decreased.
Many of them are self -inflicted.There is hardly any through traffic on Mühlebachstrasse anyway, since it is mainly a one -way street.Iten also criticizes the city's plans.
Simply for reasons other than the SP.He disrupt the more than 130 parking spaces that are to be deleted without replacement in Seefeld."If the population had been shown how many and whose parking spaces are affected, the Velorouute initiative would never have been accepted a year ago." In addition to the bike bobby, the commercial and home owners' association also had the city's original projectcontained the Mühlebachstrasse.

Spures reducing on the Schmiede Wiedikon / / Neuer Veloweg around ten years ago, the Schmiede Wiedikon was redesigned car -free.
But since then, the traffic routing for Velos has caused trouble - especially those areas that pedestrians have to share with bicycle.Last week the city has now launched plans with which it wants to fix some problem areas.Among other things, the civil engineering office wants to attach separate bike strips on the pedestrian islands of the intersection and cancel the mixing traffic on the sidewalk.
Cycling gives a separate bike path.Before the Migros branch, it flows into Zurlindenstrasse, which will in future be accessible with bicycles in both directions.For this purpose, a lane reduction between Bremgarten and Birmensdorferstrasse and the introduction of a one-way regime for car traffic are necessary.
The pedestrians also benefit significantly more Bäumeder in this way.And: The city wants to increase the trees from 12 to 28.Zurlindenstrasse also receives twelve new trees in the other direction.
As the city announced in May, this section of the road is expected to be redesigned from next summer, the sidewalk is widened and the bike paths expanded.At the same time, the city renovates the “Schmiede Wiedikon” bus stop and expands it without obstacle.The city council has already approved around CHF 1.2 million for the repair of the public transport stop, and CHF 483,000 for the first design measures on Zurlindenstrasse.

Even more rental bikes on the streets / / new bike rental system until the autumn 2022 are available at 350 bicycles at 350 stations of the Basel population.
Andrea Schuhmacher's competition is there: Over three years after Pick-E-Bike introduced the first bike loan system in Basel, the Intermobility company is now launching another offer: “Velospot Basel”.With 100 electrical and classic bicycles at forty stations in the large and Kleinbasler city center, the company from Biel is now in operation.
The canton of Basel-Stadt supports you with CHF 2.15 million from the commuter fund.As Esther Keller, head of the construction and traffic department, says on the media orientation of yesterday Wednesday, the number of vehicles will gradually grow.By autumn 2022, the population in Basel 2000 bicycles should be available at 350 stations.
Accordingly, the bike infrastructure in Basel is expanded.For example, additional parking spaces for the two -wheelers on Utengasse and on Rebgasse are to be built.“Velospot” receives its own locations marked with red color.
Spread beyond the city limits to the Basel bidders and nearby countries is already being considered.Wild growth among providers can assert themselves for trouble worries. The new provider can still show itself.
Pick-E-Bike, which is operated by Baselland Transport AG (BLT), Primeo Energie and Basel Kantonalbank, has had time to establish itself in the city for years and is used lively.This bicycle loan system is also supported by the canton: the Oberwil company receives the Oberwil company from the commuter fund for the years 2021 to 2023.The the canton still decided against the application of Picke-Bike to operate the new bike system, seems under theseCircumstances strange.
The wild growth among e-trottinet providers has regularly caused anger in Basel in recent years.In addition, compared to the well -known, the new bicycles only have to be picked up and deposited at specially intended stations.Esther Keller, even a good customer at Pick-E-Bike, understands «Velospot» as a supplement to the current offer.
"Pick-e-bike is certainly more attractive for longer distances," says Keller.However, “Velospot” is characterized by other advantages: the new bicycles can be used without a guide ID and from the age of 14.
Half of the vehicle fleet consists of classic bicycles, the other of slow e-bikes that only drive up to 25 kilometers per hour.A helmet is not necessary for the trip.However, it is questionable whether the bicycle system can ever be operated profitably.
According to François Kuons, CEO of Intermobility AG, which also includes “Velospot”, it is impossible to operate such a system profit -oriented.Only with the help of the public sector could prices be kept so deep for customers that they are also attractive.Nevertheless, according to the Keller, the offer is necessary to open up the “last mile” by public transport.
Around a third of the Basler do not have their own bike.If you count the approximately 114,000 commuters a day and the approximately 750,000 tourists per year, there is definitely a demand for the loan.The rent of a classic “Velospot” bike costs CHF 2.90 for the first 30 minutes.
For the e-bikes, CHF 3.80 are required for the first 15 minutes.With different subscriptions or buying your own battery, the rent becomes cheaper.to register

These Basel loanos are too complicated / / themselves to claw too unattractive CHF 2.15 million, the canton of Basel-Stadt is investing in the Velospot bike loan system.The first experiences with the app and the e-bike show:
Not everything runs smoothly yet.A test.Andrea Schuhmacherder
CEO of the Intermobility SA, which operates the Velospot bike loan system in Basel, must be called for help right after the first test.«No, you can't drive like that!“, Says François Kuonen on the phone.So back on the saddle.
In practice, the simple handling promised at the media orientation in September turns out to be not so easy in practice and anything but intuitive.The canton of Basel-Stadt Velospot supports CHF 2.15 million from the commuter fund.In the test, however, it quickly becomes clear: this system still has improvement potential.
The “regional journal” recently reported that the app was too complicated.We wanted to know that exactly.I stand up to the test and my experience confirms this.
First of all, I want to know: where can I find such a vehicle at all?But the card doesn't work on the app.I will find it on the website, but then provided the task of looking for the Basel Map.
The engine switches ABSO a lot of geography knowledge is still available from school and the goal is now clear: two Velospot-e-bikes are at Picassoplatz.In addition to the many private bicycles, the rental bikes look chunky, but at least it makes the bright red color visible from afar.
Now the app comes again.Payment works this time, the message "Invalid input" can be confidently ignored, because the access code has nevertheless arrived by email.The journey can finally start now.
It goes towards the train station.In the highest gear, after all, the engine helps, I flit through the streets and come to the first stop at Aeschenplatz.It is 5 p.m. and afternoon traffic clogged the intersection.
Finally, a gap - but it hardly goes forward.I have to get into the pedals strongly so that the engine recognizes: Hey, it starts again!
Go on !This is how the journey continues: every time if the pedals have to be stopped briefly or if the pedals are not actively moved, the engine switches off and the vehicle has to be tediously started again.
What is going wrong?"You have to drive in first or second gear," recommends the Intermobility CEO François Kuonen.With only very gentle cycling you can also reach the top speed without the engine constantly switching off.
The second attempt runs better accordingly - but good is different.The instinct to get into the pedals with strength is difficult to overcome.And the engine also likes to switch off again when cycling gently.
A little luck helps with the well-known dangerous bodies of the city: at the market hall crossing, the cyclist is granted the lead by the other road users.Salvely and completely, I make it through the tracks, roadway and tram stop on the bridge into the Gundeli.
I turn into the Güterstrasse and mive through cars, passers-by and tram tracks towards Peter-Merian-Bridge.I can only dream of bike -friendly tracks and an improvement in the situation for cyclists on the bridge.I have a mystery to see whether I can park the loan directly in front of the office at the Veloparkplatz.
It is not marked as a bicycle station, and only these bicycles should be deposited on them.Only - there is no mark on the parking lot at the Picassoplatz.To stay on the safe side, I quickly bring the bike back to its original place.
In the third year, clearly marked stations, a bumpy driving experience, IT problems with the app and website.This is the conclusion of my short self-test with the e-loan.The question remains:
Who uses this offer under such circumstances?After three weeks of operation, François Kuonen cannot give any representative figures.Some trips have been registered: from the train station, from drivers who live near the stations and park the bike again in the same place. "A system with stations also needs many of them to work," says Kuonen.
In Biel, the experience has been found that the system only worked really well in the third year.The start of the company in Basel in autumn was also explicitly selected to slowly let the system start so that the network can then start properly in spring."Otherwise it comes like with public - there is a puff." The fact that the Basel rental bikes like their counterparts from Zurich are stolen is currently not the case.
"We have few problems with it," said Kuonen.The Velospot bikes are not suitable for claws.«Everyone in the neighborhood would immediately know that the bike was stolen.»
You went tactically.Kuonen: "The loan velos should not be too attractive either." Heiels: The market hall crossing has its pitfalls for bike travelers.

Veloststrasse also increases the pace of cars / / municipal bike offensive with new bike streets, the city wants to liquefy bicycle traffic in the quarters.
The benefit is low for the federal government.It sees it differently per bike.Bernhard Ottvelostrassen are not only for Velos.
This became aware of everyone at the latest when, during the construction work on Breitenrainplatz, a large number of cars drove through the Beundenfeld and Military Strasse in the Bernese Nordquartier.At that time, the axis was less like a bike road than an alternative route for car driving.The traffic was denser than ever.
And sometimes there were small bicycles in front of the street due to oncoming vehicles.Bicycle roads differ from “normal” streets only by the right to go.They are Tempo 30 streets on which the legal advance for installing vehicles is canceled.
This enables all road users to drive through the neighborhood faster - including car travelers.The bike tempo on the axis mentioned in the northern district increased by 3 to an average of 26 km / h, as the evaluation of a pilot test by the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra) showed.The speed of the cars, on the other hand, rose from 29 to 35 km / h-and was therefore well above the Tempo 30 limit.
In the second Bern pilot section Erlachstrasse - Freiestrasse remained constant at an average of 24 or 32 km / h for bicycles or cars.Astra is
The city wants to supplement the existing two bike roads with six more in other parts of the city.Because the previous experiences with bike streets are positive, as stated in a message.This applies to the majority of the bike, as a Pro Velo survey showed last year.
But from the perspective of the Federal Office of Streets, the pilot test in various Swiss cities is through."Overall, no benefits of the bike breeds for bicycle funding, bicycle comfort or bike security can be clearly demonstrated", the experts stated in the evaluation of the pilot test.In individual projects, however, there are “indications of a benefit”. Departure of the little enthusiastic campaign of the Astra sees Pro Velo Bern, however, a great benefit in Velostrassen.
"Mispower has to interrupt their journey less often," says Thomas Schneeberger, representative for bicycle measures.Therefore, the routes are "ideal to get to the goal more securely and faster". It needs more controlpro Velo for an expansion of the bike road network.In principle, however, it is clear that bike roads through the neighborhood were a supplement and no replacement for the expansion of the bike paths on the main traffic axes, says Pro Velo President Michael Sutter.
Transport expert Rolf Steiner also emphasizes that primarily the main traffic axes for bicycle traffic would have to be made more attractive and safer.In this regard, the city had done a lot recently - such as in the area of the rifle mat, on the Lorrainebrücke or on the Nordring.Steiner sees the bike roads as alternative opportunities for main traffic axes with many stops and lots of car traffic.
For example, bike travelers could bypass the Rodtmattstrasse in the Breitenrain, the Laupenstrasse or the Longassstrasse in an elegant way.When determining new bike roads, however, care must be taken to ensure that traffic -calmed quarters are not cut in two.In addition, structural measures or increased controls are needed to control compliance with Tempo 30.
"Cars and e-bikes are not allowed to board the quarters at 40 km / h," says Rolf Steiner.The expansion of a bicycle rail network is attractive to the city limits.However, the quarters could not laid bicycle iron that allowed a high pace.
"In the city, compromises are necessary - in the interest of all road users and especially the pedestrian," says Steiner.In the future, not only bicycles will not be reserved in the future.Their purpose is to achieve improvements in bicycle traffic without excluding car traffic, says urban traffic planner Karl Vogel.
The federal government chose this "reduced execution".The city must work with the legal bases.However, she is committed to upgrading Veloststrasse as part of her possibilities, says Vogel.
In the six newly planned bicycle roads, more space would be created by reducing or a new arrangement of parking spaces - as was the case with Beundenfeldstrasse, for example.The “actually slightly increased speeds of car traffic” there are undesirable.However, they are still "in the tolerance area," says Vogel.
The Plafond in the city of Bern has not yet been reached with a total of eight bike streets.Vogel considers the planning of other routes conceivable.“A comprehensive use” is not intended.
A Velostrasse is a "targeted measure" to enable bicycle travelers to avoid main axes with a lot of traffic, says Vogel.Velostrassen in the city of Bern «Velostrassen are ideal for getting more and faster at the destination.» Thomas Schneeberger representative for bike measures per Velo Bernvelostrassen and Velohauptroutein of the city of Bern is differentiated between Velohauprouten and Velostrassen.
Velohaup routes are at least 2.5 meters wide bike strips from main traffic axes.They form the backbone of the urban bike route network.Bicycle breeds, on the other hand, are quarters at 30 speeds, where bicycle travelers and other vehicles have progressed in front of the bending vehicles.

With the expert through the city / / evaluation of the bike paths, Zurich is really that bad for bicycle travelers?The Dutch traffic planner Ruben Loendersloot shows what is going wrong here and what is going right here.
Beat Metzler the greeting is rough.As soon as Ruben Loendersloot has risen to the bike in Zurich, he is attached and almost touched by a car.
Loendersloot works as an independent traffic planner, specializing in bike solutions.Cities from all over Europe get the President of Dutch Cycling Embassy if they no longer know how to keep knowing.Last week the Dutch was in Zurich.
He advised urban bike experts, discussed SP politicians and with this newspaper turned a test round through the city center.His first impression: «The street space is very one -sidedly distributed to the cars.Many drivers are unnecessarily fast and behave as if the street belongs alone. »The gesture almost works
Loendersloot can be felt lovingly on the Talstrasse, for example.It is considered a bike route, but the bike strip breaks off at the height of the old botanical garden.To the lake, bicycles remain trapped between parked and overtaking cars.
Anyone could open the car door at any time.Too dangerous, says Loendersloot.So he directs the borrowed e-bike into the middle of the trail.
The car chips behind him.Loendersloot stays in the middle, unmoved.When the car has space to overtake and accelerates past it, the Dutch waves.
The gesture looks in a good mood, almost loving. "As a cyclist, you sometimes have to spread," says Loendersloot in almost perfect German.Inexperienced drivers, children or older people should not be expected of bottlenecks like on Talstrasse.Loendersloot brakes on the Bürkliplatz to take cell phone pictures.
«What a lake!What a great city!»Traffic planners also have tourist reflexes.
Another Zurich sight is waiting on the Quai bridge: one of the few bicycle tracks separated with curbs.This increases the feeling of security, Loendersloot praises.Only the trail doesn't bring that much because it ends up in a pedestrian zone at the Bellevue. "That was intensely" continues along the seamstream.
Velomarkation is missing for single-tracks in the Bellevue Group, it only begins later.A car accelerates close to Loendersloot, apparently annoyed by its presence. "That was intense," says Loendersloot when he reached Limmatquai.For the only time during the one and a half hour exit, he looks worried.
Loendersloot knows the main argument against more bike paths: no space.But that often just doesn't voice.There is no end to the Bellevue or on the hard bridge, only it belongs to the cars.
«Sometimes there is no other way than to adapt the planning of the 1960s and 1970s.“Loendersloot means that painting cars.
The traffic is based on the offer, he says.If the Quai bridge were to be widened on three traces, there would soon be traffic jam again.Conversely, the number of cars shrinks when you get the streets.
"Many of these trips can also be carried out by bike or in the tram." Loendersloot emphasizes that parking spaces no longer disturb him on this sunny autumn afternoon that he is not a "bike talist".On the contrary .Certain car brands inspire him, car infrastructure buildings à la Hardbrücke make him enthusiastic, almost like Lake Zurich.
It would be wrong to banish the car from the cities.This attitude is shown at the beginning of the tour when Loendersloot drives through the Kanzleistrasse from Bulllingerplatz.In the future, a bike preference route should lead here.
This is determined by the execution plan, which the city -grown -ups vote at the end of November.The cars are lined up almost continuously on both sides of the street.The parking spaces do not disturb Loendersloot - in contrast to many Zurich bike politicians.
"I think it's okay if residents can park their cars." On the other hand, it is important that the through traffic of velor routes can be kept away.And the signaling must make it clear to the drivers "that they are not the bosses here".Therefore, almost all bicycles in Holland have a red surface.
«Thanks to such red carpets, as we call them, bicycles feel welcome.“The city of Zurich has not yet decided whether it will color the bike routes across the board.The clarifications for this are going, according to the responsible service department.
Deep pace and consideration of the home have already run many of the street distribution fights.Even the conservative Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte Kurvt today with the bike through Amsterdam.Thanks to the popularity of the bike, most car travelers also know how to sit on a bike.
"This shapes traffic culture," says Loendersloot.In the meantime, Dutch cities do without red lights or other signals at some intersections."The so -called 'shared zones' work because the pace is low and all consideration takes each other." Later Loendersloot says that Zurich is on a promising path when it comes to bike.
He observed numerous good approaches.He describes the planned preferred routes on side streets as a "optimal solution". The gruff greeting has obviously forgiven the city.Ruben Loendersloot on the Bürkliplatz: «The street area is very one -sidedly distributed to the cars.»

If necessary, VCS would like to enforce with expropriations / / commuting with the bike What use the plans for Velopendler routes if nobody implements them?
The VCS demands that the canton go ahead - and, if necessary, take rigorous measures.Bernhard Ottalle are for the bike.At least on paper: The bike article in the Federal Constitution obliges the cantons to ensure a bicycle path network.
The canton of Bern strives to “equality for bike traffic with the other types of traffic”, as it says on the website of the traffic directorate.And the Bern-Mittelland regional conference recently presented the so-called corridor studies.They show how bike -ups will in future get to the outskirts on new routes in five corridors.
Canton is to be feared that it may take forever to take forever until bike in the Bern area and if possible without an interruption.He also fears that the planned Velohaup routes will become “patchwork carpets” because the street owners are different.The organization therefore calls for a faster procedure.
"The most important bicycle routes should be realized until four years," says VCS President Franziska Grossenbacher.With similar skills such as the federal government in the motorway construction, the canton could make the widening of bike strips faster at the expense of car traffic, says Grossenbacher.Großbacher does not rule out the opportunity to expropriate street or landing owners.
No money, no space for the corridor studies, most of the everyday routes are intended for bicycle on main lines.The owners of the streets are primarily responsible for corresponding signaling or structural measures - in most cases the municipalities.The requested takeover of these competencies by the canton of the Grand Council would have a decision, the cantonal construction and traffic directorate (BVD) records on request.
«Such a change would also have significant financial effects.»For the municipalities, the money is usually also scarce, as often as the traffic area on the main road - for example in the Worblental between Worb and Deisswil.The Worblental is not included in the corridor studies because there has been planned for a new everyday route for bicycle for almost five years.
The example shows an example of how long the implementation of the plans takes.Hickhack in the Worblentaldie Kantonsstrasse in the Worblental is “little attractive” for bicycle, as the regional conference from 2017 says.The traffic volume of an average of 12,200 cars per day (2015) is "very large".
In sections with cramped street cross -sections, bike strips are missing.Crossings at the roundabouts are “critical” for bicycle travelers. The responsible persons decided to plan a new everyday route in the middle of the Worblental - between the Kantononstrasse and the leisure bike from Switzerland on the other side of the valley.He can understand the criticism of the long periods of time, says the Eastern Mundy Mayor Thomas Iten, President of the Transport Commission of the Regional Conference.
«It takes a very long time from planning to the implementation of a Velor route.»However, legal provisions of water and flood protection would also have to be taken into account when planning the everyday velor route in the Worblental.A route along the Worble is not possible because bike routes along water should not be paved.
Ultimately, the construction of a route always depends on the financial participation of the affected communities.Iten compares the situation with planning and construction of the tram to Ostermundigen.“The first study dates from 2005, and no excavators have still been opened to this day.»
Bicycle routes are approved as part of street plans.According to the road law, expropriations would be possible.However, this only represents the Ultima Ratio, the BVD continues.
Regional conference representative Iten also does not believe in expropriations.The BVD, however, admits that the implementation of the everyday velor routes proposed in the corridor studies is only planned "after 2027".For federal subsidies from the current agglomeration program by 2027, only easily implementable measures would be considered.
For the CHF 2.8 million Route in the Worblental, it could at least partially be enough for federal money from the current agglomeration program.Although the preliminary project is only in the works and the participation is planned in the second half of 2022, a first part of the route should be realized "by 2026/2027 at the latest".New everyday life in the Worbentalungsmütliche situation between Vechigen and Worbboden.

There was no longer a license for Velo-Raser / / Andreas Engeles a bang shortly before Christmas: The Zurich city government announces that it will be on almost all streets in the city in the next few years with the exception of the main traffic axes.
Many other Swiss cities plan similar measures.The goal of the collective pace brake: less noise and thus more quality of life for the residents.For many drivers: while they are asked very quickly to the cash register at a speed crossing, bike drivers, including those with a fast 45 km / h e-bike, have a free letter for the lawn.
Because even if Velos basically have to adhere to the speed limit, they are only prosecuted in exceptional cases in the event of transitions - for example if they endanger or even violate other road users due to unpleasant speed.Fast e-bikes have to wear a yellow license plate that is registered with the road traffic office-however, the owners do not have to count on female speeds if they are flashed in a 30 zone.According to the law, bicycles and e-bikes do not need a speed meter, which is why their drivers cannot know exactly how quickly they are on the go.
But this gap in law will soon be over.The Federal Council passed a regulation in December, which will make the speedometer a mandatory at least for the fast e-bikes from April 1, 2024.If you already have such an e-bike, you have time to retrofit a speedometer by April 1, 2027.
The police could also ask the police to pay for the tank with the pace light if they rush too quickly through 20 or 30 zones.The legal adjustment should not primarily improve the state coffers, but rather ensure more security: the number of accidents with e-bikes has been increasing for years.
With a speedometer, e-bikers could better assess their own speed and adapt the pace to their own driving skills, according to the advocates.Another security measure comes into force much earlier: From April 1, 2022, all e-bikes-whether supported up to 25 or 45 km / h-must always be on the road with light during the day.
A speedometer will be a must for fast e-bikes up to 45 km / h from 2024.Tempolimits in city centers are increasingly being implemented.In the future, too fast e-bikers could also be asked to checkout.

Urban Velobe officer has to defend himself / / Zurich Dave Durner has been a Velobe representative of the city of Zurich, officially “project manager Velosicherkeit” since 2020.It goes without saying that you are committed to the bike.
However, Durner does not seem to clearly separate his new role from his former than private bike bbyist, as the NZZ reports.Instead, he seems to use his new insights to increase the external pressure on his new employer.Before moving to the city, Durner was managing director of Pro Velo Kanton Zurich for 20 years.
Last year he slid back into this role, as an SP-internal protocol shows that the NZZ is available.In July 2021, Durner was a guest at AG Velo, a sub -group of the Stadtzürcher Social Democrats.According to the protocol, he is said to have critically commented on his work environment: «In general, I perceive internal resistance in our department, not all work in the same direction.»
According to the protocol, he encouraged to legally proceed against insufficient urban bike projects: “Be sure to continue.Clear recommendation to move on to a rejected objection with a lawyer, provided that prospect of success. »Recurrently recurrent, the SP has repeatedly recurred against urban bike projects.
However, she did so before meeting Durner.The latter told NZZ that he can no longer remember the wording of the AG Velo.«I certainly said that I would understand when the SP made up.
I don't think I should have recommended it, »he is quoted.Durner's employer, the traffic department, makes it clear in the article that it is of course not a matter of motivating employees to raise an appeal against the city of Zurich ».According to his own statements, Durner did not do this either.

By 2050, 30 million francs each year for the expansion of the bike paths / / cantonal council against his will, the government council must give bike a higher priority to bike in road construction.
The long -term underpass was the most tedious bottleneck for the cyclists in Zurich.Some accepted detours so that they didn't have to go through there.In the meantime, the problem has been resolved, the bike tracks have been widened and expanded.
But in the Velonetz of the Canton of Zurich there are hundreds of other sections of the road, in which the cyclists are not protected from motorized traffic too little, from trucks and quick cars.There are a total of 1200 vulnerabilities - at 700 of them and there are no infrastructure for cyclists on 200 traffic nodes: there are no bike paths, no extra tracks, no protective signalations.
District Council feared financial problems as early as 2018 when he answered a question from parliament.He estimates the costs of changing this at up to CHF 900 million.
Yesterday, now he has caught the binding order on the cantonal council to fix the weaknesses until 2050.He should reserve CHF 30 million every year and create a corresponding construction program.The government council has in vain.
The problems are recognized.But the devil is often in the details of each individual road construction project, he writes about the motion of GLP cantonal councilor Sonja Gehrig (Urdorf).The requested money could not be spent on the demanding planning process in good time, and the bike funding program has already granted CHF 20 million annually.
The government also fears financial problems, because from now on 20 percent have to be paid to the municipalities from the road fund, in which the traffic taxes of the car drivers flow.This is total of around CHF 70 million every year.But the reservations and concerns did not stop the cantonal council from aging motion with 86:80 votes.
Sonja Gehrig also refused to convert the motion into a postulate.«We now have to get a patch.»There is a border of refusal to work if the government council pretends not to be able to fix the weaknesses at the required pace.
SVP, FDP and the middle were in vain.Ueli Pfister (SVP, EGG) recalled that maximum solutions for bike drivers were only possible if you restrict public transport.René Isler (SVP, Winterthur) reported as a passionate pedestrian:
"I don't feel like becoming a bumper between bikers and drivers in the city." For the middle, the advance is only an employment therapy for the administration.Alex Gantner (FDP, Maur) spoke of an "impatience priority" and conjunction: "We have already switched up a gear when the weak points are resolved.»
Now you have to let the government council work in peace.For Felix Hoesch (SP, Zurich), the opposite speeches all fell out of a windshield look.For Thomas Forrer (Greens, Erlenbach), the advance is politely formulated because he gives the government council for 30 years.
It should not be that bikers remain “living traffic obstacles” for longer in road traffic.Carmer Walker Späh warns of the anger of the driver government councilor Carmen Walker Späh (FDP) commented on as the "guardian of the street fund".It is necessary to think of all road users during the road construction planning.
If it continues with bike support, it may soon be the “lid” to the drivers. Shortly, the cantonal council has transferred another initiative for bike funding with 85 to 79 votes: The government council has to systematically systematically with the Velonetz plancompare .Daniel Schneebelidie bike -friendly converted long -road underpass in Zurich - elsewhere the cantonal council still sees a need for action.

The bike will once again become a political circle / / referendum against parking spaces in Bern, there is probably a vote on the bike station in wave 7 at the train station.SVP-related circles have the signatures for their referendum together.
Cedric Fröhlicht the situation with the parked bikes around the Bern train station is legendary.For example on the Schanzenstrasse above the wave, where one vehicle has been lined up for years.
A state that the city wants to defuse with another bike station: 660 additional parking spaces are to be created on the ground floor of the wave 7.The city would cost the city almost 2.4 million francs over the next three years.
Around 1.5 million of them would have to be paid as a sublease to Migros Aare, which in turn rents the area from Postfinance.The city council approved the corresponding loans in January with great more.Only the SVP and the middle rejected the business.
All of this prompted the municipal SVP and the SVP-related federal government of taxpayers to collect the signature.According to your own statements, you have now collected the 1500 signatures for a optional referendum at the urban level."We handed over around 1800 signatures to the city chancellery," says SVP city councilor Janosch Weyermann on request.
It is about the fundamental city of the federal city - once again - in front of traffic ideological fundamental debates.About the supposed unequal treatment of car and bike drivers, for example.
The city does not want to charge any fees for using the new bike station during the first 24 hours.This contradicts the cause principle that has just been trying to make parking cards more expensive for drivers, criticizes Weyermann."Before we discuss new parking spaces, the existing offer must first be used." There are currently around 4,700 parking spaces near the station, around 2000 of which are in four bike stations.
Not all of these stations are fully utilized.According to the urban traffic planner Karl Vogel, the latest figures still show: Bicycle traffic is increasing again compared to the previous year.
The pressure on the parking spaces around the train station is high, says Vogel."Around 10,000 places are necessary in the medium and long term." A question of the money-resistant referendum committee continues to complain about the construction of the planned deal:
The federal city has a deficit in front of them, saves here, raise dog tax, says Janosch Weyermann."At the same time, however, she is ready to pay an exorbitant rental price - and only to two large corporations." Municipal councilor Marieke Kruit justifies the amount: "The room for bike parking spaces around the train station is scarce.
It was important to take the opportunity to take the chance with the rent in wave 7."From the municipal council's point of view, the expenses are useful, portable and a good investment in" city -friendly mobility ". KRUIT also refers to the larger context:" A well -functioning train station is central to Bern.»This includes an attractive range of bike parking spaces.
The more commuters are traveling with the bike, the greater the relief of public space around the train station.The signatures submitted must still be certified by the city chancellery.It is open when the vote should come.

Velor route building eats more parking spaces than expected / / Michael von Ledebures simply does not go forward with the construction of new bicycle paths: This lawsuit has been heard in the city of Zurich for years.
But now it is quick for once.So far, four of the new bike routes in neighborhood streets have been known, around five meters wide highways, on which bicycles basically have progressed.Now six more have been added-almost half a year after the voters accepted the municipal traffic plan at the urn and one and a half years after the yes to the SP initiative for "safe bike routes".
The total ten new routes can be found in a presentation that the civil engineering office presented in the bike commission, a specialist group consisting of politicians and external experts.It is the NZZ.Above all, one knowledge is remarkable:
Much more parking spaces are sacrificed from bike routes than previously assumed.Quarters are severely affected to vote on the execution plan last autumn, no number had been communicated by the authorities.But both the FDP councilor Dominique Zygmont and the green Markus Knauss, at that time both members of the preparatory commission, had spoken independently of “several hundred parking spaces”.
The ten bike routes alone will lead to a reduction of 1500 parking spaces.They correspond to 30 kilometers of bicycle path.However, 130 kilometers are planned.
If you calculate this, the dismantling should be around four times as big.According to this estimate, over 6000 parking spaces would disappear, all in the quarters and most in the blue zone.In view of the total number of 68,000 publicly accessible parking spaces in the city area, this number is remarkable.
It is even more important if you put it in relation to the 33,000 parking spaces in the blue zone.Every sixth parking lot in the blue zone could therefore be eliminated.Civil politicians see this development critically, but also a little resigned.
The FDP councilor Andreas Egli says that there is “no stopping” parking with parking.This is already noticeable in the current road construction projects.The civil engineering office is no longer considerate of receiving parking spaces.
Of course, bike routes are based on a referendum, says Egli.«But we voted on bike routes and not about‹ Züri car -free '.»Unfortunately, extremism in traffic issues is increasingly giving up, not only in the city parliament, but also in the city council and administration.
The green municipal council Markus Knauss was also a change in the civil engineering office.He says: «I have never experienced such a coordinated effort as now on the bike routes in this city.»So far, the civil engineering office has only ever took individual projects.
«But now you have now understood what we want and gained a patch when implementing.»Obviously, the administration only waited for the outcome of the directional plan vote in order to take the almost finished projects out of the drawer.It is no reason to excitement that the parking reduction has a big man.
According to the cantonal planning and building law, parking spaces in the blue zone are only intended as a temporary solution.Accordingly, the parking spaces did not disappear, but would only be relocated to the underground garages of the homeowners.This will "commut" in the long term.
And as an effect, street space is released for other uses - primarily for bicycle paths and trees.The SVP councilor Stephan Iten does not convince this.In many quarters, it is simply not possible to shift parking spaces to the underground, for example with the planned bicycle routes in the Scheuchzer or Birchstrasse.
These buildings are older than the planning and building law.Iten believes that many voters underestimated the dismantling in the quarters when they said about the bike route initiative.«Almost everyone has agreed to the initiative because cycling is a likeable concern.
But nobody wants the parking spaces to disappear in front of their own house.»Andreas Egli points out that parking spaces in an underground car park are not open to the public and therefore cannot be compared to those in the blue zone.And he criticizes that the dismantling under the title is security without being defused with the bike routes particularly neuralgic points.
“On the other hand, the fear of cars is deliberately fueled and speaks of more quality of life thanks to bike routes.But is it so much higher when bicycles flit by the right and left of you? »Reflections have to be delayed.But this does not lead the cyclists to less kilometers per hour.
In the presentation, the civil engineering office explains how delicate intersections want to defuse with pedestrians: with pedestrian strips, warning boards, warning signals on the asphalt and a slight increase in the bike lane.The new routes are said to be almost five meters wide, wide enough that two cyclists can drive next to each other and cross from the opposite direction with a car or two cyclists.On quarters roads, the legal advance is lifted in favor of the route - but crosses the Veloroute a main road, the cyclists have to be behind the cars.
The routes will be fried on the left and right.In processing at the civil engineering office, a connection of the district 4 to the city center, from Schwamendingerplatz to the Stettbach city border or from Frankenalerstrasse to Hönggerstrasse are, among other things.The estimated 6000 parking spaces are not the only ones that will be lost in the coming years.
The historical parking compromise in the city center was lifted with the new structure plan - a compromise proposal from the city council was not grace.This provided for a maximum of 1500 parking spaces.In addition, there is again a systematic breakdown in the blue zone.
If there are replacement buildings, parking spaces in the blue zone are automatically painted according to the structure plan.And in the future, a residential parking card in the blue zone will only receive who can prove that they have no way of parking privately.Most of the ten known bicycle routes are likely to be advertised this year.
However, objections are likely to prevent them from being realized quickly.Against the first route in Seefeld, the SP obtained objection.The implementation is too car -friendly for her.
You could also say: too little radical.A first Velo Highway is to be built on Baslerstrasse-the city has already had a particularly wide Veloweg brush on the asphalt.Ennio Lanza / Keystone

Pro Velo means anti-car / / The city of Zurich is making the construction of bike highways.It is about five meters wide express roads that are so large that cars could also happen comfortably, but on which bicycles generally enjoy advance.
According to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, six more bicycle highways have been tacitly added since the passing of the new traffic position.Remarkable: significantly more parking spaces are sacrificed from bike routes than previously assumed.The intermediate calculation drives car nunks in the face.
The ten bike routes alone will lead to a reduction of 1500 parking spaces.They correspond to 30 kilometers of bicycle path.However, 130 kilometers are planned.
If you calculate this, the parking space reduction should be around four times as large - and thus include around 6000 parking spaces.In view of the total number of 68,000 publicly accessible parking spaces in the city area, this number is remarkable.It is even more important if you put it in relation to the 33,000 parking spaces in the blue zone.
Every sixth parking lot in the blue zone could be eliminated.Court politicians whiten the white flag whether the left superiority.The FDP councilor Andreas Egli says: «There is no longer any stopping in the city when removing the parking lot.»

The new Velohighways / / controversial bicycle roads This year the city of Zurich will set nine bike preference routes - it has already been leaked where they are supposed to carry out.
Up to 6000 parking spaces would be lifted.Beat Metzlerselten it happens that left -green transport politicians praise the urban civil engineering department.
However, the latest timetable for the implementation of the bike route initiative is encouraging even with hard critics.The bourgeois, on the other hand, see all of their fears confirmed.The bike promotion is full of the cars.
The civil engineering department plans to set nine new bicycle preferences until autumn.According to the initiative, four bikes must have space on them.Bicycle travelers mostly have ahead.
Only resident and the trade can still use such streets by car.The nine bike routes have a total length of around 27 kilometers.They should give way to about 1300 parking spaces, most of them in the blue zone.
In many affected streets, the city will also prescribe driving bans or by -the -art beams.This emerges from documents that the civil engineering department of the municipal bicycle commission presented, a specialist group of politicians.The NZZ was the first to report on the document.
Hardly surprising these nine routes are: 1.From the Altstetterstrasse to Stauffacherstrasse: 2.5 kilometers, 37 lifted parking fields.This route is already partly on Baslerstrasse. 2.
From Stauffacherstrasse to the Kasernenstrasse: 1.4 kilometers, 103 lifted parking fields. 3.From Bulllingerplatz to Morgartenstrasse: 1.7 kilometers, 123 lifted parking spaces. 4.From Herdernstrasse to the latter: 2.7 kilometers, 104 lifted parking spaces. 5.
From Oerlikon train station to Forchstrasse: around 7.1 kilometers, 368 parked parking fields. 6.From Affoltern train station to Oerlikonerstrasse: 3.5 kilometers, 157 lifted parking spaces. 7.
From Frankenalerstrasse to the Sydefädeli: 3.8 kilometers, 219 lifted parking fields. 8.From Kilchbergstrasse to Tannenrauchstrasse: 2.2 kilometers, 91 lifted parking spaces. 9.Stettbach city border (Altwiesenstrasse) to Schwamendingerplatz: 1.75 kilometers, 132 lifted parking fields.
The lines are hardly surprising.The left -green majority in the municipal council set them in the traffic plan.The voting population agreed with a good 57 percent last November last November.
Observers surprises the pace at which the civil engineering department drives the planning."I have never experienced such a commitment," says local councilor Markus Knauss (Greens).Also the consultation with the traffic department to work well.
"This is very gratifying." The bourgeois people are bothered by the number of lifted parking spaces.Upgrading - both sides agree - would disappear about 6000 parking spaces after the implementation of all preferred routes entered in the structure plan - around ten percent of the publicly accessible parking fields in the city.From the perspective of the bourgeois, this would not be necessary.
"The city is planning according to the maximum standard," says FDP councilor Andreas Egli.Safe bicycle preference routes could be implemented with significantly more parking spaces on the edge of the streets.Apparently the civil engineering office is also concerned with making driving in the city more difficult, says Egli.
"This is car -free through the back door." Markus Knauss points out that parking spaces in the blue zone are only considered to be a temporary solution according to the cantonal planning and building law."In the long term, they have to be moved to private underground car parks anyway." Courts have replied the last words of words Egli that such a shift in many places is not possible, for example in Höngg, where it himself lives.«Here it would need a massive, completely unrealistic new building.»
If the city prevails, it will no longer be possible for many in Höngg to own a car.Until then, years will probably be passed.Even if the city will soon advertise the nine preferred routes, its implementation remains uncertain.
Most projects probably have to do at least one round in court.This can be seen on the preferred route through Mühlebachstrasse in Seefeld, which the city advertised in January 2021.There are objections from both sides here.
SP and per bike complain that too much through traffic remains.Resident and members of the trade association want to preserve more parking spaces.All recurs have been at the governor's office for over six months.
Markus Knauss expects that some recuries are drawn up to the federal court, especially at the beginning.However, he appreciates the legal opportunities for parking on the preferred routes as good.«We created solid legal foundations in the execution plan.»
Andreas Egli doubts that.Parking is mandatory for a functioning car traffic.In May Simone Brander (SP) takes over the civil engineering department.
She promised to implement the bike route initiative by 2030.Whether she succeeds is the pace of the dishes.The first bicycle preferences of the city of Zurichso could be marked by the marking of a bicycle preference route.

Veloleichen - From to Africa / / Veloparknot in Bern Schrottvelos clog the rare parking spaces.Now the aid organization Velafrica collects you on behalf of property management.
Lina Stalderin Bern is driven as hard as ever.There are currently around 55 percent more two -wheelers in the city than in 2014.
To a large extent, this bike upturn is probably due to the improved infrastructure in the city.But bicycle traffic has also increased in rural areas, although not quite as strong.The rapid increase in bicycle traffic is desirable for environmental reasons, but now exacerbates the parking problem with the two -wheelers.
Spring cleaning For the good purpose of ownership and rental apartments, there are space problems in many places on the shared bike parking spaces.Especially now in spring.That is why unused bicycles are now on the collar: home owners' association, tenant associations and tenant associations and Pro Velo Bern clash in remarkable unity and clear out private parking spaces in a campaign.
Velafrica, an aid organization, is responsible for collecting the bicycles that makes disused bicycles in Switzerland again and sends them to Africa.The house owner association communicated the campaign to the members a few weeks ago via the HEV magazine.The concept seems to arrive.
"In the first four days after the announcement of the project alone, ten property administrations at Velafrica registered for a bike clearance," says Velafrica employee Mats Gurtner.Hard-fought parking cedar Time for the Muing campaign is not a coincidence."In winter there are many bicycles in the private cellar compartment because they are not used," says Edith Siegenthaler, President of the Cantonal Tenant Association.
“In summer, however, bike travelers would like to put their bike at a bike parking space where it can be used quickly and easily.»And these are mostly the bike parking spaces made available by the property management.But because more people drive bike on average, the parking spaces, which are often very limited anyway, are quickly exhausted.
In addition, by changing tenants or when the children take off, even bicycles remain.Matthias Wenger, President of the Jordi properties, confirms: «It is regularly criticized that on the one hand there are too few parking spaces or actually would have enough of it, but are blocked by unused vehicles.»Also with Dr.Meyer Immobilien is known - but especially for older houses.
Managing Director Marc Balsiger: "With newer properties, there is enough parking space from the start if possible." So now one has to fear that your own bike will fall victim to the MuSt campaign in the next few weeks?No .The tenant or apartment ownership is informed in detail in advance.
Then colored labels are glued to the bike, which can be removed within eight weeks.After this period, Velafrica only collects those who are still marked.Car parking spaces have to affect Softza's space problem not only private parking spaces, but entire residential quarters.
This shows a comprehensive survey by the city of Bern.Velos are often placed on the sidewalk because there are no parking spaces.In particular, cargo bikes and bicycles with supporters hinder foot traffic.
In May 2021, the municipal council reacted and spoke CHF 290,000 for additional public bike spaces in the quarters.So far, new parking spaces have already emerged on twelve streets - especially at the expense of existing car parking spaces.The lack of parking space around the main train station is most visible.
According to the city of Bern, the approximately 4500 available parking spaces are overcrowded in many places - with the exception of the 2000 paid places in the four bike stations.Part of the problem is also forgotten bicycles here.The fact that in Bern in addition to the east side of the main train station there is currently no time restriction, it makes it particularly easy for eternal parkers according to the cantonal police.

Velos are not significant in terms of quantity: only 7 percent of the respondents stated that they left their bike for more than 24 hours.Occasional mismatic actions have not to counter the precarious parking space situation around the train station.
The city presents the current situation to relieve the current situation that needs to be solved urgently.Because in the long term, you expect around 10,000 bike parking spaces around the train station in the long term.It is therefore a concern of the city that Velos will be increasingly parked in the stations in the future.
On the one hand, new bike stations are needed, and on the other hand, their offer must be made more attractive.This is the solution of the specialist office for foot and bike traffic.The city council gave the green light last January for another bike station in the Welle7 with 660 seats.
Cost: CHF 1.5 million.At the same time, a 24-hour grate parking is to be tested in the new bike station and in the post Parc.At the same time, another pilot test is planned in the Hirschengraben-Thanzensbrücke area, where a restriction of the storage duration is to prevent eternally parked bicycles.
A few weeks ago, however, the SVP successfully took the referendum against the project - it was too expensive.This can hardly be dangerous for the planned bike station, but contributes to a delay in implementation.The aid organization Velafrica collects 40,000 disused bicycles for Africa every year - also from private parking spaces.

Veloleichen - About Africa / / Bicycle Parknot in Bern Schrottvelos clog the rare parking spaces.Now the aid organization Velafrica collects you on behalf of property management.
Lina Stalderin Bern is driven as hard as ever.There are currently around 55 percent more two -wheelers in the city than in 2014.
To a large extent, this bike upturn is probably due to the improved infrastructure in the city.But bicycle traffic has also increased in rural areas, although not quite as strong.The rapid increase in bicycle traffic is desirable for environmental reasons, but now exacerbates the parking problem with the two -wheelers.
Spring cleaning For the good purpose of ownership and rental apartments, there are space problems in many places on the shared bike parking spaces.Especially now in spring.That is why unused bicycles are now on the collar: home owners' association, tenant associations and tenant associations and Pro Velo Bern clash in remarkable unity and clear out private parking spaces in a campaign.
Velafrica, an aid organization, is responsible for collecting the bicycles that makes disused bicycles in Switzerland again and sends them to Africa.The house owner association communicated the campaign to the members a few weeks ago via the HEV magazine.The concept seems to arrive.
"In the first four days after the announcement of the project alone, ten property administrations at Velafrica registered for a bike clearance," says Velafrica employee Mats Gurtner.Hard -fought parking cedar Time for the exposure campaign is no coincidence."In winter there are many bicycles in the private cellar compartment because they are not used," says Edith Siegenthaler, President of the Cantonal Tenant Association.
“In summer, however, bike travelers would like to put their bike at a bike parking space where it can be used quickly and easily.»And these are mostly the bicycle parking spaces made available by the property management.But because more people drive bike on average, the parking spaces, which are often very limited anyway, are quickly exhausted.
In addition, by changing tenants or when the children take off, even bicycles remain.Matthias Wenger, President of the Jordi properties, confirms: «It is regularly criticized that on the one hand there are too few parking spaces or actually would have enough of it, but are blocked by unused vehicles.»Also with Dr.Meyer Immobilien is known - but especially for older houses.
Managing Director Marc Balsiger: "With newer properties, there is enough parking space as possible today." So now one has to fear that your own bike will fall victim to in the next few weeks?No .The tenant or apartment ownership is informed in detail in advance.
Then colored labels are glued to the bike, which can be removed within eight weeks.After this period, Velafrica only collects those who are still marked.Car parking spaces have to affect Softza's space problem not only private parking spaces, but entire residential quarters.
This shows a comprehensive survey by the city of Bern.Velos are often placed on the sidewalk because there are no parking spaces.In particular, cargo bikes and bicycles with supporters hinder foot traffic.
In May 2021, the municipal council reacted and spoke CHF 290,000 for additional public bike spaces in the quarters.So far, new parking spaces have already emerged on twelve streets - especially at the expense of existing car parking spaces.The lack of parking space around the main train station is most visible.
According to the city of Bern, the approximately 4500 available parking spaces are overcrowded in many places - with the exception of the 2000 paid places in the four bike stations.Part of the problem is also forgotten bicycles here.The fact that in Bern in addition to the east side of the main train station there is currently no time restriction, it makes it particularly easy for eternal parkers according to the cantonal police.

Burgdorf and Köniz are not more bike -friendly than Bern / / Velohaupt Capital
Bern is the Swiss Velo capital, but Burgdorf.In the Velo ranking of Pro Velo Switzerland, Bern ends up ninth-behind Köniz, the place seventh.But what do Köniz and Burgdorf ahead of the self -proclaimed Velo head Bern?
The answer is simple: in smaller cities, people on the bike feel safer.There is generally less traffic.
In Bern, the tram rails also provide a lot of uncertainty.Burgdorf also receives the fruits of years of bike policy.While the bike travelers in Bern complain about ruthless drivers, potholes and too few parking spaces, Burgdorf they give better grading in all partial aspects.

Bern is not the most bike -friendly city / / to Burgdorf and Köniz compared to bike friendliness, Bern only takes ninth place - to Köniz and the actual Velo main city of Burgdorf.
Naomi Jonesseit seven years wants to become Bern Velo capital in Switzerland, and in the ranking of Pro Velo Switzerland, the city made it into the top ten of 45 communities with ninth place.
But Burgdorf is and remains.Even Köniz is in front of Bern with seventh place.Biel, Thun and Langenthal have not reached the necessary minimum of reviews to appear in the ranking.
What is missing in Bern?According to the Pro Velo survey, Bern cuts comfort and security particularly badly.A lot is currently being built in the city, for example in the Burgernziel, in the Breitenrain and around the train station.
For bicycle travelers there is either little space there, or they have to share the narrow path across the construction site with pedestrians, pedestrians.The quality of the streets has become worse.Potholes on the bike track are not uncommon, which increases the risk of accidents.
With a grade of 3.7, the comfort for Bern's bicycle is clearly insufficient.The traffic climate has improved slightly, but is only enough with a grade of 4.1.The consideration of the car travelers leaves something to be desired to drive past a standing column on the right is often not possible.
Above all, car travelers overtake too little distance.In general, security has received grade 3.8.What makes Köniz better?
The city's neighboring community cuts much better than Bern, especially when it comes to parking spaces, and 0.5 points.The traffic climate, the comfort on the streets and security are also slightly better.In Köniz, only the aspect of comfort with a grade of 3.9 is almost insufficient.
In Bern, in addition to the aspects of security and comfort, it is also the situation of the parking spaces.Köniz has done an effort here, says Pro Velo Bern, Dominik Guggisberg.For example, the municipality had planned the public bike parking spaces based on surveys based on needs.
However, he only partially justifies the comparison with the city.«Bern needs 10,000 parking spaces in the train station alone.In Köniz you only need a fraction of it, »he says.
This is also because many Könizers work in Bern and thus turn off their bike there during the day.Why Burgdorf?The Burgdorfer and Burgdorf women best judge their city for cycling.
With a grade of 4.7, the traffic climate and the safety of the bike travelers are best there.The network of bicycle paths and the situation with the parking spaces are almost good with a grade of 4.9.There are only potholes in Burgdorf, which does a slight demolition of comfort.
What does Burgdorf do so much better than everyone else?Burgdorf started promoting bike in the 1990s, explains Anita Wenger, who carried out the ranking for Pro Velo Switzerland.The whole city center is a stroller zone in which the cars drive slowly and have the pedestrians ahead.
There is a ring around the city that is often only for pedestrians.According to Wenger, the car travelers overtake from the perspective of the bike with more distance, leave more space in front of traffic lights so that bicycle travelers can start, and are generally more patient than in other cities.What can you compare?
Actually, Bern, Köniz and Burgdorf cannot really be compared.Bern is a big city.Köniz is considered a medium -sized city, but is largely a rural community that consists of different villages and districts.
And Burgdorf is a small town."It is not astonishing that bike travelers often feel more comfortable in small cities," says Wenger.It generally has less traffic there and usually no tram rails.
Overall, Bern has improved its average grade from 3.9 to 4.1.The city receives the best grade for its network of paths.The destinations in Bern can therefore be reached quickly and directly, there are bicycle-friendly main and suitable side axles, and the one-way streets are open to bicycle travelers.
What can Bern do?The SP City Councilor and Velopolitician Michael Sutter has a clear opinion in this regard: "In order to become Velo capital, Bern must continue to prioritize bike funding," he says.
That has subsided a bit lately.The responsible councilor Marieke Kruit (SP) does not want to know anything about that."For us, bike funding remains a central measure for us, because bicycle traffic is climate -friendly and compatible with the city," she countered.
Bern has increased compared to the last ranking and was the big city rated on the second best to Winterthur.In addition, bike funding is the highest importance compared to the other large cities in Bern.But Kruit admits: "We are not yet at our destination." Corona has awarded the bike Schub.

Velo ban without chance / / old town despite one-sided driving ban, bicycles and e-trottinette in the old town of Bern drive through Marktgasse.
The result is conflicts between pedestrians and the unauthorized road users.While the pedestrian lobby criticizes a lack of controls on the part of the cantonal police, Pro Velo Bern calls for an unrestricted driving license for bike in the old town.The current regulation lacks any logical basis.
The management for civil engineering, traffic and city green has already checked the situation two years ago, but has not found a better solution to restore peace between road users.If you drive on banned terrain, you can actually expect a bus of CHF 30 in Bern.But too often the situation for the law enforcement officers remains unclear.

The municipal public transport is under pressure / / mvl.·
The bike is on the upper in the cities.This is celebrated by the bike bby as progress, which also benefits the climate.This message questions Guido Schoch, former director of the Zurich Verkehrsbetriebe and today board member of Pro Bahn.
The expansion of the transport infrastructure is at the expense of public transport, he criticizes.And this is the only one to be able to transport people on a large scale all year round.The climate goals are simply unreachable without public transport.
But unfortunately the tendency is going in the opposite direction.The effects of speed 30 on public transport have been discussed broadly.Guido Schoch considers a different tendency to be more dangerous:
More and more traces would be dismantled in the city of Zurich so that space for bike paths would be created.Schoch speaks of around two dozen track elevations that have already been realized or planned.Without separate traces, speed 30 has a stronger effect on public transport.
The result will be a quality reduction.The establishment of bike paths on neighborhood roads does not interfere - but the persistence of the bike bobby on bike axes on main traffic axes.Schoch also has a sharp criticism of the recently presented master plan HB / Central for 2050.
Not only, as previously discussed, for car traffic, but also for public transport, the consequences would be drastically drastically, he says.The plans amounted to a clear breakdown, and the tram guide was extremely prone to interference.As so often in Zurich, the focus of the planners is aimed at quality of stay and the like - the public transport is forgotten.

The bike route creates resistance / / Michael von Ledeburdie Stadtzürcher women and city center have said to velorouten.But now that the implementation is about, many of them defend themselves.
Almost when the civil engineering office is planning to implement in the quarters, there is resistance.Estimated 6000 parking spaces in the blue zone are to be canceled on the entire city area.However, the city has not yet come across as much aversion as the currently time.
In Höngg alone, 350 private individuals and traders fight the bike preferential routes.But there are also objections along the route in Affoltern and Oerlikon (67) and in Schwamendingen (28).In June, the city of Zurich advertised the implementation of three routes.
A total of 496 parking spaces on the blue zone are to be lifted along the routes without replacement.Traffic regulations and markings as well as structural interventions should increase the security for the bike, according to the civil engineering office.This includes speed 30, right of way and a green, 40 centimeter wide ribbon on the roadside, which makes the bike preference route visible.
The resistance is no coincidence.He organized the Zurich trade association (GVZ), the homeowner association (HEV) as well as the FDP and the SVP.You called for objections.
Nicole Barandun, the President of the GVZ, emphasized that a lot of people would have raised objections who did not choose bourgeois.The two associations also raised the civil engineering office and submitted a desire to re -judgment at the Zurich City Council.The HEV managing director and FDP councilor Albert Leiser emphasizes that it is not about preventing the bike route, but for better solutions, because the current proposal amounts to a clear cut.
Depending on the road section, all or over half of the parking spaces in the blue zone should be lifted for the implementation.Residents and businesses would no longer find parking spaces for themselves and for their visitors.Do not write their own parking places in a message: «The people affected are dependent on these parking spaces, since there are no parking spaces on a large part of the tanned land and for legal reasons no parking spaces can be built.»
The HEV President Leiser says that in theory, the red-green city council's calculation may be up-that parking spaces should increasingly be moved from the blue zone to private parking garages.But in practice it shows that this is simply not possible in many quarters.In the response certificate it says literally that people are actually forced to sell their vehicles.
That is not proportionate.The massive parking reduction will lead to increased search traffic in the quarters, which will also affect the surrounding parking spaces.There is already a shortage of parking space today.
The demand to the city: It is intended to revise the three projects again so that parking in the blue zone is limited to a minimum.The civil engineering office can point out that the voters have significantly accepted the construction of bike routes on the urn, and this several times: first with the Velorouute initiative of the SP and then with the consent to the new traffic management plan last autumn."Most voters should not have read the small print," says Nicole Barandun, only half in joke.
She heard the same about the people who made an objection again and again: they were voted for the bike routes and were also for implementation, but against dismantling to this extent.Barandun speaks of many unnecessary deletions.
Often the only reason is fear of accidents when automotiveists just opened the autoure when a cyclist passes through.An argument that Barandun does not illuminate.«On a neighborhood road you usually drive on the middle of the road at the bike.»
Barandun, as GVZ President, has the situation of the traders, especially in the eye.The question of where a craftsman should park with an order along a Veloroute is unclear - possibly on the bike route.Are the objections not doomed from the outset-especially since red-green has recently been uncompromising in bike issues?
Barandun says that in some places there is certainly a legal handling.The minimum claim is an eye -up with the civil engineering office.In individual cases, this can already result in an improvement.
Overall, she hopes for an effect through the large number of dissatisfied that cannot simply be ignored - on a look at "that it does not work".There are significantly more people affected than just those over 400 who would have made an objection.Because only a very small circle is eloquent.
One of the objections has special explosiveness.The planned route of route concerns the Chilbi in Schwamendingen, the most important social event in the city district.The FDP is planning a request in the city parliament because the route threatens to carry out the Chilbi.
At the civil engineering office, however, one waves off: Like all streets, bike routes could also be blocked for a festival, and a bypass route for the cyclists is then signposted."We don't see the implementation of the Chilbi Schwamendingen endangered," says the office.
But it's not that easy.Roger Tognella is one of 28 people who have submitted an objection to the route in Schwamendingen.Tognella is old FDP council and co-organizer of the Schwamendinger Chilbi.
He names two problems.At one point, parking spaces are to be replaced by a small green area.«This loses space for eight tents.
I have no idea how to replace this, »says Tognella.At another point, a junction with a high curb is planned on the route.He was unhappily placed for the Chilbi - just at the point with the highest number of people, there is a stumbling block.
Restrictions of this kind made it difficult to organize and approve the chilbi.GLP loses its standing civil engineering office, this actually needs to know, says Tognella, because there is always an consultation with the Chilbi, and the office is there.«It would actually be nice if the urban offices would be considerate of tradition.
We could have been asked.If I were still a politician, I would now say: The civil engineering office just wants the bike route
Press through. »The Schwamendingen Chilbi is always a festival of the political parties in the city.Two parties would be affected by the problems.The status of the GLP would have to disappear completely, the SP would have to reduce its tent area by half.
There are two of those parties that drive bike routes and reducing parking.If you didn't know it any better, you almost have to accept it, Tognella is very happy about this ironic note.In the quarters, many defend themselves against the new preferential routes for cyclists.

Only half of all streets for cars / / mobility of the future The ETH begins a visionary project for CO2-neutral traffic in the city of Zurich.
It focuses primarily on e-bikes, bicycles and e-trottinette instead of cars.Joachim Laukenmannzurich would hardly be recognizable, the ideas of researchers from ETH Zurich are so drastic.With the “E-Bike City” lighthouse project, you are fundamentally re-plan the urban mobility.
"We no longer want to think of the city from the car, but from the perspective of e-bikes and other micromobiles such as bicycles and e-trottinettes," says Kay Axhausen from the Institute for Transport Planning and Transport Systems of the ETH Zurich, which heads the project.The starting point is the requirement that 50 percent of the traffic area in Zurich should only be available to the micromobiles.Most streets would be halved in a one-way lane for cars and a double lane for e-bikes, bicycles and e-trottinette.
What are the consequences for the accessibility of different places within the city and for connecting agglomeration?How would everyday life change?Can the greenhouse gas emissions of city traffic actually be reduced to zero with this approach?
And would such a concept that put massively on active locomotion and public transport would accept the population at all?These are some of the questions that the project wants to answer.Officially, it starts this Wednesday, runs around three years and costs around CHF 1.7 million.
Seven chairs from the areas of traffic planning, transport systems, infrastructure management, ecological system design, geoinformation engineering, road traffic technology as well as spatial development and urban policy are involved.E-bikes are supposed to solve a dilemma of transport policy "With the" E-Bike City "project, we want to solve a dilemma of today's transport policy," says Axhausen.
“Empirical studies show that good accessibility of work and the social environment has a positive effect on social productivity.»This means that a reliable transport network, in which all participants get to the destination at any time, gets well and quickly, if not being expanded.But the desired good accessibility has a dark side if the car plays a major role: "Even if we gradually replace fossil cars with electric cars in the future, the emissions of traffic will not go quickly enough," says Axhausen.
"Because the climate goals give us hard and close emission limits, which we should reach relatively quickly." In order to escape from this case, the researchers of the ETH are fully on micromobility: e-bikes are so fast that they are on the move that they can be reached wellcan maintain."They produce much less CO2 than a car, both in production and use," says Axhausen.
"In addition, they need less space than cars and therefore create new opportunities for urban planning." How Zurich presents when around half of today's street area belongs to the micromobiles, the researchers want to examine from different perspectives - the project is therefore divided into nine sub -projectswho each devote themselves to a challenge.For example, this is the rededication of the streets.Many one -way streets and dead ends are created for the remaining car traffic.
Nevertheless, it must be guaranteed that delivery services, ambulance, fire brigade and police quickly get to the destination."We are therefore developing a computer -aided tool with which we can optimize the system from one -way bike," says Axhausen."Nobody imagines that a stroke patient is transported to the hospital on the cargo bike." Another challenge is public transport.
"In an e-bike city, the demand for public transport will vary more than today, both during the year and daily," says Axhausen.On a rainy day, many will switch from the micromobile to public transport and also use public transport in winter than in summer.Which routes are preferred?
What do the timetables and the application planning have to look like to meet these variable requirements?According to the project application, it would be obvious that the public transport planned for several days and, depending on the weather, rely on one of several predefined operating modes.In order to find out how the population is basically a e-bike city, it is interviewed in another sub-project.
"Without the willingness to actively move with e-bike or bike, it won't work," says Axhausen.However, it must also be ensured that people who are not so mobile would get to the destination at any time, for example using public transport or autonomous vehicles that may exist in the future.Further sub-projects examine whether the CO2 goals with e-bike city are actually achieved, which routes people prefer, how the bauna forms have to be adapted, how accidents can be minimized and what the conversion of Zurich into e-bikeCity would cost. "Ultimately, we want to show for Zurich how the road network of an e-bike city could be specific and what this would mean for the traffic and activity pattern of the population," says Axhausen.
The concept should also be transferred to other cities.Zurich City Councilor Simone Brander (SP) is fundamentally in favor of giving the environmentally friendly foot and bike traffic more space and reducing car traffic."However, the priority is on bicycle traffic and not on faster e-bike traffic," says Brander.
«The high pace is conflicting.In addition, e-bikes only contribute to the achievement of the net zero goals when they replace car trips. »The civil engineering office of the city of Zurich supports the NOTLAUT NOTLAUT Brander's civil engineering office is currently supporting another research project by ETH Zurich, called e-biking in Switzerland.
It examines the traffic behavior of bicycle travelers, the frequency of use of the e-bikes and their potential to reduce CO2 and the route selection.The city council is interested in the new ETH project “E-Bike City”."However, our priorities for more areas are more general than in the e-bike project," says Brander.
“In addition to bicycle traffic, they also include foot traffic and heat capacity.Therefore we do not support this project.»The Federal Office of Streets will not participate in the“ E-Bike-City ”project, as spokesman Thomas Rohrbach announced.
Finally, the implementation of the project is the cantons, municipalities and cities."But we are very interested in the results." As Axhausen says, the researchers want to present the specific draft for Zurich by 2025.«We are open to results in our studies.
We still don't know if the e-bike city works.»It is important that in the minds of the city dwellers and in the minds of politicians, a picture arises as to what a future e-bike city looks like and what consequences they would have."We hope that we can create such a picture." You can find the link to the live stream of the kick-off event of "E-Bike-City" on the ETH Zurich website.
A project by ETH Zurich is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of city traffic to zero: Critical mass demonstration in Zurich at the end of June.

These worsen the environmental balance because they hardly replace car rides, but rather footpaths and journeys with the bike.But the companies have learned, says Kay Axhausen from ETH Zurich, co-author of the study.The companies would build the electric mobile more durable and optimize the operating processes.
Batteries are also significantly less environmentally stressful today."This is why the environmental balance of e-bikes and e-trottinettes are better than we had accepted for our study." This is also shown by a current study by the Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research (ISI) in Karlsruhe andTrottinett provider Lime.
Accordingly, the latest generation of shared e-trottinette and e-bikes can reduce the CO2 emissions.According to study author Konstantin Krauss from Fraunhofer ISI, the methodology of the study, the different values for life cycle emissions and the cities under consideration can explain the deviation from the results of the ETH.As part of the ETH “E-Bike City” project, the environmental balance sheet is to be viewed again in detail.

Passers -by in the future for pedestrians and pedestrians against Velos on the Birsfeld Rheinpromenade will have the passers -by before the bike.
The latter can only pass the path at walking pace.The Birsfelden community announced this yesterday.The Marie-Lotz-promenade has always been a meeting zone between different stakeholders, according to the municipality in a media release.
The direct connection along the Rhine between Birskopfsteg and lock is often used not only by pedestrians, but also by bike travelers.Velo driving ban required combination of foot and bike path always led to complaints and security concerns.
Therefore, a collection of signatures in 2021 called for a general driving ban on the promenade.The municipal council took on the topic and, together with an engineering office, analyzed the situation and re -regulated, according to the community.Pedesters are newly received by two -wheeler traffic.
The Marie-Lotz promenade becomes a footpath on which Velos can only drive at walking pace.However, a complete ban on driving is initially dispensed with.The Marie-Lotz promenade should continue to be available to two-wheeler traffic.
A corresponding signaling of the adapted traffic routing is carried out using traffic signs and soil markings.In addition, the already existing cycling route will be better signaled and communicated.The now chosen solution was drawn up under the involvement of Pro Velo of both Basel, emphasizes Birsfelden.
It is a compromise to protect passers -by.However, if the situation on site does not relax in the future, it is important to think about the ultimate consequence of implementing a general driving ban.In two years, the municipality wants to evaluate the measure that has now been implemented.

It examines the traffic behavior of bicycle travelers, the frequency of use of the e-bikes and their potential to reduce CO2 and the route selection.The city council is interested in the new ETH project “E-Bike City”."However, our priorities for more areas are more general than in the e-bike project," says Brander.
“In addition to bicycle traffic, they also include foot traffic and heat capacity.Therefore we do not support this project.»The Federal Office of Streets will not participate in the“ E-Bike-City ”project, as spokesman Thomas Rohrbach announced.
Finally, the implementation of the project is the cantons, municipalities and cities."But we are very interested in the results." As Axhausen says, the researchers want to present the specific draft for Zurich by 2025.«We are open to results in our studies.
We still don't know if the e-bike city works.»It is important that in the minds of the city dwellers and in the minds of politicians, a picture arises as to what a future e-bike city looks like and what consequences they would have."We hope that we can create such a picture." You can find the link to the live stream of the kick-off event of "E-Bike-City" on the ETH Zurich website.
A project by ETH Zurich is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of city traffic to zero: Critical mass demonstration in Zurich at the end of June.

These worsen the environmental balance because they hardly replace car rides, but rather footpaths and journeys with the bike.But the companies have learned, says Kay Axhausen from ETH Zurich, co-author of the study.The companies would build the electric mobile more durable and optimize the operating processes.
Batteries are also significantly less environmentally stressful today."This is why the environmental balance of e-bikes and e-trottinettes are better than we had accepted for our study." This is also shown by a current study by the Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research (ISI) in Karlsruhe andTrottinett provider Lime.
Accordingly, the latest generation of shared e-trottinette and e-bikes can reduce the CO2 emissions.According to study author Konstantin Krauss from Fraunhofer ISI, the methodology of the study, the different values for life cycle emissions and the cities under consideration can explain the deviation from the results of the ETH.As part of the ETH “E-Bike City” project, the environmental balance sheet is to be viewed again in detail.

More security on the bike when starting / / earlier green in Zurich at the intersection of Badenerund Seebahnstrasse there is now an extra light signal for bike.
The white bike has been reminiscent of the fatal accident of a bicycle driver at Lochergut for two months.At the Badener / Seebahnstrasse intersection, the 25-year-old was overwhelmed by a truck turned right.Now the traffic department of the city of Zurich reacted and on Wednesday as an additional immediate measure, installed a separate Veloampel, as media spokeswoman Nadja Häberli confirms on request.
This traffic light switches to green five seconds earlier than those for cars and is therefore also called ahead.This enables bicycles waiting in the red light to accelerate earlier.This is particularly important for those bicycle people who, due to space constraints, cannot line up in the so -called bike sac.
The four -meter -deep waiting area for cyclists in front of the car was already attached to the intersection in May because the traffic department had recognized the location as a danger point for some time.The city has implemented five locations in the city with a right of way for Velosvorgrün-Bampeln at five other locations since 2021.Two to turn right are installed at the crossings Friesenberg- / Schweighhofstrasse and Rudolf-Brun-Brücke / Limmatquai.
A particularly sophisticated pre-green area and so far the only one of its kind is at the Hofwiesen-/Wehntalerstrasse intersection.There, a thermal sensor records bicycle travelers, the single traces on the Hofwiesenstrasse in the Velosack.A bike amplifier on the lighting mast at the intersection signals the pre-green phase that wants to turn left.
Two more traffic lights on Birmensdorferstrasse allow Velo's right of way straight ahead.They are on the height of Talwiesen / Gutstrasse and Heuried.Similar solutions in other places in the city are checked.
Phase separation would be a safe man for a high risk for bike drivers when turning right.If you drive into large vehicles in the green phase of the cars from behind, you will continue to get into the corner of the corner and run the risk of being overlooked.The young bike driver at the Lochergut may have been doomed.
According to Wernher Brucks, Head of Road Safety at the city, more security would offer a complete “phase separation” for bicycles and cars.
Bicycle drivers and drivers who are on the same direction, varied, never have green, never at the same time.However, this measure has a decisive disadvantage: the waiting times at the intersection are longer.

Over 600 Basel loanos remain unused daily / / / The two-million flop on average, only 14 trips with the bicycle companions are made per day.
The canton still wants to expand the offer and continue to invest in "space -saving" mobility forms.Benjamin landlords are you quickly, when you finally saw someone on the bright red rental bike of the canton of Basel-Stadt?
Not ?Don't worry, that is almost certainly not up to you.On the contrary :
Of the cantonal bicycles that have been worth more than two million francs to the city, hardly has been used for over a year and a half.The project seems to be overriding to the flop.In September 2021, an euphoric traffic director Esther Keller (GLP) presented the new fleet called Velospot.
"The rental velos should be used several times a day to relieve public space," said the government councilor.The Biel company Intermobility was awarded the contract for the project.At that time, money from commuter funds was controversial.
Because with Pick-E-Bike, an established fleet provider has been working in Basel since 2018 and has over 30,000 customers.Nevertheless, the canton considered it appropriate to launch his own project and to subsidize it from the commuter fund with CHF 2.15 million.The “Basler Zeitung” wrote shortly after the launch: “Not clearly marked stations, a bumpy driving experience, IT problems with the app and website.
This is the conclusion of the short self-test with the new e-loan.Who uses this offer in such circumstances? »It has been shown: very few.
Last summer, the online portal “Prime News” made it public for the first time that the rental system was little in touch and that the canton missed its target: Until last year, the BVD of the Basel population wanted to provide 2000 Velos at 350 stations.In the meantime, there are 640 rental bikes that are available for rent at around 250 different locations.
On request, Nicole Ryf, spokeswoman for the traffic department, shows remarkable figures.The Basler and the Basler and the tourists only took around 6800 trips by the end of December and covered around 66,000 kilometers with the rental bikes.On average, this has been 14 rents a day since the project started.
If we assume that a new vehicle will always be used for every trip, 626 bicycles are unused in the city every day.For comparison: Pick-e-bike has a total of 317,000 trips in the same period.Which means: The offer is used by around 650 people every day.
Why this immense difference?It is probably not due to the price, the offer of Picke-Bike (35 centers per minute) is even a little more expensive than that of the canton (25 centimes per minute).What is the responsibility of the operator, the company Intermobility?
Is the offer simply too unattractive?In Thun, for example, the company also worked, but the city ended the partnership due to contractual disagreement after a short time.Quite different in Basel: Spokeswoman Ryf claims that the canton works well with the company.
«Intermobility is constantly revising your offer and has improved both the website and the app based on the legitimate criticism.»A change of operator is not up for debate.The contract with the Biel company still takes around three years.
However, the BVD spokeswoman admits that the numbers are “still at a modest level”.«We also see how the range of popularity gains, the more stations and bicycles are available.The expansion progresses with great steps and should be completed in 2023.
»There would already be 1,000 bicycles available, but not all of them are used due to the lower demand in winter.Is it worth it ?
In view of the weak use, the meaning and purpose of the upcoming expansion may at least be questioned.But the canton takes the view that the attractiveness of the rental system essentially depends on high availability."You want to find a bike where you spontaneously decide on a ride and can then turn it off again wherever you want to go," explains Ryf.
"With every additional station, we get one step closer to a nationwide offer." In addition, it is "very good" possible that the canton will in future invest in further, "space -saving" mobility forms in order to relieve the habitat.“There is no way around this: We are pursuing new ideas with great interest.»
The only question remains: Are these investments worthwhile for the population?District Councilor Esther Keller presented the cantonal loan velos in September 2021.
Photo: Nicole Pont-Klassische and E-Velos over three years after Pick-E-Bike introduced the first bike loan system in Basel, the Intermobility company called another offer called Velospot.The company from Biel went into operation with electrical and classic companions in the large and small basel.She supported the Canton of Basel-Stadt with CHF 2.15 million.

More space for Velos on the Lucerne ring / / car track disappears bike travelers on the busy Basel Lucerner ring towards St. Johann taut - there is more space for cars.
The canton wants to test a new layout.Rückstaus can be expected.The canton fits the traffic routing on the Lucernerring knot /
Burgfelderstrasse as part of a traffic attempt, as the Basel construction and traffic department announced yesterday.Before the intersection in the direction of St. Johann, car travelers can only turn on the right road and no longer drive straight ahead.After the intersection, only buses or bicycles will be allowed to drive to one of the two lanes.
Bus traffic could be affected by the new traffic routing is planned for one year.If the test leads to more traffic safety, the canton wants to permanently attach the marking.Based on investigations in the run -up to the experiment, it can be assumed that the lane reduction will lead to backlog in car traffic, which would also have an impact on bus traffic, the statement continues.
The canton wants to avoid delays as far as possible and provides a demolition of the experiment if a possible backlog leads to dangerous situations or there should be strong delays for public transport.At the Lucerne ring there are always dangerous situations between car and bike travelers.This, among other things, because after the intersection with the Burgfelderstrasse there is no longer a bike strip and bike travelers have to share the road by bus and cars.
In April 2021, a 50-year-old cyclist died when she was hit by a truck at the intersection.According to the police, the Lucerne ring is one of the focus of the accident.Pro Velo of both Basel recently launched the petition "for a safe velor route on the Lucerne ring", the association referred to the corresponding section on the Lucernerring as "death trap". The marking measures planned for the new traffic management are now published in the cantonal leaf.

Nobody is satisfied with the first Zurich Velo-Highway / / Tobias Martian Wind and Weather, the two Zurich city councilors Simone Brander (SP) and Karin Rykart (Greens) opened the first so-called Zurich “Velo preferred route” on Thursday.The Velo Highway, which runs along the Basler and Bulllingerstrasse, measures almost three kilometers and connects Altstetten with circle 4.
The project is part of the “Safe Velorouute for Zurich” popular initiative, which was accepted in 2020, with which the city is to become a bicycle until 2030.The reactions on the prestige project are similar to the weather.So drivers shook their heads because suddenly a one -way street appeared where they still had free travel last week.
Due to the many new and colored markings, residents were already harvesting tax money.And even some a bike driver quietly doubted the meaning of the new Velor route, as could be seen in a tele-Züri video this week when the route could already be used by everyone.In order to get the confusion, city police officers had to regulate the traffic and traffic cadets were called up.
Traffic innovations «We don't say, that is the absolute super solution.To do this, we would have to take further measures on other routes, »said Simone Brander in front of the media on Thursday.But here the implementation was very quick: "So that you can see something first." There are also various traffic innovations to see:
A 40 centimeter wide green ribbon on the side of the road is supposed to “significantly withdraw the route”, as Karin Rykart said.The strip only serves the orientation that it does not have to be driven on it.Tempo 30, a right to go to the cycle for cyclists, new one -way streets, lifted legal advance and hazardous hazards marked with red are additional innovations.
"Our goal is a good cooperation," said Simone Brander, and this needed "space at the expense of car traffic". For the 70 centimeter wide safety distance from the road to the parking spaces, other parking spaces had to be "placed"."We also had to pick up parking spaces to get the 4 meters 80, on which two bicycles can drive at the same time," said Karin Rykart.So the city repelled 114 parking spaces for the first Veloroute.
After all, there is no entitlement to parking spaces for the blue zone, the police officer said.The courts recently found this.What does “car -free” mean? Over 6000 parking spaces are likely to disappear as a whole because of the bike net.
According to Rykart, around 500 pieces in the blue zone are lifted in the blue zone for the routes in Höngg, Schwamendingen and those from Oerlikon to Affoltern.Accordingly, hundreds of objections from private individuals and traders were received against these three bike routes.Rykart: «We are currently blocked on these routes.»
The route in Wollishofen should go ahead.The city also wants to put on the section from Franklinplatz in Oerlikon to Forchstrasse next month.It remains to be seen whether it is also hailing here.
What goes too far for the invoice was a procedure for others on Thursday.Silas Hobi, Managing Director of «Revolter», criticized a traffic policy organization: «Car traffic has to be reduced even more.
Paths are only needed for bicycles."Hobi was bothered by the fact that the city defines" car -free "with a daily advancement of 2000 cars." For us it is car -free if there is no more through traffic, "Karin Rykart countered this criticism.Bringers and residents would have to be able to drive up by car, the law requires.
According to Rykart, one-way streets and speed 30 should be able to “bring away” through traffic. The city wants to observe its first bicycle highway for a few years.In a further stage, the traffic in the quarters would be reorganized, said Simone Brander.
Zurich has his first bike preference route as the vocal people wanted, but nobody may clap."It's new and you have to get used to it," said Karin Rykart, who already mastered the route by bike.Simone

Velo fast roads are supposed to brake / / / without stopping no jet to work, safely overtaking and going shopping: all of this should make bicycles possible.
Velo-Schnellstrasse should offer an alternative to main lines and highways.Swiss people already like to commute to work with the bike.However, according to SRF, it is only nine percent of the employed population.
This should change only for cyclists, without dangerous obstacles and intersections.The Netherlands have experience with such bicycles: they are largely cross -free, two bicycles side by side have space without any problems and cyclists usually have ahead.
Since the creation of these trains, traffic on motorways has decreased by ten percent.According to an unpublished study by the Federal Office of Strasse (Astra), there is also potential for this infrastructure in Switzerland, especially in the agglomerations, as the SRF reports.With the increase in e-bikes, bicycles are an attractive alternative to the car, »says Erwin Wieland, deputy director of the Astra, to the SRF.
Study results have shown that 2 to 4 percent of today's highway load could be shifted.The biggest challenge is to plan the bicycles spatially.Pro Velo Switzerland supports such projects.
The website says: «Velobahn is infrastructures that enable rapid driving with as few breaks as possible and high comfort.Many of them are already in operation in leading bicycle countries such as Denmark, Netherlands and Germany.Such tracks are also an issue in Switzerland. »The city of Zurich inaugurated its first bike preferential route in early March.
More should follow.On a short section of the route in Zurich-Wollishofen, over 100 parking spaces on the blue zone are to be canceled for a bike preference route.Thousands of others should follow.
Now the residents are defending themselves.City councilor Simone Brander: «The city implemented an order from its voters.»Over 70 percent would have spoken out for this.
And the bike is ideal in general.«It doesn't take up much space, is ecological, inexpensive and very efficient in city traffic.Today's road network is largely geared towards car traffic.»
With the preferred routes, the bike is made more attractive."Velos, together with public transport and foot traffic, secure the future of mobility in densely populated urban areas and contribute to the achievement of climate protection goals." Janine Enderli

Every fifth ride on the bike is not enough / / / bicycle boom in Bern bike travelers now make up almost 20 percent of traffic in the city of Bern.
Now the city wants to advance the expansion of the bike frastructure.Bernhard Ottundmarius Aschwandenjede Fifth trip in the city of Bern is to be completed with the bike in 2030.
That was the main goal of the bike offensive that the local council founded nine years ago.All the more astonishment is the latest figures from the Federal Office for Spatial Development to the traffic behavior of the population.An analysis of the data by Patrick Rérat from the University of Lausanne shows that the city of Bern almost achieved its goal two years ago.
In recent years, the number of bicycle has not increased as strongly in any other Swiss city as in the federal city.In 2015, the percentage of bicycle travelers in the entire traffic was still 14.8 percent, it was 19.2 percent in 2021.In other words, two years ago, every fifth ride was passed by bike.
For Michael Sutter, this is quite reason to be happy.At the same time, the President of Pro Velo Bern also says that the 20 percent bike content was realistic by 2030, but not particularly ambitious."Now it would make sense to target a share of 30 percent," says Sutter.
And he adds: "The city is still far away from the other goal of the bike offensive - a safe infrastructure for all cyclists." Dangerous intersection endies shows that the city of Bern has almost been victims of its own success.Sutter says that the infrastructure could not keep up with the strong and rapid increase in bike.In addition, the bicycle lobbyist is of the opinion that the city could do more.
"Unfortunately, the bike offensive has lost their swing within the administration and should get more priority again." What he means by that he illustrates with a few examples: - The Velohaup routes on Laupenstrasse, Effingerstrasse or Thunstrasse still have no continuous bike lane.
The intersections on Guisanplatz, the Henkerbrünnli or at the Burgern target are still too dangerous and would be deterrent for bicycle travelers. There are still too few bike parking spaces at the train station.Despite this need for action, Sutter also says: «The city of Bern is not bad in the Switzerland comparison.»
But it takes even more commitment to achieve the overall goal, namely an interruption -free and safe bike infrastructure for all people between eight and eighty years.In addition, the boom in fast e-bikes also requires further action so that dangerous overtaking maneuvers could be avoided as far as possible due to the lack of or too close bicycle traces. "There is still a lot to do with" with regard to the expansion of the infrastructure runs Sutter at the Stadtberner traffic director Marieke Kruitopen doors.
It confirms the increase in the bike content calculated by researcher Rérat and speaks of a "beautiful result".In terms of numbers, the municipal council had "actually achieved practically" the goal for 2030.She attributes this to a covid effect that might have prompted people to switch to the bike, since the bike content in Zurich in 2021 has dropped.
For them, the conclusion is obvious that "that bike funding in the city of Bern should be the decisive factor". This is no reason for Kruit.«There is still a lot to do.»The traffic director thinks less about further increasing the proportion of the driving kilometers covered with the bike, but of the expansion of the infrastructure.
In the next few years it is about "that we create the bike infrastructure that corresponds to demand and, above all, is safe".There are already “projects in the pipeline” for the hotspots for bicycle travelers mentioned by Pro Velo.The bicycle measures are part of overarching projects.
In the vicinity of the train station, the need for parking spaces also remains high, despite the planned bike station in Welle 7, says Kruit.According to the traffic expert Rérat, the city of Bern does the right thing with the bike offensive.
Because the most important prerequisite for their success is the creation of efficient and safe bike compounds and the creation of incentives to change, for example by providing a bike rental like PubliBike.Nevertheless, the potential in Bern is far from exhausted."The Swiss Velo-Champions Bern and Basel would be at the end of the city's list in the Netherlands," says Rérat.
Who is changing to the bike?Like Velolobbyist Sutter, Rérat sees catching up to do when adapting the infrastructure to the e-bike.Even if the majority of the bicycle paths were covered with conventional bicycles, the e-bike boom could not be stopped in Bern either.
In order to enable the coexistence of bicycles at different speeds, there are enough wide bicycle routes and sufficient parking spaces.The question is still open who the new bike travelers are.To do this, the federal figures must be downgraded to the cities in detail.
After all, the city of Bern also wants to reduce the proportion of car traffic by 20 percent by 2030.This usually ensures more political explosives than the bike offensive when it comes to the introduction of speed 30 or the cancellation of parking spaces in favor of bike tracks.Kruit announces the corresponding figures for the city “in the next few weeks”.
The evaluation of the last available data from 2015 has shown that the city of Bern has so far not been able to convince the car travelers from changing change.Rather, it is pedestrians or bus and tram travelers who have chosen the bike as a means of transport.Bern has the strongest increase in bike traveling bike instead of car:

City is launching the next phase of bike offensive / / traffic cyclists now make up 20 percent of traffic in the city of Bern.
The expansion of the infrastructure cannot keep up with this boom.Bernhard Ottundmarius Aschwanden / Mob more piercing bicycle lanes, safer intersections, more parking spaces for bicycles: The city of Bern is planning the next expansion to improve the transport infrastructure for cyclists.
The Stadtberner traffic director Marieke Kruit (SP) says: «There is still a lot to do."In the next few years it is about" that we will create the bike infrastructure that corresponds to demand and, above all, is safe ".This also laid the basis for any further growth.
The background of the announcement: The city of Bern has already reached its goal for 2030 to increase the bike content of traffic to around 20 percent.The proportion of bike rides in total traffic from almost 15 percent in 2015 was increased to over 19 percent in 2021.The number of bicycle travelers has not increased in any other larger Swiss city in such a strong manner.
The city of Bern is on the right track with the bike offensive, which started in 2014, says traffic expert Patrick Rérat from the University of Lausanne.However, the potential is much larger and far from being exhausted.«The cities of Bern and Basel are the bike champions in Switzerland.

Residents fear Velo-Rowdys / / Michael von Ledebures was one of those plans that sound great.Zurich should finally make a network of kilometers of bike highways into the Velostadt.
The large plan should occur instead of the previous small small, which many cyclists frustrated in Zurich-all the bicycle paths that are also footpaths, bicycle tracks that measure several meters and then a few decimal and often disappear involuntarily.Now the first Velor route in Circle 4 has been in operation for several weeks.It leaves many at a loss - because the green markings confuse the lane on the left and right and because many cars are still driving on it.
There is also resistance to the bike route project because of the parking lot.In Höngg, Schwamendingen as well as Oerlikon and Affoltern, routes have been blocked for years through objections.While objections were expected in these rather bourgeois quarters, the route planners in the civil engineering office are now experiencing rejection of the unexpected side.
In Wollishofen, 480 objections to the route from the neighborhood were received.The senders are not concerned with parking spaces.But about school children.
Obstacles of disappearing tenor: Automobilists and frenzied cyclists become a danger in the neighborhood if all obstacles such as “Berlin pillows” and offset parking space disappeared from the road.This is the case on bike routes by default.
Free travel is wanted.Objections are primarily to be confused with objections without legal importance and not with objections.These only come to the train when a specific route is advertised.
But the signal is clear.In Wollishofen, resistance is shown on a broad front.Fritz «Itzi» Klein helped to coordinate it.
The 73-year-old business economist still lives in the family home, where he grew up.He has known his five fellow campaigners from the neighborhood since childhood.The “Neighborhood Wollishofen” has called for objections using flyers.
She had transparent printed with the Wollishofer coat of arms and the slogan "Veloroute - not here". As the city council recently paid Wollishofen a regular official visit, gave way and ensured that the streets that scraped the committee was lined with transparentwere .Even the organic farmer, whom the city councils visited, and the restaurateurs, where they ate die at lunch, are pronounced route opponents.Then Klein also helped a chance: the city council ran into the arms to the musician Vera Kaa, who lives in the neighborhood and is with some city councilors.
To astonish, she revealed herself as the opponent of the bike route.On Tele Züri, Vera Kaa spoke to the camera on the same day.Most of this street are bicycle and no drivers, they chose green.
«But they see that it is a total nonsense, on a street on which bike and cars come together perfectly, to set up a bike street.»Ferred cyclists are" much more dangerous "for the many schoolchildren than a car.What can protest do against the implementation of a request that the voters have agreed twice, most recently when accepting the traffic position in autumn 2021?
Klein says that as far as he could remember, he also said to the initiative.But he expected a pragmatic implementation.«Here, in a quiet neighborhood road, you don't have to change anything.»
Only the bike route initiative was based on building bike routes on neighborhood roads.It is hard to imagine that the planners move away from the idea of a uniform design.Velos must be able to overtake the civil engineering office confirms this.
The routes should be designed in such a way that bikes could drive side by side and overtake each other."In order to be able to adhere to the required standard on bicycle routes, a minimum width of the roadway of 4 meters 80 is required." On the subject of school children, the civil engineering office points out that pedestrian strips are planned in the area of school houses in order to brake automobiles and cyclists.Nevertheless, it is clear:
The blockade also threatens in Wollishofen.Even for crystal-clear supporters of the bike route idea, fundamental questions arise about implementation.This has to do with the cars that still run on the first Velor route.
It was inaugurated in March and leads from district 4 to Altstetten.Some bothers that car traffic is allowed.The traffic -political environmental organization by traffic clearly criticizes the first velor route.
It only demands paths for Velos.Daily 2000 cars on this bike route are too much, the car had to be pushed even more back.How realistic this requirement is is questionable.
According to the civil engineering office, through traffic was already banished by the route.And residents are not allowed to ban access by car.So another question arises:
Does it really have space in Zurich's street space for 4 meters for 4 meters?Or does not necessarily result in a mixed traffic compromise?Yvonne Ehrensberger, Managing Director of Pro Velo, does not see the project questioned.
She can understand that some are disappointed with the first Zurich Veloroure.«The expectations were very high.“But the city could learn thanks to this first route.
«And despite all the legitimate criticism, it is progress.The driving flow is better and more cyclists are on the track. ”The great concern that“ frenzied people ”on the bike on the bike route would be a security risk for schoolchildren, says Ehrensberger.«There is a lack of experience.
Abroad you can see that consistent bike routes in the quarters can be enormous quality gain.It would be nice if people opened up a little and wait a bit with their judgment. ”Simone Brander, the responsible city councilor, said at the opening of the first velor route in March:“ We don't say that this is the absolute super solution.But implementation was possible very quickly here.
So that you can see something first.»The Velorouute idea comes from the kitchen of the SP.In 2017, the party discovered the bike topic for itself.
As one with which a great potential electorate in urban Zurich could be addressed.The plan opened politically.The bike initiative not only came about, but was clearly accepted in 2020.
And Simone Brander, the SP Velopolitian par excellence, was elected to the city council.Now she can implement her own initiative.Even the administration has now been committed to the bike course after initial resistance, one hears from politicians from different straps.
The prerequisites would actually be ideal for a quick implementation.But it is obviously complicated.The green line is only decoration, but is used, even though danger is threatened by the car do of opening.

This is behind the doldrums of the bicycle boom / / Francesca Praderdie city
Zurich is said to become a Velostadt.For this purpose, the city creates Veloparkhäuser or plans Velo preferred routes, the first was opened in March.The Effort is justified with the increasing number of cyclists:
You need space for this.The federal government carries out the most important measurement to the share of modes of transport, specifically the Federal Office for Statistics and Spatial Development.In Switzerland, around 55,000 people are questioned randomly about their mobility behavior.
These federal offices actually measure the distribution of modes of transport every five years.But because of the shutdown in March 2020, the so -called microcensus mobility and traffic was postponed.Only data from 2015 were available via bike transport in the city of Zurich.
The latest survey is now available.Based on this, the civil engineering office of the city of Zurich has created a modal split balance.This shows how large the percentage of different means of transport is in the entire traffic volume in the urban area.
The city has written its own report.This is actually to be published on Monday, accompanied by a detailed media release, but the report can already be viewed on the city's website.The statistics are surprising with regard to the bike strategy.
The growth is only reflected marginally in the modal split: from around 8 percent in 2015, the Velo share in 2021 only rose to 8.6 percent.The city of Zurich has ambitious destinations when it comes to bicycle traffic.
Since the assumption of the urban initiative in 2011, the Zurich municipal code has stood that the proportion of motorized private transport must decrease by 10 percent within ten years.By 2015, the proportion had already dropped from 30 to 25 percent, that of public transport, foot and bike transport rose by 5 percentage points.Now the proportion of motorized private transport has increased again, to 28.5 percent 2021.
At 33.8 percent, the public transport is far behind the value of 2015.At that time, the public transport was still 40.8 percent.The city writes that you also have to look at the absolute numbers.
In the Pandemie years 2020 and 2021, both public transport and car use decreased.The bike is the "only means of transport that also recorded an increase in the absolute arcade in the urban area in 2020," says the city's report.In addition, the long -lasting bad weather periods in 2021 had slowed down the bike.
The following year, however, more than made up for it - even if this is of course not shown in the modal split."Never since the start of the bike counts have been recorded in the urban area as high breeding frequencies as this year," it says in the report, without specific figures.In view of the fact that in 2021, pandemic was still shaped, one can discuss how meaningful the now available data are.
The city states that the two pandemic years were not suitable for "assessing the long -term development of traffic and mobility behavior in the city of Zurich".However, one shows up confidently, because with the normalization of the health situation last year, the traffic situation also put on the development of ahead of Corona.It will still take at least half a decade before this is reflected in Statistics' official figures in the statistics in the city's statistics.

Clarastrasse: Pro Velo raises an objection / / holding edges The interest association for bicycle travelers per bike of both Basel defends itself against the planned high holding edges at the tram stops on Clarastrasse and on Claraplatz.
As reported yesterday, the association against the planning approval submitted to the responsible Federal Office of Transport.The Basel Verkehrsbetriebe (BVB) and the construction and traffic department (BVD) are planning to install such “bicycle-related” holding edges in the redesign of Clarastrasse and Claraplatz, even though the association had registered its concerns at an early stage and submitted suggestions for improvement."The high holding edges and the extreme proximity of the rails on the high sidewalk lead to a great danger for bicycle travelers," said Pro Velo.
Council is for bicycle measures at Clarastrasse and the passage of the Claraplatz in order to make much-use base relationships commuter routes used by bicycle travelers.The Grand Council in Basel had already decided in 2020 that so-called tram stops (bike island or bicycle island) could be realized on such streets at tram holding spots.Where such are not possible, according to the Grand Council, additional bicycle measures on bypass routes should also be planned and implemented for all renovation projects, the statement says.

New bicycle strips at the Zurich HB / / Removal of a car trail on Löwenstrasse and on Bahnhofplatz will soon be available more space for the cyclists.
If you are traveling in Zurich with the bike on the street between Löwenplatz and Bahnhofplatz towards Limmat / Central, you will share the narrow room with the car travelers and also the bus and the taxis.The city is now unpacking this traffic routing on a distance of around 300 meters, as announced yesterday.A new bike strip is created.
Less late 31er concrete becomes a track of two traces for private car traffic.And from Bahnhofplatz, Velos, Taxis and the Bus of Line 31 share a trace in the future.This should reduce the delays of the 31er, the city announced.
To do this, she expects “with slightly longer travel times for the car travelers”. The work on the new street marking starts on Sunday in Löwenstrasse.In a first step, the bike strip is implemented from the Schützengasse to the Waisenhausstrasse.This is the main section with the right curve in front of the tram houses in front of the main train station.
This is followed by the intersection with Schweizergasse so that the bike travelers can continue straight on the same track after the entrance to the Globus department store.Furthermore, the turn into Schützengasse is redesigned as a straight lane and a bicycle strip is created on the right.In the future, a private construction site traveler will only be available to Waisenhausstrasse.
Due to a private construction site on Löwenstrasse between Schweizergasse and Schützengasse, the remaining markings will only take place later, but probably until the end of 2023, the city writes.(PU) PU / Unternährer Pascalder Traffic on Löwenstrasse will be escaped.

Velo ban on Axenstrasse ensures displeasure / / key point towards the south
If you don't want to drive over an Alpine Pass, you only come to Uri via this bicycle connection.But from next week a driving ban applies to Velos.Can that go well?
Iwan Städleres is a key point in the Swiss Velonetz.If you are planning a tour via Gotthard to the south, you cannot avoid Axenstrasse.Unless you drive over the Klausen, the Oberalp, the Furka or the Susten.
On the opposite side of Lake Vierwald-through the Seelisberg Autobahn tunnel-there is always no way for cyclists from Velo drivers.Now the Federal Office of Street (Astra) wants to block this key point for Velos, as announced this week.From next Tuesday.
The busy Axenstrasse with around 16,000 vehicles every day should become safer after a fatal accident on the wolf jump last summer.The cars on the narrow street between the Brunnen and Sisikon can now run at a maximum of 60 km / h.A driving ban even applies to bicycles and moped.
And not for a few weeks or months, but for ten years.Only then - if at all - is the new Axenstrasse ready, which runs inside the mountain.Until then, the cyclists have to prepare for the fact that they cannot legally pass the route on the bicycle saddle.
As a replacement, the Astra offers a free bicycle shuttle bus.It circulates from 7.39 a.m. to 6.05 p.m. every hour between the fountain and the Tell plate in Sisikon.A maximum of 16 people including the vehicle can be transported “under liability exclusion” per trip.
Groups of 6 people from 6 people have "registered until three days before the trip during the ordinary office hours," said the Astra. "The canton would only be available in summer" that causes resentment.The Uri government has already received a critical initiative.
It comes from Flavio Gisler, who presides the largest Uri cantonal party with the middle.The bike ban can "have touristically and economically serious consequences," he writes.«The canton of Uri for moped and bike would only be accessible in summer via the Alpine passes.»
Gisler therefore suggests that the Uri government council should look for the conversation with the federal government in order to maintain bike and moped traffic on Axenstrasse.Dozens of outraged cyclists have also registered with the Astra and Pro Velo.They do not want to accept that this neuralgic bike route is interrupted to the south.
Touring and racing bikers in particular are affected.Pro Velo also understands that the Astra ensures security on this street.The new regime is "completely unsatisfactory", says Christoph Merkli, Head of Infrastructure and Politics.
«But that also applies to the previous situation.»It is life -threatening cycling on Axenstrasse today.Especially for those who adhere to the traffic rules and drive on the narrow street.
They are outdated by cars and trucks with little distance, hear annoyed horns and sometimes see one or the other outstretched middle finger.Load shuttle is said to cycle more frequently and for a long time most cyclists cycle on the sidewalk.
This is forbidden and can also take a bus.But the concern for your own life dominates.The Uri Section of the Swiss Transport Club (VCS) has therefore proposed the federal government to legalize bike on the sidewalk on this route.
But the Astra refused for security reasons.Alf Arnold, board member of the VCS Uri, regrets the bike ban, but also understands this decision.In many places, the sidewalk is so narrow that you can drive past each other poorly, especially when someone was traveling with a follower.
In some cases, you also have to change the street side, which is also dangerous.A warning plaque is already calling the bike to avoid Axenstrasse and instead take the train or ship.Now a ban should become a ban from the warning-and switching to the train, the ship or the new loading shuttle into duty.
Velo transport also free by train and ship?The planned replacement offer is not enough per bike."If you just miss the shuttle bus, you have to wait an hour for the next one," complains Christoph Merkli.
He demands a closer bar - "at least every half hour, better quarter -hour".This is particularly important on weekends and when the weather is nice.The shuttle also has to run longer in the evening than just until 6 p.m., especially in summer.
If it were up to Pro Velo, the transport of the bicycles with the S-Bahn and the ship would also be free to the Axenstrasse.In addition to the shuttle, the cyclists would have other free options.But the SBB are skeptical.
The regional train, which is traveling every hour between the fountain and the Sisikon, is only 75 meters long, SBB spokesman Reto Schärli points out.There are three to four places for bike.Additional bicycles could be parked at further places on the train, but this was not guaranteed at shock times.
You could also not extend the train, otherwise the perron in Sisikon would be too short.The last word - at least for the coming years - does not seem to be spoken yet.A “pilot phase” is now running until October, in which the Astra wants to gain experience.
Depending on the knowledge at this time, adjustments and optimizations are possible, said Astra spokesman Samuel Hool.This applies in particular to the shuttle timetable.It also remains open to what extent the bicycles will stick to the new driving ban.
With their switching to the sidewalk, they have already disregarded the traffic rules.It will be shown whether this will change on July 11th.For sure is :
Everything will be better in the distant future.Once the Axenstrasse has been moved to the mountain, there is more space for bicycles and pedestrians on the old road.But that takes a decade.
At least.In winter the only bike connection to Uritelle View, but little space: Because the street is too dangerous, many cyclists switch to the sidewalk.But that is forbidden.

Basel wants to be a bicycle city / / infrastructure, security, parking spaces in the city canton is scarce on the streets.
The corresponding infrastructure is often missing for cyclists.To expand this, you have to dismantle the car.Andrea Schuhmacherdie
Holidays are over and children flood the streets of Basel again every morning on the way to school.Many would like to be most if they had this path on foot or on the bike and not by parent taxi.But in Basel, even a number of adults do not dare to ride the city by two wheel.
Why is that?What measures does the canton take?The Office for Mobility says: Basel is a Velostadt.
But is that really true?The last question responds to traffic director Esther Keller with a clear yes: «The number of kilometers that Basler cover with the bike is increasing.»Compared to 2021, around seven percent more kilometers were driven in the city canton in 2022.
Daniel Seiler, FDP-Grossrat and Managing Director of ACS of both Basel, would-with reference to the strong bike bbby in the canton-Basel-would also refer to the bike city: "Almost every street is planned." Green Grand Council and Velokurier Jérôme Thiriet sees BaselRather on the way there: "There are still many dangerous places in the city where the Velonetz is not well developed." A comparison of the cards for the focus of the accident and for the canton's all-day routes shows that bike drivers often drive past difficult places,If you follow the route signposted for you.The hotspots are well known to all road users: Aeschenplatz, Wettsteinplatz, Heuwaage, to name just a few.Between 2011 and 2022, for example, 39 accidents with bike division occurred in the area between the hay scale and the market hall crossing.
Such numbers unsettle potential new cyclists.Traffic management adapted, bike stripes widened tester Keller admits: «Our Velonetz has weak points in different locations.
We have to fix them.»But she also refers to the measures already taken by the canton.For example the bike streets in Tempo 30 zones.
On these streets, bike drivers (and also drivers) have ahead of all the steeped streets.This allows a quick forward.In Basel, dozens of intersections have also been equipped with signs that explicitly allow bicycles to turn right at red.
The canton has also found solutions for the Lucernerring / Burgfelderstrasse knot and the Münchensteiner Bridge.In the former, the traffic routing was adjusted, and the bike track was widened to 2.60 meters in second.However, if you are often traveling with the bike in Basel, you know that there are many other danger spots away from these hotspots: streets where you can only get through tram tracks and parked cars as a bike driver.
For cyclists, threatening tram stops with high edges.Streets without separated bicycle.Missing preferred routes in the Basel area.
More bicycles means to expand less auto -infrastructure in Basel, usually means: to dismantle auto infrastructure."The city is finished," says Jérôme Thiriet.
He advocates that you create enough space for the bike and where necessary gives up parking spaces and inputs car tracks.He mentions the Münchensteiner Bridge as a positive example."Less than half of the city population has a car, only a minority still drives into the city," continues Thiriet.
Also, the expansion of the bike infrastructure only costs a fraction of what you spend on the car infrastructure. "I find it problematic that you no longer take into account the drivers," says Daniel Seiler and points out that the highest in mobility surveysTo measure dissatisfaction.He wanted an open dialogue with the bike lobbyists.He cannot confirm that the debate has occurred in recent years:
«If so, I have to find a certain resignation among drivers.»He advocates not to lose sight of the population's mobility needs.What needs do Basler actually have with regard to traffic infrastructure?
Depending on who you ask, the answer is different.More and more people with the bike on the way a look at the statistics shows that fewer and fewer people have a car in Basel.With around 320 cars per 1000 inhabitants, Basel is the Swiss bottom in the city comparison.
This is likely to be related to the efforts of the canton, which according to its own information has been committed to promoting bicycle traffic for over 30 years.The latest sample survey (data from 2021) to the modal split in the canton shows that around 20 percent of the paths in Basel-Stadt are covered with a bike.The car comes to 21 percent, foot traffic to 39.
Compared to the 2015 survey, this means an increase in the bike and a decrease in car traffic.However, due to the effects of pandemic, the figures from 2021 are to be enjoyed with caution.Government prepares draft law
The discussion at the urn will have to be decided in the late late late late late late late time end.In June 2022, the cantonal popular initiative “Safe Velorouute in Basel-Stadt” was submitted.
This comprises 27 points and wants to create legal foundations for safe, continuous bike routes.Accordingly, the security of pedestrians and bicycle travelers in relation to the capacities for the rolling and dormant car traffic should be given priority.At least 2.4 meters wide bicycle preferential routes should run in a star shape in and between the quarters.
Despite the lost vote on Veloring in 2017, the initiators expect good opportunities and point out similar initiatives that were also successful in other Swiss cities.The Basel government council intends to submit a draft law as part of a formulated counter -proposal.So is Basel a Velostadt?
Compared to cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where the potential of the bike has been clearly recognized as a quiet, environmentally friendly and space -saving means of transport and is accordingly promoted, the city on the Rhine knee has to catch up with a lot.Certainly in terms of infrastructure.Basel also has to get rid of his title as a stronghold of bicycle thieves and create enough bicycle spaces.

Does car traffic stagnate because of the bike offensive?/ / On the way to the turn of the mobility, the city of Bern wants to expand the bicycle infrastructure - for example with the new bike station Welle 7.
Whether more people switch from the car to bike is not (yet) detectable.Bernhard Ottjede Fifth trip in the city of Bern is completed with the bike.What the city once made as the goal of its bike offensive for 2030 has already been practically achieved, as this newspaper reported.
More bicycles also need more bike paths and parking spaces, especially around the train station.The opening of the new bike station in Welle 7 yesterday Friday symbolically stands for a new focus in the city bike offensive.The focus is not primarily on increasing the number of bike rides.
It is now more about increased investments in the infrastructure. "We want to create a bike infrastructure that corresponds to demand and is also certain,» says the responsible Bernese councilor Marieke Kruit (SP).The city's voting at the end of November last year approved the corresponding loan of CHF 2.4 million. “More order” The new bike station is the fifth near the station.
It offers jobs for people who reintegrate into the labor market.And has space for over 600 two-wheelers, whereby there are special storage areas for those with trailers, for e-bikes and cargo bikes.Kruit spoke of a first -class location at the opening.
"You can't get closer to the railway tracks." Kruit recalled that the wave 7 station should come away from the two -wheelers stationed on the Hirschengraben and on the Schanzenbrücke.«We want to create more order in public space.»As an incentive to drive into the bike station, the offer serves to remove the bike for 24 hours free of charge, which also applies in the sense of a pilot test in the nearby post-PARC.
At the same time, the traffic director announced stricter controls of the parked two -wheelers, especially on the Hirschengraben.On posters, it should be pointed out that bikes are towed after three days.From the beginning of September, the free space will be provided with a furniture for the time being.
In the medium term, the pedestrian underpass is built on the Hirschengraben, which will be part of the new train station.With the bike station Welle 7, the need for parking spaces near the train station is far from covered.In the area of the former sister house of the Burgerspital, the planning of a new station for 1300 to 2000 bicycles is "on good paths," said Kruit.
An extension of the existing bike station Schanzenbrücke and the construction of a new station in the SBB buildings on the bulwark are also intended.From the car to the bike?As gratifying as the increasing number of bicycle trips is: A transfer effect from the car on the bike cannot (yet) be proven (yet), as a look at the so -called modal split shows, the latest figures of which has calculated the municipal traffic directorate for Bern.
The modal split is based on surveys by the Federal Office for Spatial Development and illustrates the “market share” of the various means of transport.Regardless of the distance covered, it shows the proportion of ways per means of transport in the entirety of all paths that the population has covered on foot, with the bike, by public transport or by car.While the proportion of the paths covered with the bike rose from 11 (2010) to 19 percent (2021), car traffic stagnates at 22 (2010) or 23 percent (2021) - despite the pandemic that many people out of fearBefore the risk of infection prompted to use the car.
City councilor Kruit also warns of hasty conclusions because of the pandemic effect, such as the slump in public transport.For the first time in decades, the population was also traveling less.Therefore, comparisons with previous years are difficult and reliable statements.
“But it is the case that the increase in bicycle traffic should not primarily go back to people who no longer drive a car and bike.“Conversely, one could not conclude that no changeover took place at all.Less cars
However, the constant stagnation of car traffic or even a decrease register the permanent counting points in the city.All vehicles are registered there, including those of foreigners.Therefore, these absolute numbers cannot be directly compared with the relative numbers of the modal split based on a survey among the city population.
Nevertheless, it is interesting that in absolute numbers the number of cars decreases in urban areas.From 2015 to 2022, car traffic on Murtenstrasse took 10 percent, on the Monbijoubrücke by 17 percent and even 19 percent on the Lorrainebrücke, as the traffic directorate shows.Surprisingly, however, this did not result in a massive increase in traffic on the highways.
An increase was registered at the federal counters of the federal steers over a longer period from 2010 to 2021, says Kruit."However, the traffic volume on the highway has remained about the same time since 2015." City app for mobility The data from the counting points and the modals split measure different things and are distorted by pandemic effects.The city's goal is to get more change from the car from the car to more environmentally friendly means of transport.
In addition to the expansion of the bike infrastructure and traffic calming, she also relies on technological solutions.The cities of Bern, Zurich and Basel are working on the development of an app with which driving and transport offers can be organized on request, "as they only offered the car in the perception of many," says Kruit.The Bernese city population continues to move the newly opened bike station in Welle 7 at Bern train station for 600 two -wheelers.

"Detachments for car travelers are inevitable" / / Basel mobility researcher on the promotion of the field of specialist high school buttons Alex Erath sees a lot of potential for more bicycle friendliness in Basel and the agglomeration.In the interview, he explains how it could look.
Nina Jeckerherr Erath, you have implemented Velo projects in Singapore and Bern, among others.How do you judge Basel as a bike city?The Basel population is definitely friendly to the bike.
This was already shown in 2010 when the voting is decided that motorized private transport must be reduced.As a result, parking spaces were canceled, the public transport was expanded, and the situation for bike travelers has also been improved.One example is the Brunngässlein here in front of the BAZ editorial team:
Instead of a series of parking spaces, there is now a relatively wide bike strip, where none was before.But you can also see from this example that you could go further.All parking spaces are already gone - what else do you want?
A painted bicycle strip along a street at 50 km / h would no longer correspond to the required standard for new bicycle frastructures.It would be better to differentiate it from car traffic by an increase or a curb.In addition, he would have to be so wide along a Velohaupstroute that bicycle people can overtake themselves without dangerous.
We know from research that a measure, as in the Brunngässlein, is perceived by experienced bike travelers as sufficient.However, it is not enough to bring new groups of people to the bike.Here is one of the crispy of the Basel Velo strategy, which was issued in 2019.
What does this provide?In Basel it was said: There is a base network and a commuting network.
In the commuting network, the infrastructure is primarily designed for experienced and fast bicycle travelers.Other cities and now also the federal government see it differently.In what way ?
In Bern, where the former SP national councilor Ursula Wyss sat as a “Velo-Turbo” in the city government, you have a significantly different ambition than in Basel-especially where it hurt properly, i.e. on the main traffic axes.So how would the Bernese convert the Brunngässlein?You would have made a Veloweg, which was separated with flat paving stones and 2.30 meters wide.
This is more complex, but if you rebuild one route after the next until a continuous network is created, this has enormous potential.It can bring people to the bike who would otherwise have driven along the car there.As a result, everyone gets better to their goal, including traders, for whom the bike is not a real option.
Bern has already overtaken Basel in the rating of Pro Velo on bike friendliness.But the Baselers are already driving more with the bike than before.This is true .
But it is not enough to only plan the cities around the bike-even if you do it radically, as ETH is currently doing with the E-Bike City project for Zurich.If we should be successful, we have to include the agglomeration in the planning.Do Basel bidders cause car traffic in the city?
In the entire traffic caused by the Derstadt resident population, the car share is around 20 percent.It is around 35 percent in the neighboring communities and 40 to 50 percent in Aesch or Reinach.Even though the proportion of paths below six kilometers in Basel-Stadt and Baselland is about the same high.
Quite a few of these trips from the Basel area lead to the city.Improvements in Münchenstein or Binningen would therefore be more efficient overall than further measures in the city.Of course, this also applies to the neighboring communities in France and Germany.
So planning across community, cantonal and even national borders?Difficult ... quite.Also because a member of the district administrator from Dieged, of course, has a completely different connection to the topic than one from Allschwil.
But it's not just about optimizing the bike paths from the country to the city, but also between these communities.For example, take the routes between Münchenstein and Bottmingen or Reinach and Oberwil.Both are 80s, on which 100 are sometimes driven-and bike travelers only have one and a half meter wide bike strips.
Only hard -boiled people.However, if there were an expanded Veloweg, the route would also be ideal for e-bikes.What were the most sensible measures in the urban area so far?
A prime example has been getting a bit old, but still innovative: the Veloweg along the Peter-Merian House.It has been seen that there is no sensible way to implement a safe and pleasant bike connection directly along the very busy Nauenstrasse and decided to integrate a bike path into the house.The result is a very pleasant piece of route, which is slowly becoming too narrow as a victim of his success.
What are the worst of Basel sections for bicycle travelers?Above all, these are sections and intersections built in the 1960s and 1970s, such as at St. Jakob or along the inner ring.At that time the objective was a completely different one, the "car -friendly city" was built. As part of her research in Singapore, she developed a bicycle mulator that makes the "bicycle -right city" tangible.
How does this work ?In Singapore, the design of the streets is very strongly geared towards car traffic.Accordingly, there are hardly any bike travelers.
The simulator made it possible for people to find out what it feels like to drive on a road converted for Velos.There we put a bike with a virtual reality glasses to a parking space and let people drive virtually through their quarters with redesigned streets.And this year the city has redesigned the streets there.
Does the simulator also be used in Basel?Not until now .Due to the bicycle and data availability there, we chose Bern as a pilot application.
There, for example, we virtually rebuilt the busy burgers destination and made it experienced in a bicycle-friendly variant.Does every intersection have to be bicycle -friendly?It depends on what role a crossing in the Velonetz has and what the overarching goal is.
Basel-Stadt has to become CO2-neutral by 2037 and is intended to plant more trees.
How do we want to achieve this?How many car journeys and parking spaces in the street area are there?And how do we compensate for the CO2, which we will cause, for example, by the construction of the Rhine tunnel and the production of electric cars?
Initiatives are now available on these topics, such as the future initiative.If there is a yes, 0.5 percent of the road area must be converted into space for bicycles, public transport or pedestrians annually.A horror idea for many drivers.
According to the criticism, the bike is encouraged overly at the expense of the car.The space is limited in the city.It is therefore inevitable that improvements to bike intercourse cause deterioration for car travelers.
The effect is of course also wanted.Since the bike needs less space, the narrow street space is used more efficiently, which ultimately also uses the car driving who cannot switch to the bike.However, one has to be aware that, due to the measures, public transport trips are also replaced by the bike.
The city population is more common by public transport than by car.So the bike lobby harms the public transport company?At least in the city you can't quite prevent this.
In the agglomeration, however, the effect should be less pronounced.There is more potential to bring people from the car to the bike.Which brings us back to the e-bike agglomeration ... «No longer the required standard»-Alex Erath at the painted bike strip on the Brunngässlein.

Here I would not drive through / / report for cycling in Basel BAZ interns Elina Häring has never driven in the city of Velo.
Together with editor and frequent driver Dina Sambar, she still ventured on Basel's streets.That is her conclusion.Elina
Häringunddina Sambarheute has come: I will drive Velo for the first time in my life in Basel.I can drive bicycles, but Basel's streets frighten me.
The lots of traffic, the tracks - what if I come across and get under a tram or car?My tour begins at the BAZ at Aeschenplatz.But alone I don't dare to go on the street.
So my BAZ colleague Dina Sambar has to drive in front of me.At least at the beginning.At the corner of Hammerstrasse /
I am slightly overwhelmed by Riehenstrasse for the first time.A tram could come from behind and right (o my god, what do I do when a tram really comes?) And cars from all sides, and I also have to cross tracks.And who has progressed again?
Fortunately, this does not matter at the moment, I just drive Dina behind.Unfortunately not long, we change.I chew wild on my nails out of nervousness.
We are now standing at Claraplatz and want to drive towards Rheingasse.My colleague explains to me where the pitfalls (or in this case the fall tracks) are.My head buzzes - I have to pay attention to so many things:
Pedestrians, tram tracks, cars -, and, o my god, what do I do when a tram comes?You can continue via the middle bridge into Falknerstrasse.I drive quickly so that the tram doesn't have to overtake me.
Dina warns me of pedestrians who often cross the street there without looking.And promptly a gentleman with a rollator runs in front of my wheels.The Aeschenplatz was in the driving school.
I don't know where to stop.It is important that I am not in the dead corner, says Dina, so that I will not be run over if the delivery van turns.We cycle up to the Kirschgarten high school.
Two separated bike strips: how nice!I am massively overwhelmed at the intersection of the market hall.I want to turn left to the Margarethenbrücke and now stand in the middle of the tram tracks, while I let the traffic move forward from the right.
Oh my god, what do I do when a tram comes?Here I would not drive through the bike alone.That is too dangerous for me.
The next challenge is waiting for me at the Heiliggeistkirche.Traffic from all directions, again trams, pedestrians and tram rails again.In front of the Münchensteiner Bridge I drive in the wrong lane.
Dina waves me from the bike strip.From here I drive her again.I don't dare to do it alone over Aeschenplatz.
Aeschenplatz was my personal hell in the driving school, accordingly I am.But it is not as bad as feared.Maybe because I slowly know what I have to pay attention to.
The crossing of the St. Jakobs-Zur Dufourstrasse is also not as bad as feared.However, I find the opposite direction from Deraeschenvorstadt to St. Jakobs-Strasse relatively difficult.A lot of traffic and pedestrians from all possible and impossible directions.
My conclusion: With the bike you are incredibly fast in Basel.However, after this introduction, I don't trust the confusing routes alone.I would only feel really sure if I would no longer have to cross intersections with cars, tram (tracks) and pedestrians.

Leftists demand thousands of new bike parking spaces / / Francesca Praderda's car in the city of Zurich, it is almost the unpopular stepchild in the family of private transport.
In contrast to the favorite child Velo, which the city government is happy to prefer at the expense of motorized four -wheelers.Despite generously planned bicycle routes and lots of parking spaces, red-green is of the opinion that too little is done for bicycle traffic.With this view, the fact that the proportion of bicycles in overall traffic has hardly changed in recent years does nothing to do - the left speak of a "significantly increased demand".
In 2021, the proportion of bicycles and e-bikes on the traffic volume was 8.6 percent.In 2015 it was almost 8 percent.In order to make space for the - perceived or real - increase in cyclists, parking spaces for drivers prefer to be targeted.
Over 6000 parking spaces are lifted for the ten bicycle preferred routes alone.Unrealistic period of time more space not only needs bicycle traffic, but also at parking spaces for two -wheelers lack it, find SP, Greens and Al.
The existing 2000 publicly accessible systems with over 44,000 parking spaces are "insufficient for a city that wants to be bike -friendly," said Anna Graff (SP) on Wednesday in the Zurich city parliament.More storage options are particularly necessary for cargo bikes.Therefore, the left demands that the city creates 10,000 Velo and 500 Cargovelopark spaces in addition to its ongoing efforts for bicycle traffic.
Wherever possible, they should be created instead of regular car parking spaces and the soil should be sealed.The time frame: two years.That even went too far to the city council.
Civil engineering leader Simone Brander (SP) said that the need for more parking spaces for bike was undisputed.The period for the implementation is unrealistic.«The city council cannot conjure up.»
On the public reason, around 200 new bike parking spaces are feasible each year, said Brander and listed a number of planned bike stations.For example, those in the city tunnel for 900 bicycles as well as 100 special bikes or the bike station in the house for falcon.In addition, the parliament spoke half a million francs for 500 bicycle parking spaces on public soil in 2022.
Two thirds of these have already been implemented.The city council rejects the motion, but is ready to accept the advance as a less binding postulate, said Brander.Demanding in the bourgeois was the outrage about the demand of the left.
Also because they fundamentally doubted the demand in the field."You try to generate a demand with a supply, but that doesn't work that way," said Stephan Iten (SVP).His party colleague Johann Widmer criticized that the initiative aims to banish cars from the city.
The bike is the more dangerous means of transport and should be restricted.At least with regard to the security of the cyclists, Michael Schmid (Al) agreed with Widmer.The problem with which you are faced with a bike driver in Zurich is not the lack of parking spaces, but the lack of security.
Nevertheless, the AL supports the advance.Benedikt Gerth (center) did not want to get involved in the auto-against-Velo discussion.It is not expedient to demand more velopark areas with the crowbar with the crowbar.

Zurich needs a Velo-Knigge / / Marius Hubermitte in Zurich often repeats a scene on sunny days that exposes the common claim of bike as an error.The claim that it is only due to the infrastructure if cycling is perceived as an imposition.
So that a Velostadt alone is a question of state action and has nothing to do with personal responsibility.The location of the event is a street crossing where there is no shortage of infrastructure.Well -developed bike paths lead to the side of a pedestrian strip over a main artery.
A ford was left out for that.Markings on the ground show that a directional crossing would be intended for Velos.But when cyclists are waiting for green light, they prove the opposite of swarm intelligence.
They stand up on both sides of the street in full width like a battle formation.Often they also dodge on the pedestrian strip (although one has to say fairly that pedestrians do this the other way round).If the traffic lights switch on, the expected chaos occur, and everyone makes up for the other as guilty for their own misery.
Imagine that drivers in front of the Gotthard tunnel would behave in this way..The cycle path network has been visibly improved in the city in recent years.There were artfully created traffic tours painted on the asphalt including their own miniature light signals.
Solutions of high level of perfection.And then every second cyclist drives past everything.This Friday there is a great bike demonstration in Zurich, and talked a lot recently also gave the unauthorized Velo parade Critical Mass.
On the other hand, the fact that the critical mass of cyclists has often been reached on many other days is hardly an issue that the critical mass of cyclists is now often reached - where they stand in the way: on the bike paths.At the counties of the city, the volume has doubled within ten years.The frequencies are also increasing beyond the city limits, especially because of the e-bike boom.
Anyone who only moves by car or public transport may not have noticed it: even bicycles sometimes move in the staggering column traffic at shock times.Under these conditions, cyclists can no longer afford their wild west mentality.
This comes from a time when the Zurich road network was only geared towards cars and public transport.And it keeps itself because the associated victim and claim is cultivated from political opportunities.Motto: We don't give us anything, so let's take it.
It is obvious that this traffic policy claim after thirty years of red-green dominance in the city of Zurich.It is serious because cyclists suffer from the consequences themselves - over 80 percent of the bike accidents are self -accidents.The Velo desperado without respect for red lights and sidewalk is the relic of a time when Zurich was a two-wheeler desert.
But now that bicycle traffic grows faster than the infrastructure and it becomes tight on bike paths, the anarcho habit is a handicap for everyone.Two -wheelers have to become smarter to make the best of the status quo.That means rules.
Civilized cooperation, guided by common sense.And an entideologization of cycling.Because a bike is not a question of the party book, but often simply the fastest means to get from A to B.
So what rules should cyclists commit themselves?The following list is intended to serve as a suggestion what a Velo-Knigge could look like for Zurich and other cities.Wog instead of scolding: You should not adopt the ideological struggle for street space, but should behave like an ambassador in the bike.
Communicate positively, also with drivers.Find eye contact, give hand signals, thanks to the wave.In unclear situations, never force your own right, but let others go ahead.
(By the way, drivers and pedestrians do this amazingly often to bike drivers.) This has a de -escalating effect, and everyone on the street benefits.Mobile phone away, headphones out, light: The number of bike accidents increases with that of the bike.
According to statistics, often due to distraction.Anyone who is not on the matter with all their senses is a danger - also for other cyclists.The same applies to the cuts to drive without light at night.
Anyone who has ever experienced how a bike was shot out of nowhere knows that this is not possible.Braking in mixed zones: mixing pedestrians and bicycles without cycle path markings is a nonsense widespread in Zurich.
However, it is of no use to prove this by ruthlessly ruthless through crowds.Therefore: throttle speed and, if possible, drive in a chain behind others.Give stop signs:
On urban cycle paths, you are increasingly driving into column close to tight.Since bike rarely have brake lights, a surprising stop can have bad consequences.One should therefore take over the Danish rule: lift a hand vertically to announce a braking.
Show turning: Often turning maneuvers in Zurich are half -hearted or not at all indicated.This is risky and inhibits the flow of traffic because other road users have to wait unnecessarily due to the unclear intentions.
The arm should be stretched, when turning left, the view over the shoulder is also a must, otherwise it will be life -threatening.Many ignore this.If you are afraid of loosening your hand from the handlebar, you have to practice this before going on the street.
No criminal overtaking maneuvers: everyone has a different pace at the bike.This annoys those who are slowed down and makes the nervous people who sit up.The result is hair -raising maneuvers.
The principle must be: overtaking is only left if there is enough space and you have no oncoming traffic (on the bike path).A look at the shoulder is mandatory.
Not just because of cars;Other bicycles could also have set to overtake.If in doubt, you should relax and adapt your own pace.
The green waves: Many red lights are coordinated over long distances, so there is often an ideal pace with which you can avoid a tedious stop-and-go.A green wave is also indirectly created for Velos when a cycle path has a clocked main street several times at traffic lights, such as the Zurich sea basin.Those who internalize such patterns drive neither too quickly nor too slowly.
This reduces anger and unnecessary overtaking maneuvers.In line with the pace: The Zurich “Velosack” is a marked waiting area in which Velos stand side by side in red light.Fast drivers should line up here on the left.
So you can quickly pull away at green and get back onto the bike path without braking the traffic unnecessarily.This avoids that annoyed drivers accelerate past a slowly sorting field, which is dangerous for everyone.No pack formation in the event of crossings: At the road crossing of a bike path with two directions, you should not set up in full width in red light (as described at the beginning), but be behind the already waiting bikes.
With green, both columns can keep on the right and easily get past each other.Education to the immaturity leader does not hear from the political managers any pragmatic appeals of this kind.Instead, in Zurich with Simone Brander, a SP "Minister of Velomin" rules that does not drive bike herself because it is too dangerous for her.
Message: The state alone can judge it by investing more in better bicycle paths.This is upbringing to impossibility.Now it is undisputed that Zurich could do more to defuse dangers in the cycle path network.
Even without the preferred routes, to which many parking spaces are sacrificed.Less controversy would be, for example, new signals along important neighborhood roads, where the legal advance applies today.Bicycle drivers ignore this rule because stop-and-go for the muscles is exhausting, unlike an engine.
But more and better ways are not a solution to the problem that cyclists hinder and endanger each other with unpredictable behavior.On the contrary: there will only be a larger number of them.
Because why should the left-green argument that more streets generate more traffic should not apply to Velos?It is not without a recalibration in the spirit of Kennedy: «Ask not, what your City Can do for you...»
Cyclists have to recognize that they also have it in their hands to make a better Velostadt from Zurich.Not by pulling in the head and piercing the rights that you think you have.But by driving with brains.

Veloland begins at Sechseläutenplatz / / Slow-up Zurichsee with a record 41,000 people roles with bicycles and other muscle-powered transport on the right lake shore.
In this form, however, the event is only secured by 2025.Emil Bischofberger (text) and Dominique Meienberg (photos) Moving Velo it feels a little on Sunday afternoon as if you were in the Netherlands or in Copenhagen or in any other place where the bike is number one.
A huge peloton moves on the Seestrasse, which feels like no beginning and no end and moves comfortably along the right shore of Zurich.Mis travelers of all ages are there and people on all conceivable muscle -powered companions.They roll on kickboards, on wheelchairs, on bikes, on skateboards and on Rollski.
However, very clear number two behind the bike travelers are people with inline skates, which is rather surprising, because the once trendy roller shoes otherwise almost completely disappeared from the public.Due to the mix of locomotives and driving skills, the pace automatically levels off at the 20 km / h, which propagate the slow-up organizers as a maximum speed.That fits :
Slow-up bears the slowness in the name, the event describes itself in its official brochure as a "cozy tour and no races".You overtake in the middle of the street.But that doesn't bother the big mass.
On this day there is no space for stress on the street.And above all: no space for noise.The journey feels much calmer and friendlier when you hear the scraps of speech by the fits instead of the roar of the overtaking cars and töffs.
Anyone who needs a break is spoiled for choice in the face of countless stands on the route.There is no pickling, whether temporarily or fixed, in which the Veloparkplatz is not filled.For example at Weinbau Schwarzenbach in Meilen:
There, the Fischchnusperli production runs at 3 p.m. without an interruption. 41,000 people are the mass that, according to the slow-up-ok on this sunny autumn Sunday, rolls the right bank of Zurich with muscle strength.That is a clear record, says Hans Länzlinger, the OK President of the Slow-Up Zurichsee.The Slow-Up series is borne nationally by Health Promotion Switzerland, Switzerland Mobil and Switzerland Tourism.
The extended route has a large proportion of the record participation, for the first time since the first edition in 2004, the slow-up led back to Zurich to Sechseläutenplatz.The organizers of the 2024 cycling World Cup wanted to draw attention to their big event.2024 the Rad World Cup, 2025 again slow-up to Zurichin Grosses Velofest is also planned for 2024.
Then the slow-up fans will have to limit themselves to the original route from the miles: On the same day, the elite racing of the bike World Cup takes place on the section to Zurich.It is at least secured by the WMOK that the Slow-up 2025 will lead again to the Sechseläutenplatz.
What happens afterwards is open."That stands and falls with the sponsors," says Länzlinger, "the securing of the additional route kilometers is a huge financial pants lunch for us." There are very clear number two behind the bike travelers with inlineskates, here on Bellerivestrasse in Zurich Seefeld.Due to the mix of driving skills, the pace automatically levels off at 20 kilometers per hour.

Letters to the editors / / Velo preferred routes in Zurich "Tages-Anzeiger" from September 15th "100,000 new bike spaces for Zurich?" So-called "Velo preference routes" are planned in the city of Zurich.These lead on neighborhood streets through the Tempo 30 zones.
The existing legal in fronts are eliminated, as well as almost all pedestrian strips and traffic calming measures.At the crossings, the plateau increases that brake car traffic and enable a convenient cross for all endors disappear, also with strollers, shopping trolleys and walkers.The only purpose of the renovation measures is to enable bicycle traffic as quickly as possible.
All other interests have to withdraw.The bike preference route planning ignores the requirements of foot traffic and the neighborhood residents after calm neighborhood roads with slow traffic and safe crossings.Fast e-bikes can drive up to 45 kilometers per hour with motor support today.
This is not compatible with the neighborhood.That is why routes for fast e-bikes belong on the main lines and not in the residential areas.Klaus Zweibrücken, Zurichsaur wine in Süssen Häche «Tages-Anzeiger» from September 18th «‹ We have the sale of bunkers

At the moment, our army is not able to fulfill its constitutional mandate ("it defends the country and its population", Art. 58 BV).Apparently, the responsible bodies misjudged the threat situation for a long time.It is commendable that the army chief now names and tries to correct the existing defects.
Süsslis believes that there are "many signs of increasing polarization on our planet".However, it would have to be questioned for state -political reasons whether it would be right to integrate the Swiss army more and more into NATO's power block.It would be more important that Switzerland is involved in building a global security structure with diplomatic means and in a creative way, which contains the political hardening and guarantees a regular-based peace arrangement.

City wants to clear Velos at the train station / / fight against Bernese “Veloleichen” with the opening of the new bike station, the rules have been tightened:
If you leave your bike for too long, you have to expect the police to remove it.Christian Häderlidie challenge that the city of Bern has made itself looks like this: it wants more and more bicycles on the streets and at the same time fewer and fewer bicycles that are parked around the train station in public space.
The strategy with which the municipal management for civil engineering, traffic and city green wants to dissolve this apparent contradiction is: bike stations.At the same time as the opening of the new bike station in the wave 7 ago a little more than a month ago, the city also wanted to go on the offensive when cleaning up around the train station: On the occasion of a one -year pilot project, commuters have been able to do their two -wheelers for 24 hours free of charge in the bike.Place wave 7 and post-parc.
However, this also means that Velos is no longer allowed to park for unlimited time in the entire public space around the train station.A deadline of 24 hours has been on the Bahnhofplatz and Bollwerk.Now the Hirschengraben and on the Schanzenbrücke were introduced.
There, the bicycles have to be gone again after three days at the latest.It has not yet been carried out by the side of the side, which are left longer, can be cleared away.So it is on information boards that the Bern cantonal police recently set up.
If you suddenly no longer find your bike parked at the train station some time ago, you can reclaim it for a fee of CHF 60 - at least for three months.Bicycles that the police have guarded for more than a quarter would be recycled, it says on the posters.So far, however, it should not have been too many people who miss their bicycle at the train station.
Because in connection with the new maximum storage duration, no evacuation has been carried out, according to the municipal management for civil engineering, traffic and city green.With one exception: The upper part of the deer grave was recently cleared after a corresponding announcement by Velos.On the one hand, because the space was needed for an occasion of the nearby ski+Velo center, on the other hand, because chairs and tables are now available to the population.
With the furniture, the city wants to take into account the fact that the Hirschengraben is very popular as a whereabouts for people - especially at noon, the traffic directorate writes.In addition, the bike parking spaces on the Hirschengraben are de facto a provisional: from 2025 at the latest, they will no longer be available, since the space will then be used to build the new station underpass.
The new regulation justifies the city as follows: "It is in the interests of everyone that the short space for bike marking in the station environment is not blocked by" bicycle "." However, it is not just clear "bike oaks" - i.e. bicycles that you can see,that they obviously no longer have a owner - who are to be cleared away.But also bicycles in good condition that have been at the train station for too long.
So that the police can find out which these are, she marks Velopneus with chalk - and thus receives an overview of which bicycles are moved and which are not.Velostation in the wave 7 so far quite empty and what about the newly opened bike station in Welle 7 with its 660 seats?Is this used thanks to the free offer?
From a urban side, it is too early for secure statements, since the station has only been in operation for a good month.However, if you pay a visit to the station, you will find that there is no shortage of space there.
Large parts of the bike storage space are often vacant.Although the familiarization effect for some Bernese is still obviously still failing to exist, the range of bike stations is to be expanded in the next few years.On the one hand, a new station could be created at the generation house.
Up to 2000 two -wheelers should be able to be accommodated there.On the other hand, the capacity of the existing bicycle stations is to be massively expanded.In contrast, the city of Bern wants to proceed:

The bike infrastructure is defective / / by Yvonne Ehrensberger with a “Velo-Knigge” against “Anarcho-Gehab”, the NZZ pushes responsibility for the establishment of a bike city to the people who move with the bike in Zurich (NZZ 22.9. 23).Faced with the challenges of city traffic every day, you feel as a bicycle driver to read your head, because the fact is:
Today's infrastructure does not meet the needs and the feeling of security of the bike travelers.There is a great need for action.The tips for bicycle ranges range from “waving instead of scolding” over clear signs to adapt to speeds.
All of this is entirely justified and correct in terms of content - just like the observation that more and more people are traveling with the bike in Zurich, a very gratifying development.However, the increased number of bicycles clearly shows how the sparse and still dangerously incomplete bike frastructure bursts at the seams.In the article, the behavior on the "bike path" is mentioned in the article - now the reality in the city of Zurich is so that the pure bike paths that are physically separated and secured by car traffic and not designed as a mixed area with foot trafficare still counted on one hand.
In addition, people are pushed to the edge on the bike: both on too narrow wheel strips and through the right -hand driving requirement.This is how you are forced to “prepare”.There are practically no routes on which biking as a social activity would be possible side by side.
Legislation also lags behind the realities in bike: bicycles entitled to manage are still not allowed, and people on the bike are not protected from the risk that emanates from the car.A legally stipulated overtaking distance is still missing.
A relaxed and considerate bike culture on well -developed bike, green waves for bike and hand signals when stopping: we must and may learn from established bicycle cities - absolutely.But please always in the overall context.It is important to differentiate here:
In Zurich the separated bike paths are missing, the green waves are still geared towards the car capacities and speed 50, and for safety reasons you should always be broken with two hands on the handlebar.It shows that the expansion of the infrastructure also comes with bike travelers - and with 11 percent bike content in the city of Zurich, we would do well to significantly increase the bike content.
Unfortunately, Zurich is not well there, especially with regard to diversity among bike travelers: hardly any child drives bicycles here, and older people on the bike are also a rarity.In a real Velostadt, the decision to take the bike is not a test of courage or a statement - but simply everyday.
Consistent and safe bicycle routes are essential for this.We have to work towards this goal - not only because cycling is fun, but also because the movement on two wheels is healthy and good for the planet.What we want from Zurich is an infrastructure on which a relaxed traffic climate can establish itself.
And this is mandatory for a safe and separated bike infrastructure.The speed and the traffic quantities of motorized traffic must decrease.And of course, we should take a deep breath in Zurich, regardless of the means of transportation, and enjoy the beautiful city.

As of today, the city realizes the second bike preference route / / traffic per bike was originally against the project in Seefeld.Now the association is satisfied that it is going forward.
Today the city of Zurich begins with the implementation of the preferred route for Velos on Mühlebachstrasse and Zollikerstrasse in the Seefeld district.Cyclists will largely have a 2.5 kilometer route.It goes without saying that the Velolobby organization Pro Velo welcomes this, but is actually a steering.
Together with the SP two years ago, she had submitted an appeal to the governor's office against the implementation of this route.The dispute had ignited the interpretation of the wording, such routes should be "in principle car -free".Does that mean absolutely or largely without car traffic?
The city continues to allow certain car journeys on these streets.132 Parking space disappears at the time, even traders and residents defended themselves against the implementation, less amazed.
In total, 132 mostly blue parking spaces are lifted for the bike preference route.This corresponds to around two thirds of the current number.All recuries were rejected in February of this year.
And yet per bike is happy, as the organization now writes on request.Last but not least, this has to do with the fact that the decision of the governor's office supports the dismantling of public parking spaces on bicycle preferred routes.The governor's office at the same time stipulates the city council to carry out measurements of the traffic quantities on Mühlebachstrasse and Zollikerstrasse.
If, as feared by Pro Velo and SP, there is actually through traffic, the city council must prevent them with measures.The fear is based on the fact that the legal advance falls away in the preferred routes, which in principle means that you can get forward faster - on the bike, but also by car.The city of Zurich has already focused more on the requirement of not accepting through traffic on these routes, in the planning of the other routes, Pro Velo writes.
In front of school houses, bicycles are slowed down. The implementation of the measures starts today in front of the Mühlebach school building.The Mühlebachstrasse must therefore be blocked in sections by October 21.Also for bike.
The preferred route for bike will be largely ready by the end of the year.The green strip along the street is still missing, which marks bicycle routes in the city of Zurich.This can only be attached in spring due to the weather.
There are several school houses along the bike preference route.So that the children can cross the street more easily, bike traffic is slowed down with ramps.Yvonne Ehrensberger from Pro Velo writes at the request of this editorial team:
“It is important that the preferred routes are now visible and that more of the temporary route is learned with every converted preferred route for the next.»Raps are still possible.The bike preference route in Seefeld is the second that is realized in the city of Zurich.
In spring this year, a three -kilometer piece of street in Altstetten was marked, on which the bicycles are preferred to the cars.The unfamiliar green marking along the lane caused some confusion at the time.That is why the city of Zurich now writes Klipp and clearly: «The cyclists do not have to drive on it and do not keep a minimum distance.»
The green band only serves to orientate.Over the next few months and years, eight further sections for the planned bicycle preferences are to be realized.Five of them are currently blocked by objections.

Everything for the bike is a bad recipe / / Michael from Ledeburin Traffic Questions, you rarely agree in the city of Zurich.But the new traffic regime on Langstrasse, in operation for around two weeks, creates the apparently impossible:
It comes into rejection far into the left camp.The planning flop is too striking, in which the autostau is directed directly into the neighborhood.The cause: the free journey for the bike has been placed on all other interests, about those of automotiveists, pedestrians and residents.
The red-green-dominated city council has created a very complicated traffic routing for an impressive CHF five million.On the Langstrasse, driving ban applies - but only on a distance of 60 meters.This should prevent through traffic.
And at 10 p.m. the regime will be changed: Now the cars can roll again, in contrast to earlier even two-lane.It could hardly be more cumbersome.
With the residents, the work only harvests head shaking.They find that the cars are recently stuck for hours due to the unclear traffic routing when the engine is running.The public transport is also clearly devalued.
The city has removed its own trace on which buses were allowed to run.Now the chauffeurs are in the middle of the Autopulk when it comes to Langstrasse on the weekend.The Langstrasse is far from the only example in which urban traffic planning encounter resistance locally.
In Wollishofen, the city council had to find out that its own red-green voters appear against a planned “bike preference route”.They do not understand why a quiet neighborhood street with Tempo 30 regime is to be converted into a bike highway.For school children, such are by no means safer.
You can dismiss all of this as a small -scale protest on your doorstep.But behind it is a deeper knowledge: the great ideas of the planners make sense on the rice board, but often do not withstand the reality of life in the quarters.
Velo paths do not arise in the empty space, but always at the expense of others.You can feel this in the quarters.This includes that parking spaces in the blue zone are broken down for the construction of bike routes in a large scale, which are primarily used by residents.
The homicide argument against such objections is that the city council only implemented the popular mandate that the population has repeatedly spoken out for bike.But if you talk like this, you will probably make it too easy. "Everything for the bike" sounds good as a slogan and benefits the red-green parties in political marketing.The small print is not supplied with the voters.
Most of them are likely to take the view that more bicycle paths are a good thing, but their construction solve problems instead of creating new ones.There are still enough problems for the bike in Zurich.There are still bike paths that suddenly lead to a expressway.
Such dangerous hotspots should be defused.Intelligent solutions are in demand.But the large rice board plans in Zurich's narrow street space almost inevitably lead to bad compromises.
The city council knew that the new long-road regime would put a strain on neighborhood streets.He was also able to calculate that the bus would be more stuck in the traffic jam.He consciously accepted all of this.
You can see how high the city government weights the bike connection.She unintentionally created an idea that it is the wrong way to subordinate everything to bike.Velo paths do not arise in the empty space, but always at the expense of others.

Nine ETH professors have changed the entire Stadtzürcher street network with their teams, consistently from a bike perspective.By 2025, the researchers want to show what the Zurich transport network of the future could look like and what effects this would have on the environment, traffic and people.Now the first results of the “E-Bike City” project are available.
Study leader Kay Axhausen from the ETH Institute for Transport Planning and Transport Systems says: "We are now ready to be insulted" - and means above all drivers.The declared goal of the project is to make the streets safer for the cyclists.To do this, they accept to make driving in the city more unattractive in order to reach the climate goals.
For this purpose, the ETH experts designed a city in which it is teeming with one-way streets, in which hardly any parking spaces would be found and in return the lanes are designed half for bike, e-bikes and e-trottinette.Public transport would use the previous traces.For comparison: Today, over 88 percent of the street space for cars and parking spaces are reserved.
Just over 11 percent exclusively for bicycles and e-bikes.A city full of one -way streets meant a detour of 25 percent for car drivers according to the researchers' calculations.That is a 5 -minute detour on a car ride of 20 minutes.
Velos and ÖV have planned the traffic researchers in concrete terms: Birchstrasse, the Birchplatz in Oerlikon and the intersection of Winterthurer and Letzistrasse in circle 6. In addition, an interactive map of Zurich has been created that can be explored.The plans each use the previous area of the street.This means that no street would be widened or houses torn down.
For example, the Birchstrasse can be used quickly with temporary pillars and street markings without complex construction work.According to the first results of the study, 37 percent of today's streets could be designed differently for micromobility, sidewalks and green areas.Nevertheless, every building should remain accessible by car.
An adequate range of charging zones and short-term parking spaces ensure the access roads for emergency, delivery and transport vehicles.For the time being, however, only lanes are drawn on the map of the ETH.The intersections are not all noted because you want to wait for the simulations.
However, there is already a example.And the Birchplatz shows the explosive power of the ETH plans.So far, intersections have been done: cars should be able to drive as smoothly as possible.
If it is based on the planners of ETH, public transport and Velos will be ahead in the future.The curve radii for the cars are becoming narrower, the sidewalk for pedestrians wider."Slower traffic means more security for all road users," Axhausen explains the research of the researchers. "Public transport and especially the bike become a much more attractive means of transport through our plans," says Axhausen.
If more and more people decided on a car -free life in the city, parking spaces could also gradually be replaced by green spaces and bike parking spaces, which would also have a cooling effect.The civil engineering office of the city of Zurich writes that the concrete proposal of the Birchplatz intersection is interesting."It shows a consistent solution from the point of view, but from the perspective of the civil engineering office has too little green and residence areas," write the experts.
However, no new city is planned with three sections of the road, which is also clear.The map of the road network is a first interim result."Above all, we want to set the image of the Velostadt in the minds of the people," says Axhausen.
The voting population has confirmed that Zurich should be a bike city in several referendums.By 2040, only every fifth trip in the city by car should take place."The path is still wide, but we are on the right direction," says city councilor Simone Brander (SP). Reservations of the SP City Learning Indie City of Zurich have so far supported the project primarily at a technical level.
Brander emphasizes that the city welcomes the fact that ETH scientifically deal with the transformation of urban space and mobility in the urban context.The civil engineering office also wanted to redistribute the street space, but not only in favor of bicycle traffic, but also in favor of stay, green, foot and public transport."In addition, we have reservations to convert the entire urban area completely into one -way lines," says Brander.
However, the city is looking forward to the end result of the project with regard to the overall performance capability of the transport system and the effects on switching to environmentally friendly means of transport due to the redistribution of the street space.Before-after: Birchstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon is one of the three sections that have already been planned specifically.Visualization: ETH Zurich "Above all, we want to set the image of the Velostadt in the minds of the people."

Study leaders at the Institute for Transport Planning of Ethmarith Planning by ALGORITHMUS2025 want the researchers want to present the final results of the 1.7 million project.The transport system will be subjected to further simulations in nine sub -projects by the end of next year.A team examines how the one -way streets could dynamically adapt: more traces in the city in the morning and more traces out of the city to prevent traffic jams.
Another team programs an algorithm that adapts the timetable to the effective need and also includes personnel planning at the VBZ.Further sub-projects examine whether the CO2 goals with e-bike city are actually achieved, which routes people prefer, how the bauna forms have to be adapted, how accidents can be minimized, how such changes are accepted in the population and whatthe conversion from Zurich to an e-bike city would cost.(Mae)

Anyone who mobes ends up in the no man's / / Antonio Fumagalli, Les Verrières, this is the first adjective to come to mind to the municipality of Les Verrères.If you want to go there with public transport, you will get into the regional train and in Fleurier to the regular bus in Neuchâtel.
The train station has long been shut down.French is located in the west.Exactly makes this seclusion
Les Verrières attractive for the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM).There is a maximum of one month who is no longer portable for a federal asylum center-a time-out in the pampas, so to speak, that should bring the residents to reason.Nine asylum seekers are currently quartered.
The special asylum center (Besoz) was inaugurated in December 2018.It became necessary because in the conventional centers some asylum seekers had massively disrupted or endangered the company due to their renitting behavior - for example by possession of weapons, anesthetic offense or the repeated disregard for the initial ban.Even those who oppose behavioral instructions and thereby annoy or endanger other asylum seekers or the staff must expect exile into the VAL-de-travers.
There is no automatism, the instruction in the Besoz must withstand the principle of proportionality.In other words, the restrictive measure must be suitable to achieve the desired result - and other, less drastic actions must have failed beforehand.Asylum beings on the stop building complex above Les Verrières - it used to serve as a sports center - the fences provided with barbed wire and the surveillance cameras catch the eye.
However, the special center is not a prison.The people accommodated here can move freely, they can simply leave the house between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and are only outside in a perimeter defined by the canton of Neuchâtel.The security measures are significantly increased.
A private security company in the 600-soul village regularly patrollates, which has been known nationwide since the generous admission of almost 90,000 French soldiers in 1871.All of this has its price: Compared to a regular asylum center of the federal government, a bed in Les Verrières costs around seven times more.
The high personnel costs are particularly important.How great the (childcare) effort is for the renitated asylum seekers can be seen in front of the building-which is not accessible to the media and the public-in the parking lot, there are around a dozen cars, many of them with French number plates.
The center has had a short but moving story: In view of the deep asylum figures and the associated bad assignment of the special center, it was closed in 2019 after only nine months for financial reasons - only to reopen it in 2021.This said that security in the other asylum centers has improved noticeably.
Since then, the migration pressure has increased significantly again, the Swiss asylum system is at the attack.The SEM expects around 30,000 applications until the end of the year, the federal centers and the cantons groan.Landabe, container settlements are stamped out of the ground.
Improvement is not in sight: According to the “Sunday view”, the number of unfinished asylum applications is more high than ever.In view of these tensions, it is almost quiet in Les Verrières - or at least not more restless than it is.
Furthermore, the special center is not busy.The average occupancy in the past twelve months has only been six asylum seekers, always men.Fewer assault.
Although there are still over forty verbal disputes between asylum seekers and the staff, the palpable clashes decreased noticeably.In 2021 and 2020 there were fifteen and twenty assaults, it was in 2023 "only" five.For this, the federal government does a considerable effort.
On the one hand, a "de -escalating approach" is used before there are physical conflicts, the SEM writes.On the other hand, the office tries with a whole series of measures to channel the asylum seekers' great aggression potential: there is a space in Les Verrières, which is dedicated to the “calming in the context of activities”.
Those who behave correctly can pass the time with video games in the “play corner”.Last but not least, the asylum seekers take part in employment programs from which the local population should also benefit.The palette ranges from maintenance of water channels to gardening to painting the Bourbaki waggon.
Thanks to such measures, the renitated men should "sensitize" to their traditional centers and no longer trigger turmoil there.The SEM is responsible for security inside the Federal Asylum Centers.What happens outside falls into the area of responsibility of the Neuchâtel cantonal police.
However, the federal government transfers the canton of an “appropriate security flat rate” and pays the patrols of the private security companies.According to the information from the Neuchâtel authorities, the security situation in the region has recently "noticed noticeably".This is also due to the close monitoring by the accompanying group.
In the village, however, the mood is not immediately relaxed.Numerous are the residents who wish the times back when the center served on the outside of the edge of the village and not the accommodation of asylum seekers."When you get into the store, I am always on the hat and stay near the cigarettes," says Pascal Giroud, employee in the only food shop.
Things have already been stolen several times.No pocket money from violent offenses in the community - and there are also the voices that are reminiscent of the historically guaranteed “reception culture” by Les Verrères.However, two things are mentioned several times:
Unlike in the past, you can no longer leave the house and car open.And: Some asylum seekers delinquis because they fear no consequences and have nothing to lose anyway.The SEM vehemently contradicts this assessment.
In the case of violations relevant to criminal law, an advertisement will be made by default, which the known consequences can pull with it.Within the center there are a variety of sanctions - from the ban to enter certain rooms to the refusal of the outcome.The stay in a special asylum center is a punishment in itself, as stricter rules were based there.
In addition to the restricted free time, the non -granting of pocket money is particularly important.And: According to the asylum law, protection seekers are subject to a obligation to cooperate.If you refuse to cancel your asylum application.
It was almost ten years ago that the federal and cantons have promised the construction of special asylum centers for renitate asylum seekers for the first time.Back then, two such centers were operated in Switzerland.The website of the SEM also speaks of it.
But Les Verrières is and remains the only Besoz in the country years later.The canton of Neuchâtel, which also houses the largest federal asylum center in Boudry, is slowly but surely getting on the nerves."We regularly remind the federal government of its obligation to open a second special asylum center outside of western Switzerland," says Laconian on request.
In Bundesbern, the Neuenburg woe would of course seem to be not very urgent.The discussions about a second such center in German -speaking Switzerland are running, writes the SEM."So far, however, no suitable facility has been found." In the asylum center in Les Verrères, stricter rules apply than in conventional accommodation.

Per bicycle defends itself against the reduction of bike strips / / Europabrücke.
The city of Zurich wants to reduce the bike strips at the western end of the bicycle preference route Baslerstrasse."By narrowing the street and km / h, the bike travelers should drive through through traffic themselves, as meat brakes," criticizes the interest association of bicycle travelers in the canton of Zurich Pro Velo.He levies "against this deterioration". "The civil engineering office is reducing existing bicycle frastructure and ignoring the popular will," Yvonne Ehrensberger, Managing Director of Pro Velo Kanton Zurich, is quoted in a corresponding media release.
«If we nod this project, this will be the standard for future bicycle preferred routes.This would be fatal.»Pro Velo Zurich is not per se against the narrow lane, but it is an illusion that motorized private transport can be reduced at this point, not far from the Europabrücke.
The civil engineering office of the city of Zurich wants to dismantle the bike strip at the western end of Baslerstrasse and narrow the road so that no overtaking maneuvers from cars are possible.The existing bicycle frastructure is to be lifted and a narrow lane with three meters of lane and multi -purpose strips is set up per direction.Rushed bike drivers, the city hopes for a traffic calming on this section - and wants to implement the city's bike preference route.
On this idea, per bike is bothered by the fact that the cars would drive the bike in front of them: "The speed of bicycle traffic varies between 15 and 30 kilometers per hour, while car travelers want to drive at top speed," writes Pro Velo.«This means that bicycle travelers feel rushed and unsafe.»
Especially since impatient car travelers would probably try to overtake the bike travelers, which was not intended.Furthermore, it can be assumed that the nodes will occur and bike drivers will also be stuck in the traffic jam - «and not somewhere, but on the first bike preference route» .pro Velo Zurich, however, is not closed to a narrow lane with additional greening, but not, but not,It says in the message."However, only on the condition that through traffic is consistently prevented, for example by bending on and from the Europabrücke in or from Baslerstrasse."
