Federal Council and Parliament want to ensure that the Federal Council and Parliament, Switzerland, want to ensure contemporary framework conditions for civil aviation.The traffic club of Switzerland and Airport protection associations defend themselves against the strengthening of federal competence in air traffic policy and against possible federal loans for infrastructure buildings, so that the Swiss Nervolk decided on February 20 for the first time since 1921 on the air traffic policy at the urn.
Revision in the post -kutschentemposx.The pace of the revision of the Swiss Aviation Act (LFG) is more likely to remain on the era of post -coaches than on that of the jets.The aviation law from 1948 should have been subjected to a total revision in the mid -1970s.
Prof. Werner Guldimann, until 1981 Director of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation and connoisseur of the international air law, delivered a report on Swiss aviation policy on time.However, three years after the publication of this report and an internal administrative consultation, the then head of the EVED refrained from a total revision.A partial revision of the LFG was concentrated with the exclusion of the entire commercial air traffic, which one did not want to tackle with a view to the liberalization of EC air traffic.
In the meantime, the third liberalization package - apart from individual exceptions - came into force in the EC on January 1, 1993, while in Switzerland the partial revision itself is not yet understood almost twenty years after the call for a total revision.This legislative snail pace does not create a suitable framework for an industry that has been shaped by stormy growth for decades.The goals of the Revisions Federal Council adopted the template edited by the Aviation Commission in three readings after an internal administrative consultation in November 1991.
The aim of this revision is contemporary framework conditions for a controlled and environmentally friendly development of Swiss civil aviation.The majority of the revised provisions are undisputed.In the opinion of the Federal Council and Parliament, for example, the transfer of international technical security regulations into state law is simplified.
The flight accident examination experiences a tightening with significantly less bureaucratic effort.The air protection company Swisscontrol receives a clear legal basis.Air passengers are granted better protection:
The activities of commercial air traffic must ensure their liability against passengers.When determining the airport fees, the pollutant emissions of the aircraft must also be taken into account in addition to the previous noise criteria.Instead of the Federal Council, the Federal Supreme Court judges complaints against decisions from the administration regarding airfields and flight safety systems.
The ban on the ultra -light aircraft issued by the Federal Council in 1984 receives a definitive legal basis.Controversial Federal Competence Treatment about the revised Aviation Act essentially focuses on the new Article 37a Undb and 101a, which had already led to an aerial combat in both councils (see box).a uniform jurisdiction of the federal government.
This relocation of competence is justified with the responsibility of the federal government for aviation stipulated in Article 37th of the Federal Constitution.The Federal Council and the vast majority of parliament are of the opinion that in the interest of a uniform and efficient aviation policy, the federal government must also be responsible for the infrastructure systems.Article 37 defines a single, coordinated approval process for public airports (airports) and the other airfields (airfields), which takes the place of various approval procedures on several stages (municipalities, cantons, federal government) and with several ways of complaint.
Cantons and municipalities are only granted a right to hear that should ensure the say and participation of those affected.According to a survey by the Standatean Transport Commission, the large majority of the cantonal governments can put up with this competence delegation in infrastructure systems.The applicable law with unclear allocations and double lanes has even delayed simple infrastructure buildings for aviation over a fee:
So far from the decision to replace the radio fire trasadingen up to its use for ten years.This is just an example of the different speed, with which dynamic airlines on the one hand and officially administrated infrastructure systems develop on the other.The consequences of this divergence are bottlenecks on the ground and in air with chronic delays in air traffic.
Interesting loans for airfields?Politically less stringent than the tightening of the approval and complaint procedures, the promotion of aviation stipulated in Article 101a with the possibility of granting airfields to expand their infrastructures.The construction of the state airports in Zurich, Geneva and Basel was subsidized in 1945 in the sense of a start -up aid with federal contributions of 30 to 35 percent.
In several stages, federal funds of CHF 639 million flowed into the construction of the three state airports. 1984, also at a time tense federal finances, took the parliament from federal contributions for airport buildings and replaced them with loans up to a maximum amount of20 percent of the construction costs.In autumn 1990, Geneva and Basel received low -interest loans of CHF 157 million.These loans were justified with a need to catch up against Zurich.
The revised aviation law now resumes this determination in 1990 and increases the limits from 20 to 25 percent of the construction costs.Paragraph 2 also enables low-interest loans for regional and school airfields.In these loans, the Federal Council and Parliament see - possibly - suitable means to have an appropriate influence on the design of air traffic and the development of the infrastructure.
Based on budget sovereignty, the parliament decides on such loans.Allianz against “Hätschelkind” Air traffic National Council, the revised aviation law in the final vote of June 18, 1993 finally approved 99:44 votes, the Council of States with 33: 4 votes.
Against this law, the Swiss Transport Club (VCS), the Rheinaubund, the protective associations of the airport residents Basel, Geneva, Zurich and the protection association against flight emissions took the referendum that came about on October 4, 1993 with 51 046 signatures.This has to express itself for the first time for over 70 years of the Swiss people at the urn to air traffic policy. "Waste of taxpayers" and "Democracy Dembrance in Air Transport" are the two slogans with which a red-green alliance (environmental organizations, green party, SP, EPP,Protection associations of the airport residents and a.The referendum committee accuses the federal government that it wants to admit legal privileges and additional financial advantages in a time of economic recession and in contradiction to his obligations in favor of the environment of aviation.
The opponents of air traffic are particularly popular with this “subsidization in the traffic of the rich” because subsidies to rail traffic are throttled at the same time, regional lines are switched to bus and the hourly time is thinned out.In the case of prestigious air traffic, the otherwise owed cost truth is not taken literally.The Swiss Railway Association therefore supports the referendum.
For ecological reasons, the referendum committee also wants to force air traffic on tracks up to 600 kilometers on the rails.That is why the committee also defends itself from fundamental considerations against any "subsidy for the most harmful of all traffic".The environmental organizations in particular want to use the only way for a long time for a nationwide debate about the environmental compatibility of air traffic.
Federalistic concerns, even if the red-green camp otherwise does not write the concerns of federalism at the top of its flag, in the case of Article 37a and B it defends itself against "this abolition of federalism".The proposed approval process disempowered cantons and municipalities by taking all the spatial planning skills previously protected by the Federal Court in terms of airfield locations and expansion or restrictions on flight operations.
According to the Federal Constitution, spatial planning is a matter for the cantons.Cantonal popular initiatives for a limitation of air traffic - such as the rejected in Zurich in September 1993 - would no longer be possible with the new Aviation Act.
So far, directly affected regions could have successfully defended themselves against projects with democratic means.With the new procedure in the LFG, those affected would no longer have a weight.According to the referendum committee, the no to the present aviation law is not a no to aviation.
With its unfavorable ecological balance sheet, only the space that he takes into account the truth of the cost should be assigned to this mode of transport.The controversial type of law.37a1
For public airfields, all concerns are checked and decided as part of the concession procedure.There are no additional permits under the Federal Act of June 22, 1979 on spatial planning and according to cantonal law.2 requires the system or operation of a public airfield an approval according to a different federal decree, the license may only be granted if the consent may be grantedthe corresponding approval authority is available.
The decision of the participated authorities forms part of the concession procedure and is opened at the same time as the concession decision.3 Before the concession is granted, the interested cantons, communities and federal positions and the other affected people should be heard;The cantons are heard from the communities and the other affected people. 4
Applications based on cantonal law must be taken into account, provided that the construction and operation of the airport does not hinder the construction and operation of the airfield.
Before the decision on the building permit, the responsible cantonal authority catches up with the approval of the Federal Office.This must be refused if the construction project endangers flight safety or affects airfield operation.The almost the same item 37b regulates the procedure analogously to all other airfields.
Art.101a1 The federal government can grant up to 25 percent of the construction costs to improve or expand the airports Basel-Mülhausen, Geneva and Zurich;

Aircraft crash at Irkutsk / / U. Sd.Moscow, January 3rd, Russian Tupolew 154 Airways Airways Airways moved on Monday at noon shortly after the start in the Eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk.
The total of 111 passengers and 9 crew members, including 17 foreigners, were killed.Citing the Commission for Disaster cases, the agencies reported that the employees of an agricultural business in the crash area had probably been overwhelmed by the falling rubble.The rescue teams sent to the area at minus 20 degrees found no survivors.
The wreckage parts are scattered over a radius of 400 meters.The 17 foreigners should be 10 Germans and 4 Mongols and one Austrian each, Indian and Japanese.The pilots of the three-beamed, in Russia in large numbers in use, in the TU-154 machine, according to the disaster commission, reported shortly after the start that one of the engines had caught fire and the control no longer worked.
The attempts by the crew, the aircraft, failed.The no longer controllable machine quickly lost at height and after a total of 12 minutes flight time near the village of Momona, opened on the floor, went up in flames and then burned out completely.Overloaded, poorly maintained machine dining air safety in ex-Soviet space has been decreasing for some time.
In most cases, however, the cause of the crash is not due to technical defects, as in this case, but to overload the aircraft.Especially in the outskirts, especially in the Caucasus, security has to make room for mercantile interests: south of the Elbrus there is no more course flight that would not be completely overloaded, and the sight of the pilot or other employee who brieflyA hundreds of thousands of rubles facilitate the departure of a crowding group of black pilots, they have already got used to it in those areas of the country.
It is not uncommon for tons of illegal freight to be promoted on passenger flights.It is also saved on the scarce and expensive fuel anyway.According to western aviation experts, the aircraft are also generally worse than before.

Billion program for airport expansion / / Zurich Airport must be adapted to the rising traffic volume in the second half of the nineties.The airport partners provide for a construction program with an estimated CHF 2 billion investments, of which around CHF 800 million would be eliminated on the canton.
The application for a framework credit template that is subject to the referendum is to be submitted to the government council this summer.As the Information Service Airport Zurich (IFZ) reports, representatives of the airport partners have dealt with the project organization for the expansion of the airport, which is necessary because individual areas are already used to the limit of performance during the peak times.The capacity is particularly exhausted in the aircraft stands;
The result is delays and an unnecessary burden on the environment with airplanes from aircraft that have to wait until a stand becomes free.But the number of switches for passenger clearance is also insufficient, which always leads to overcrowded terminals.In the future, in view of the increasing demand, an orderly operation can no longer be guaranteed in the future, which would be associated with serious negative consequences for the economy of the canton of Zurich and Switzerland, the IFZ press release says a further expansion stagetherefore required.
Finger dock “Midfield” and Bahnhof terminal wächche should contain this stage, the airport partners “roughly” determined.These are around 30 new aircraft parking spaces in the so -called Midfield between the slopes, 60 to 80 temporary switches in a new terminal, which is to be incorporated into the airport station as an underground supplementary construction.Then the expansion program includes central de -icing stations for aircraft on the starting thresholds of slopes 28 (western slope) and 16 (blind landing slopes) and the supplement of the roller paths to these starting waves through track waves that allow the order of the aircraft to be changed at short notice when itis necessary for reasons of airspace management.
The planned plane parking spaces in the “Midfield” include a new finger dock with waiting rooms for the passengers.For the aircraft, the advantage of short roller paths at the start or after landing results.On the other hand, the paths for the passengers are longer;
For you and the luggage, an underground connection between the airport head and the new finger dock is intended.According to the IFZ, the handling in the new station terminal would significantly increase the comfort for the passengers arriving by train, which should lead to an "increased change from private transport to public transport".Still very rough cost estimate
Processed expansion package is a joint work of the airport partners, namely the canton of Zurich as an airport holder, the Swissair, the Airport Immobilien Society (FIG) and the SBB.Preliminary costs of around CHF 2 billion, which are still very roughly known as “still very rough” cost estimates,, according to today's assessment on the canton, around CHF 800 million, about CHF 1,000 million, the Swissair CHF 150 million and SBB 50 millionFrancs are omitted.The voters will have to decide on the investments of the canton of Zurich.
The commissioning of the individual objects can only be expected after the turn of the millennium.There are currently no preliminary projects for the individual buildings.At the end of last year, the government council spoke a preparatory loan of CHF 1.3 million so that the preparation work for the creation of a corresponding loan application can be taken by hand.
Fig, Swissair and SBB also provide loans for the planning work.Preparation steps have processed the airport partners at a conference at the invitation of government councilor Hedi Lang, director of the economy, key problems of the planned expansion, which includes the questions of financing, the public and private traffic, environmental compatibility and company-designing requirements.The government council is proposed to use a project commission to be assumed in which the airport partners are represented.
It is to be managed by the airport director.In the summer of this year, the government council is to be submitted for a framework credit template of the cantonal council.The last word will have the voters.

State funds and job cuts to save the TAP-Air / / Les.Lisbon, 18. Januardie of enormous losses plagued state Portuguese airline TAP (Transportes Aereos Portugueses) is to get back on its feet thanks to the powerful state aid and a stopping program.
The company's general assembly blessed a renovation plan, which by the end of 1997 a state financial injection of 180 ESC.(CHF 1.5 billion) and a reduction of a quarter of the positions.Transport Minister Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral wants to fly to Brussels this month, because the plan must be approved by the Commission of the European Union because it is a state subsidy program.
The TAP-Air continues to expect red numbers until 1995.A record loss of up to 34 billion ESC awaits you for 1993 alone., and according to a spokesman for the company, the total loss in 1995 is likely to be around 170 billion ESC.Achieve, i.e. just less than the government is ready.The renovation of 180 billion ESC.
is to be brought in four tranches, with 50 billion ESC for the current year as the first payment.are planned.In 1996 TAP hopes to be able to write black again for the first time since 1973.
By 1997, the workforce of around 9,500 people is also to be reduced to around 7100 employees.800 jobs should be eliminated this year.The wage costs remain open during the term of the renovation plan, because negotiations with the unions are also planned.
However, the company management excludes any increase in real wealth until 1997 and wants to adhere to government policy, which for the time being wants to freeze wages for the national workers in 1994.As part of the plan, the fleet of the TAP is to be reduced from 37 to 32 passenger machines.Four new Airbus 340 - 300 are already included in this invoice, which should arrive by spring 1995.
All machines of the current fleet are leased and the four will be the first effectively bought TAP aircraft.As a further saving measure, some lines regarded as secondary are to be set.This includes the connections Faro-Geneva, Faro-Frankfurt and Lisbon-Nizza-Stuttgart as well as flights after all destinations in the United States with the exception of New York.

The referendum against the revised aviation law / / questions about the operation of the regional airfields is not at the center of the revision of the Aviation Act, which the sovereign has to coordinate on February 20.Nevertheless, the resistance to the template is largely motivated by the discomfort about "reinforcement of the airfield density in Switzerland", as the referendum committee writes in the voting.
Altenrhein airfield, a private airfield with minimal line traffic volume, and especially the years of legal dispute over the installation of an instrument landing system (ILS) illustrate some aspects of the problem.Altenrhein, in the Januardie response to the question of the extent to which the revised aviation law will influence today's and future operation on Altenrhein airfield, is very different, depending on whether it is organized in the airfield, FFA Airport Altenrhein AG, or anti -airfieldLocal "action against aircraft noise" (AGF) and in the Swiss protection association against flight emissions (SSF)."No to minimal changes" is the opinion of the former;
The anti -airfield, on the other hand, speaks of a massive deterioration in the legal position of the local communities and residents.The statements reflect the dispute between the two parties - and in Altenrhein for years, currently for a general operating permit for the instrument landing system (ILS) installed since 1991. "Fantastic utilization" The discussion is only understandable if Altenrheins is briefly usedis received.
The place with the status of a private airfield is a work flight at the FAFA aircraft workser Altenrhein AG, houses a flight school, serves the gantry and the demand air trip and is also regularly used by the Swiss Air Traffic School SLS and for courses in aviator (FVS) on behalf of the federal government.In addition, the Austrian airline Rheintalflug has been connected to Vienna in line with Vienna since 1991, three times a day since September 1993.The 37 -placed and undisputed amount of noise turbo potentios
According to the information from managing director and founder Rolf Seewald, dash 8ist is currently 76 percent - a dream value, as he says.In 1993 a good 30,000 passengers were promoted between Altenrhein and Vienna-Schwechat, the company's turnover with 75 employees was around 160 million Schilling.Seewald expects a positive annual financial statements, which, after problematic years, is also urgently needed to put the Rhine alcohol on a healthy basis.
The good demand for the Vorarlberg federal capital air connection is primarily attributed to the barely competitive railway offer of the route at the Rhine Alflower - at least for those travelers who have to charge the time required.The journey takes over 16 hours back and forth.At the same time, the Swissair morning course Zurich-Wien is not accessible by train.
The way to the three daily flights of Altenrhein-Wien was long and arduous for the Rhine alarm.This is related to the elaborate approval procedures for the corresponding license.After the company, founded in 1984 in 1984, initially set up a modest regular Vienna traffic from Hohenems with six-level aircraft, the modest dimensions of the airfield there countered an expansion.
The state of Vorarlberg initially supported the expansion plans because the airfield communities opposed it.As early as 1984, the Rhine alcoholic flight for a Swiss line concession for the Altenrhein-Wien route (Altenrhein had a 1,300 m long slope).Because the St. Gallen government council expressed the opinion of the St. Gallen government, there was no public interest in such a connection, there was no decision by the responsible department.
After a survey of the airfield, the Echo was positive, the St. Gallen government changed its opinion two years later, but wished, among other things, to 43,000 flight movements (in 1986 there were 46,000, 55,000 in the previous year).In 1988 the concession was given by the Federal Transport and Energy Industry Department (EVED), of course with a number of requirements.A state contract with the Austrian position of Altenrhein airfield directly on the national border complicated things.
The condition was linked to the line concession that an instrument landing system had to be set up.This required the construction of an airfield control zone (CTR), which also expanded across Austrian territory.With a “Gentlemen's Agreement”, which culminated in 1991 in a Swiss Austrian state contract, in which the noise pollution was frozen by a complicated point system at the value of 1988 (43,000 flight movements), the cliff was finally to be avoided.
In March 1991, the EVED gave the airfield holder to the provisional operating permit for the now built ILS for six flight movements every day, which made the Rhine alcoholic flight possible to record the line connection from Altenrhein after she had previously flown to Vienna for a year and a half from Friedrichshafen, with a seat utilization of only 30% up to 35 %, however, had brought in high losses.Against the limited and provisional ILS operating permit, the airfield opponents were received by the Air Pregnance of Airfield, which were rejected by the EVED in 1992.There was several recurrence against the withdrawal of the suspensive effect of the symptoms to the Eved, then to the Federal Council and at the same time to the Federal Court;
The state government decided against the complainants after a non -entry decision by "Lausanne".The dispute continued.In 1993 the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) issued the FFA Airport
Altenrhein the general operating permit for the ILS, but without withdrawing the suspensive effect in any case with a complaints.The Bazl justified its decision by name by the fact that the St. Gallen location cantonal had clearly spoken out in the broad -based interrogation procedure for the granting of the permits;
He had expressed the opinion that the environmental impact report, which was submitted by the applicant and created by the Federal Office for the Environment, Forest and Landscape (Buwal) with a bird protection reservation, was a compatible basis for the assessment of the request of the airfield operator.The ILS has been generally useful since Monday of this week after the eved has protected the appeal of Airport Altenrhein AG and withdrawn the suspensive effect (comparisons NZZ No. 14).Materiellist, however, still pending.
Gegenge the «Airport Ost»?Why the presentation of these years of right -handed law?Because they fog up one of the main areas that serve the referendum committee as arguments against the aviation law revision.
With Article 37b (Approval for Airfields), which is based on the fact that, within the framework of the federal law approval procedure, it would be decided on the location, size and scope of the airfield as well as all aviation -specific concerns, says, for example, Elias Stieger, secretary of the protection association against flight emissions thatCantons and communities deprived of their influence on airfield planning issues.According to new law, nothing could be done against it if "the Bazl compulsion is forced to do so until (in Altenrhein) the Ost Airport has become essential".Even a point that would actually have to be debited in this optics and with such a pronounced enemy image from the Bazl on the property, that according to the revision and the Federal Court and the Federal Council no longer decides on symptoms regarding airfields and air protection systems, Stieger is on theMinus page beaten:
This is a intimidation of the citizen, he says, the threshold is then too high.In doing so, he gets involved in contradictions in that the anti-airfield opponents, for example, the negative decision of the EVED to restore the suspensive complaint with the temporary ILS company permit Funfach at the same time to the Federal Council and the federal court.Urs Adam, head of the infrastructure department and airspace in the Bazl, contradicts Stieger.
The new article 37b does not want to rob the cantons and communities of their rights of cooperation.Unlike according to today's legal condition, the aim is, with its up to three parallel procedures with different legal remedies, which often blocked each other, an efficient and transparent procedure that leads to appropriate decisions of an instance (most recently of the Federal Court).The basic features of the railway law are taken.
In addition, the federal government cannot simply ignore cantonal guidelines and usage plans.The federal government in Altenrhein has never granted something against the will of the canton of St. Gallen.As far as the ghost that is liked by airfield opponents, “Airport East” is concerned with exuberant traffic, the state contract with Austria with its “extremely tight noise corset” is the best guarantee against it;
A change of status from the airport to the airport, a second Lugano Agno, would make a change in this contractual contract, which, according to the experience, could be excluded.The last Hunterffa overall leader Charles Brönimann is primarily important for the ILS, because the Altenrheiner aircraft works with around 100 employees after the omission of the army orders - in December 1993 the last maintained Hunter fighter aircraft left the area increasingly to demandingMaintenance orders want to avoid business travel frames.Although he has recently had a reassurance on the front because it is apparently recognized that "Altenrhein is a serious airfield", he regrets that the opposition simply ignores improvements that the new law brings.
This includes that in addition to the noise, the pollutant emissions must also be taken into account when determining the airfield fees.To the defendant reduction of democratic rights, Brönimann says that the airfield opponents overused this argument: for the municipal building permit procedure for the ILS in Altenrhein, nobody was interested in it, and not a single objection was received.

Federal votes / / by Werner Guldimann, Uitikon Waldeggder Author of this contribution at the end of the 1970s as director of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation gave the impetus to the revision of the Aviation Act (LFG) and was involved in the revision work after his retirement.The present explanations give his personal opinion back on the two main points that are asserted by the opponents of the template and concern Article 37 and 101a.
Delay not generally of interest to Articles 37 and 40, the double lanes and difficulties are eliminated in favor of a coordinated only approval process.This corresponds to a claim that was raised in a decision by the Federal Court in parliament as in 1990 (individual data in the Federal Council).For flight safety systems and airports - as in railway law - exclusive federal responsibility is created, for airfields a cantonal building permit procedure is maintained for everything that does not affect location, size and scope of use.
In both categories, an adequate right of say and participation of those affected, in particular the cantons and municipalities, is ensured.In principle, requests based on cantonal law must be taken into account.The last complaint is no longer the Federal Council, but the Federal Supreme Court.
What is eliminated with this is the possibility of delays and delays, such as that can be illustrated using the example of the renewal of the Trasadingen shooting radio.It is understandable that those interested in the tightening of the procedure are not pleased with such delay and delay options.One can doubt that your opposition is in general.
Incidentally, the revision template is by no means based on limiting the position of the cantons;On the contrary, it is strengthened in other provisions.So the Federal Council can.51 para. 3 authorize the cantons to take measures to reduce environmental pollution and the endangerment of people and things on earth.
A second: So far, approval by the Federal Office was reserved for the fees of public airfields;According to Art.39 para. 1 takes a mere supervision in their place, which would probably only have to intervene against arbitrariness or against violating international regulations.On the possibility of subsidizing the second main point of opposition, Article 101a lies the template.
This authorizes the federal government for granting (1) amortization and interest rate loans up to 25 percent of the construction costs to the improvement or expansion of the three state airports and (2) interest-bearing loans up to 25 percent of the costs for the construction, the furnishings, improvement orThe expansion of regional airfields.This is undeniably a subsidy option.However, their scope is, compared to the federal government's obligation to contribute, under the federal decision of 1945 on the expansion of civil airfields, which had to cover around a third of the construction costs for the state airports and thus came to hundreds of millions - and very modestly even more modestCompared to the (failed) overall transport concept of 1977, which wanted to sign the federal government of national importance to take over the planning, construction and maintenance of the infrastructure of the transport network - including the state airports.
The size may be two to three percent of the costs in question, i.e. with a volume of a hundred million, by two to three million francs.The proportions of Wahrenlauf This size of magnitude would like to point out the Swiss Railway Association in particular, which is particularly strong for the opposition against the template.From Article 3a of the Federal Railway Act of 1943, which commits the federal government to take over the depreciation, interest and structural maintenance of the infrastructure and frees the (belonging) SBB from any taxation by cantons and communities, there is nothing to know there.
According to the 1994 budget, SBB should receive operating contributions of 830 and infrastructure contributions of 1320 million, together more than 2 billion (without the operating accounts).The budget provides for expenses of 6.6 billion for all traffic, 324 million of them.That is 15 percent of the contributions to SBB and less than 5 percent of the total traffic expenses.
Of the 324 million mentioned, 256 million are exposed to air traffic control;Of these, 176 million are covered by fees.Sure, the 324 million are not insignificant and any interest rate benefits make up something;
In the assessment, however, you should keep the proportions.In connection with this, the opponents raise the demand for truth.You can join her;
For them, however, the internalization of the external costs of all modes of transport would be much more important and much more important.Incidentally, the critical financial situation of the federal government cannot be assumed that the possibility “can” be very quickly exploited.The revised legislative provisions will not only be made for the next few years, but will also apply far into the 21st century.
With reference to both articles, the opposition claims that it is disassembly of federalism, and intended is an immensely expansion of air traffic.However, this argument is excessive, and there is no better example of impossible example than the uncomfortable popular initiative "for a massive air traffic", which came from the same kitchen and has been significantly rejected by the people.The opponents claim that if the template is rejected, they could be transferred very quickly into a reduced version and that they could also be passed by parliament as quickly as possible.
However, this would require that such a corresponding priorities were granted both by the Federal Council and Parliament.The reality should look different.Another queue of a few years would be more likely, especially if one takes into account that the revision of the provisions about commercial aviation is becoming more and more urgent.

Shrinked sales of the Boeing / / Gn.New York, January 24, Boeing Col.
In Seattle / Washington in 1994, a profit of $ 394 million or $ 0.89 per share shown for the final quarter - a result that is above expectations.The turnover decreased from $ 7.50 billion to $ 5.66 billion.
The profit of 1.54 billion fell to $ 1.54 billion or from $ 4.57 to $ 3.66 per share per share.The turnover turned to 25.44 (i.V. 30.18) billion.When comparing the quarterly and year figures, it must be taken into account that the information for the previous year does not contain the one-time adaptation to new balance sheet guidelines for the evaluation of pension margin services ($ 1.00 billion or $ 2.95 per share).
In the annual financial statements, factors, on the one hand a lower paragraph of commercial aircraft, persistently high research and development expenses as well as weaker investment income are reflected and on the other hand a higher degree of customer financing and increased armaments and space applications.The administration is optimistic about the long -term prospects on the world aircraft market and also about the chances of defending their market share.The weakening at the civil aircraft market is shown in the decline of the planes delivered in 1993 from 441 to 330.

New structures for the civil aviation in Eastern Europe / / by Gerhard Stadler, Vienna*The civil aviation of the former socialist states of Eastern Europe is in a profound structural change.
Their importance for the economic upswing is undisputed, and the forecasts predict their above -average growth.However, developments are also determined that fear that this growth could lead to great difficulties for some areas of civil aviation that could also have a negative impact on Western European airlines.The civil aviation in Eastern Europe is also in -depth change in a period.
The unity of the Ministry of Transport, the only airline, airports and air traffic control, which is common in the socialist states, will be resolved;The airlines and airports -free management -free management are planned, but no state is realized.The air traffic geared almost only on connections within the Comecon (and with friendly states of Africa and Asia) is now based on how the entire economy and society to Western Europe.Due to the collapse of Intra-Comecon traffic and the only slow construction of the connections to Western Europe, the number of passenger numbers of the eastern airlines and airports has declined in recent years;
The passenger numbers of western companies to Eastern Europe rose disproportionately.Priority for the air traffic For the next few years, traffic between Western and Eastern Europe is predicted above average growth of more than 10 percent per year.Since traffic air trips are decisively shaped by the economic development of a region, the progress of these forecasts will depend on the economic upswing in Eastern Europe and the intensification of economic relationships between Western and Eastern Europe.
The ground traffic connections with and in Eastern Europe are inadequate.The distances are great, the traffic against crime is difficult to protect, motorways hardly existent, although railway lines for heavy goods- but not for fast passenger train traffic, you can see from the Vienna Budapest route.There are projects for improvements to the soil traffic infrastructure, but they are more time and cost, so that the political planning of improvement in air traffic is high.
Improvement of the airport infrastructure of the airport network of Eastern Europe is tight: Hungary, like the population, has about twice as large as Switzerland, 11 civil airports with ride over 2500 m in length and another 7 military airports.In all countries, numerous solid -equipped airports were given up by the Air Force and were now available for civilian purposes.
The rest of the infrastructure of all airports in Eastern Europe, on the other hand, is poorly decreasing: there are neither enough handling capacities for international passenger and freight traffic, nor underground traffic connections or in the vicinity of the airports hotels, conference and business centers.Domestic flights that used to be very cheap are practically only available in the Russian Federation.
International traffic is almost exclusively limited to the airports of the capitals.There is hardly any international regional flight traffic according to the western pattern (which can also be reached 140 km away, which can also be reached after the UN sanctions, which cannot be reached after the UN sanctions), Ostrava, Krakov, Wroclav, Varna (in summer charter traffic).The economic and social decentralization, which has been determined since the end of the socialist planned economy, will undoubtedly follow the inclusion of a larger number of non-capital airports in international traffic.
The airports of the capitals are modernized with western know-how (e.g. Lufthansa in Bucharest and Moscow; by Amsterdam Airport in Prague) or financial aid (the EBRD, from EC programs).The fact that the traffic expectations for 2015 are sometimes dominating the plans and not those for 2000 is certainly not beneficial to the profitability calculation of such projects.
The fees, previously an average of two thirds lower than Western European airport tariffs, will soon increase if the state no longer wants to or can no longer pay the grants necessary to operate the airports and the loan repayments are due.The first environmental protection movements against the often city-close and 24-hour airports have emerged and hinder their expansion (e.g. Sofia).Budapest, Prague and Warsaw compete for the role as a hub (hub) for Eastern Europe.
International forecasts assess such intentions very skeptical about the further intra-osteuropean traffic.Even in the long term, Vienna and Frankfurt should remain the most important transfer points to Eastern Europe with around 200 weekly departures.Too many air society ends in the socialist era with monopoly -equipped national airlines are independent or privatized and open to international capital.
With around 30 percent Air France each participated in the CSA and Alitalia on the Hungarian Malev, Tyrolean Airways holds 50 percent in the new Albanian Airlines.Crossair's participation in the Slovak Tatra Air ended in 1993.The renewal of the fleets of the airlines is going faster than expected thanks to the very cheap used aircraft market, and soon the Boeing 737 and 727, which are mostly operated on the basis of “wet lease” (with the rental of pilots and maintenance), will be replaced by the loud tupolevhave, at least in traffic with Western Europe.
Larger procurement programs for Airbus 310, 320, Boeing 767, ATR 72 and a.have started.This is intended to offer western societies to be in terms of business travel traffic.In addition to the “Flag Carriers”, an already unmanageable number of private airlines has been created in the past two years:
One or more aircraft, which are mostly cast by the state companies, some excmilitative pilots, an imaginative name, and the flights are recorded.Licenses are likely to be easy to get from the aviation authorities, an examination of the financial performance should not be carried out and a company and technical supervision is unlikely.These companies are by no means only nationally or regional, they also occur in intercontinental transport:
There are regular flights from Eastern European capitals to East Asian shopping centers, from where travelers can home with computer, photo and hi-fi goods and, from the difference between the entry and sales price of the goods, can easily finance the ticket.Some of the societies have already disappeared or were renamed, others have been involved in non -clarified accidents, so that there are uncertainty factors.But a rule of international air traffic law generally obliges other countries to recognize the licenses and registrations issued by the home states.
Fragmentation of the flight protection?The national fragmentation of the flight protection, which is understandable from European history and today, which is severely obstructed by Western European air traffic, which now has to be laboriously overcome by the European Civil Aviation Conference and EuroControl in order to reduce the "overload and cost-increasing airspace", is also threatened by Eastern Europe.National prestige, military objections and the sales arguments of the manufacturers of flight control facilities lead to an uncoordinated development of air traffic control in the small states of Eastern Europe with high investment costs.
Although these can be refinanced and via international financial institutions via flight protection fees, they increase the costs for the users of airspace without improving flight safety and lead to resolution problems.When intensifying air traffic via Eastern Europe, this development would lead to the same problems, from which today the Western European flight protection and the airlines suffer.The “Ceats” project (Central European Air Traffic Services) is looking for this development:
Seven states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and, for its northeastern area, Italy, consider a joint control center for their upper airspace with use of the air protection installations that are available in the individual states or are still coordinated.In 1994 a political decision is to be made.Another problem associated with air traffic control is that several Eastern European countries do not belong to the ICAO transit.
This makes it possible for you to request prices for the country that go far beyond the cost of air traffic control and put a strain on Western European companies on their East Asia flights.Does the aerospace industry have a future?The commitment of the Comecon countries not to procure western aircraft favored the civil aviation industry of the USSR.
Forecasts say that Eastern Europe will need 2000 commercial aircraft as a replacement of the outdated aircraft in the next 15 years.However, it is likely that these procurements will be made from western manufacturers.There are prototypes of Tupolev 204 and Ilyuschin 96 equipped with western engines to at least reduce fuel consumption and noise development of Russian aircraft, but it is doubtful whether such models in Eastern Europe can prevail against western providers.
For some special tasks, aircraft of eastern production of western tree patterns prove to be quite equivalent, such as large -scale freight (Antonow 124) or with heavy helicopters.For example, the urgently needed photogrammetric admission of the Viennese Stephansdom with a helicopter kamov 32 t of a temporary leased by an Austrian company took place perfectly.Russian aircraft have not yet been approved in Western European countries.
Problems here are the documentation only existing in Russian and the not FAA-compliant tests.For the same reasons, efforts to achieve the model approval of the JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities), which is necessary for the exports of new types to Western Europe in the future, have so far been unsuccessful.However, since the eastern aircraft construction is constructive, mechanically and manufacturing technology at a high level, there could be supply deliveries for western aircraft manufacturers and for the outsourcing of maintenance work into these cheaper countries.
The legal framework condition of national aviation laws in the Eastern European countries are currently being revised in order to adapt the legal framework to the more liberal and market economy basic ideas, which also includes more options for developing.The bilateral air traffic agreements are also liberalized in numerous negotiations, but in case of doubt, the protection of national companies is still strongly emphasized.A fundamental change would occur through the implementation of the "European Convention", which the EC has already completed with several Eastern European countries.
Air traffic is included in them.In implementation agreements, the principles of the so-called three «EC Air Transport Liberalization packages» from 1989-1992 are also to be binding for civil aviation with the Eastern European countries.This would also include free market access, the ban on subsidies and the duty of supervision on the financial and operational management of the airlines.
The international aviation organizations ICAO, ECAC and Eurocontrol have started with support programs, but in some places the organizational, linguistic and personnel requirements have to be created so that the Eastern European civil aviation can secure the usual standards in Western Europe.* The author is head of the Supreme Civil Aviation Authority and Vice President of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), Paris.
1994
Confederation of February 20 / / for the first time in over seventy years, the people are called to comment on the urn on Swiss aviation policy.The referendum has been taken against the slowly concluded partial revision of the Aviation Act under the red-green side under the leadership of the Switzerland traffic club (VCS) (see NZZ No. 1 and 16).
The following two contributions illustrate the opposite viewpoints: National Councilor Ueli Fischer (FDP., Aargau) justifies the fearful attitude of the Federal Council and parliamentary majority, while VCS Central President Matthias Zimmermann explains the arguments of the opponents of this legal revision.Contemporary
Regulation of the air traffic von National Councilor Ulrich Fischer (FDP., Aargau), Seengen with great more.The revision is limited to the most urgent concerns, while other innovations, which were also desirable, have been put back in order to minimize the risk of delays.Most of these revision points are undisputed.
The referendum was taken because of the two controversial areas that have been used to provide regulations on the approval process and that about the possibility of granting interest rates.Basic opponents of aviation consequently combat all provisions and advance that make this type of traffic easier.Whether the reasons of ecology and federalism mentioned to justify the rejection are the real motives or whether these are not to be found in a fundamental, fundamentalist preventive strategy may be left to the case.
In any case, the fact remains that the opponents of the revision strive for an difficulty and reduction in air traffic with their opposition.In contrast, the supporters want to enable the federal government with the new provisions in addition to the guarantee of increased flight safety to perceive its constitutional leadership role in the wording and implementation of a total Swiss aviation infrastructure policy.Simplification of the approval process experience shows that in Switzerland larger buildings, especially those in the public interest, can only be realized after a long, exhausting hurdle run via numerous authorization.
The resulting delays and reductions in our economy and are detrimental to the maintenance and creation of an optimal infrastructure to a large extent.For these reasons, the realization has become more and more established in recent years that the approval procedure for tightening and simplification, especially for works in the national public interest, has to be reorganized and, if the corresponding constitutional competence, the federal government must be concentrated.The planning approval process for railway size projects was re -regulated in 1991, which will now be used at Bahn 2000 and Neat.
In the same sense, the aviation law is based on species.37 ter BV, a concession or approval process for airports and airfields at the federal government.In the future, the federal government should check all interests within the framework of these procedures, so that no additional permits according to the federal law on spatial planning and according to cantonal law are no longer required.
After all, the say in interested cantons, municipalities and affected people is fully guaranteed.If the system or operation of the airfield requires the approval according to another federal decree, the concession or permit may only be granted if the corresponding approval authority is approved.With this concentration of the approval procedure at the federal government, the desired simplification and acceleration is made by avoiding duplications, confusion, difficulties with the delimitation of competence and different complaints in favor of a coordinated procedure.
The demand for manageable approval procedures without a smear at the legal protection interest of those affected can be optimally taken into account.Modest financial participation of the federal reverse of the resumption of the federal government in 1984, interest and amortization-efficient loans to the costs for the construction, the facility, the facility, improvement or expansion of airfields up to the maximum limit of 25 percent was granted at the second significant crystallization point in theDispute of this legislative revision.With this provision, the federal government is able to support the expansion of our intercontinental airports Basel -Mülhausen, Geneva and Zurich in the interest of our position in international air traffic - even if in a modest framework.
In addition, such loans can also facilitate flying and further education for financing infrastructure systems.The opponents of the revision assert in connection with these provisions, so that “funds for air traffic” could be “bubbled”, which contrary to all principles of railway traffic would also be competed.This approach passes the realities.
Compared to the billions, which are spent on the part of the federal government to expand and maintain rail transport annually, the conceivable contributions are extremely modest for the air traffic infrastructure.The fear that this would compete with this would be absurdly appears after the railway has rightly regained market shares after the railway in the area of European short and medium-haules, thanks to improved infrastructure.Incidentally, it is a manner provision that allows it to check in each individual case whether such a loan is practical and justified.
The federal government can also influence the design of the infrastructure of our aviation.The possibility of granting loans therefore proves to be a very conformed management instrument of Swiss Aviation Policy.Functional
Revisionpaketal inland, Switzerland is more dependent on well -functioning and efficient air traffic than ever.With the revised aviation law, the prerequisites are improved or re -created so that it can be handled as optimally as possible from the aspects of security, ecology and economy.The present revision therefore deserves a significant assumption.
Anachronistic subsidy von Matthias Zimmermann, Langenbruck*The demand for truth - every mode of transport bears his direct and external costs - is now recognized as a market economy steering instrument in the professional world and in politics.It basically promotes raw material-saving and safe traffic, that is, its environmental and social compatibility.
State subsidies - unless they are gaps up to the extensive introduction of the principle of truth - disrupt this mechanism and are therefore to be rejected.It is all the more incomprehensible that the new aviation law, despite the opposite fundamental decision of the Federal Councils in 1984, reinstates interest -bearing loans from the federal government for airfield buildings and fields.- While Swiss road traffic, according to the new road calculation just published, only covers its direct costs 73 percent (23 of them fuel duties), flight petrol is even completely tax -free for cross -border flights:
This is another hidden subsidy for air traffic of around one billion Swiss francs per year.And we are already reading from an 800 million contribution from the Canton of Zurich to Kloten Airport.- In order to go to the way to the cost of the cost, the soft, which is immediately in front of us, must not be made incorrect, otherwise all later measures are of little use.
Dusted centralism of the newly intended approval process disempowers cantons and municipalities of their say in terms of airfield locations and expansion as well as regulation of flight operations;It also opens the locks for excessive helicopter and ultra-light aircraft traffic.According to the new law, the flight enthusiastic and the central Federal Office for Civil Aviation will soon roll out a “flying noise carpet”, because in its opinion, short -haul traffic should grow by a factor of 2.6 in 16 years.
Above all, the important “export industry” tourism will have little understanding, since it has recognized the signs of the times and newly switched to “gentle”.- In addition, European decision -makers of various provenance are increasingly inquired of the functioning of Swiss federalism after the principle of subsidiarity has begun to arouse interest in the Maastricht Treaty.The future is not called centralization, but subsidiarity, i.e. modern federalism against the attitude "Die-Da-Aben-Ja-Sowieso-Was-sie-sie". On the rail!
It is obvious that the simultaneous provision and the maintenance of various parallel transport networks such as rail, road and air traffic cannot be financed - the dream of free choice of the means of transport has finally turned out to be priceless.The safest, most reliable, overall cheapest and at the same time environmentally friendly means of transport, the rail, is to be preferred as far as possible.This is the most important step in fulfilling the obligations from the climate concept of the Earth Summit in Rio 1992, which was signed by Switzerland.
- In general, it is absurd to compete in large investments in the European long -distance rail network such as the NEAT, the cervical tunnel, TGV, ICE etc. by promoting air traffic again.- Lack of time and stress traveling business people will soon switch to the European night train network with better and more pleasant city connections.Jobs for the Swiss Reason for the growth figures recently published by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, one has to assume that the civil aviation must be a successful industry.
It is therefore not to be seen why it should still receive subsidies with short -available public sector resources, while the Swiss rail network is pulled away under the feet with budget cuts.- Calculations of the HSG St. Gallen show that wages in aviation are 25 percent higher than in other industries;So extremely poorly used money when it comes to creating jobs.
- In addition, in our country, the construction of rail vehicles, including services, traditionally forms a considerable industry, while we practically buy all aircraft, including flight petrol abroad.Concepts instead of quick -shot of the overall traffic concept (GVK) at the time, the federal policy - especially in the case of current financial shortage - does not entitle you to interlink without indiscriminately and fragments.There is also no conception behind this Aviation Act, there is no answer to many urgent questions:
Relationship of regional flying - rail traffic, definition of the tolerable level of motorsport flying, division of labor among the so -called state airports etc. It is not surprising in this unsuitable procedure that neither a decent questioning nor a sufficient inclusion of the Swiss Aviation Commission has taken place.And this in the country with the highest airfield density!
Reliable boundary conditions for the economy of the democratic state must also show the economy clear, long -term perspectives in traffic policy so that it can reliably and innovatively orient their actions to secure their continued existence.From the perspective of the VCS, these scope of action to be defined are primarily the truth of the cost as an economic policy postulate.The fundamental right of all people - including the coming generations - on their own but responsible mobility, forms the socio -political postulate.
- Finally, the third and ecological postulate forms the relocation of significant traffic shares from the road and from the air onto the rail and partly on the water.The economics point out to us that such significant changes take some time, which is why they can be quickly tackled in realizable steps.The individual change phases must be reliably calculable over the entire process, especially for the economy.
Rather, the new, fragmentary and conceptless Aviation Act creates uncertainty and does not fit in any overall vision of Swiss traffic.- We can no longer afford failure in transport, environmental, environmental and economic policy.*

Better annual utilization of the Swissair / / gt.Swissair announces in its house newspaper that in the 1993 financial year it was able to increase its overall relief compared to 1992 by 3.3 percentage points to around 65 %.
Above all, the increase of 16 % in freight traffic should be emphasized;An increase of 7 % was also to be registered with the number of passengers.Politically related setbacks had to be accepted, especially in the connections with Turkey, Egypt and North Africa.
In contrast, the supply of the offer came to Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Far East.Despite hard competition, the North Atlantic passages also rose by 7 %.In this context, however, the Swissair emphasizes that the increase in yield as a result of the strong erosion of the average yield has remained far behind traffic development, and similar requirements must also be expected in the new year.

Financial exposure of air traffic / / rt.Brussels, February 1st of the background of the global earnings in air traffic and the precarious financial problems of most airlines in Europe, a group of experts presented a comprehensive location analysis.
Immediately after a corresponding initiative of the Clinton administration - the group was commissioned by the EC Commission to develop a report that should illuminate the specific European problems.The overall balanced work neither closes the eyes of detailed problems, nor is it passing on political difficulties on the deregulation path that the European Union (EU) has taken.However, the conclusion is clear:
The concept of national airlines, which are more or less dependent on aid, depending on the economy, does not match the global aircraft or the European internal market.Inefficiency on the ground is not the case that Europe's airlines are alone with their earnings problems;The accumulation of the losses - from 1990 to 1992 the IATA companies lost a total of $ 11.5 billion - is rather a worldwide phenomenon that is related to the trend towards cheaper flying and the lack of load (seat load factor).
But, apart from British Airways, the Europeans show company indicators that indicate an efficiency that is worth improving.The focus is primarily on indirect operating expenses such as airport fees or passenger handling costs, which are shown twice as high in SAS or Air Lingus (per ton of kilometers) as in American carriers.Economic thinking in the foreground, the twelve, under the direction of the former Belgian Minister of Transport Hermann de Croo 100 years after the first grasshoppers, deny romanticism and instead put economic considerations in the foreground, they demand that the national governments are resolving non -commercial concerns and theReleased companies in entrepreneurial freedom.
The third EC liberalization package, which is undermined by the economic difficulties, means the way.The suggestions in the political area include the call for a uniform Air traffic outside relationship, i.e. the revision of all bilateral external agreements of the individual Member States in order to combine the European network more efficiently with other continents.Here, for example, you would shake the property of the KLM or Lufthansa on the American market.
Uniform air traffic control to the concrete suggestions is the creation of a uniform air traffic control system that currently replaces 52 subsystems, some of which are not even compatible.This could achieve different goals: Since an average of around 70 aircraft had to shoot queue due to a lack of coordination, environmental protection concerns could take into account and could be combated by bottlenecks and delays.
The combating of new starting and landingways from environmental protection considerations can have counterproductive effects due to the provoked useless flight movements.The report also mentions airport fees as a cost -inflating competitive disadvantage that helps to explain the productivity gradient to the USA.On the subject of taxes, there is a demand for a zero rate for VAT for internal market air traffic.
As far as the handling of passengers and luggage is concerned, the report demands a deregulation that allows several providers.Key figures for productivity 1992ATK1 Doc2 IOC3PRO employees (in Cents Pro ATK)

Military pilot / / Before the Division Court 7 in St. Gallen, the prosecutor scoured the carelessness of the Tiger pilot: "It was a daredevil and ruthlessness." Together with a colleague, Zurich's captain was commissioned to get an "enemy" from Lake Constance (also oneSwiss tiger aircraft).
Shortly after 2 p.m., above the Toggenburg, he noticed a private plane in his airspace on the radar screen.From its order, the Tiger pilot decided to approach the Cessna in order to read its number.At 900 km / h he raced past the machine.
The Tiger engine beam captured the Cessna, which tilted sideways.The Cessna pilot in court yesterday: «The machine flew by 20 to 30 meters next to us.Our two passengers flew from the seats.
A woman suffered abrasions.The other hit the ceiling with his head.Since then she has suffered from a bad whipped trauma. »In

Since 1975 I have completed 2000 flight hours as a military pilot.At Swissair I flew 6000 hours in ten years. »While the auditor applied for 45 days in prison for negligent bodily harm and willful disruption of public transport, the defense lawyer advocated acquittal.The judgment: 7 days in prison, due to two years.

Structural problems of the Olympic Airways / / PS.Athens, 3rd Februardie Head of the State Greek airline Olympic Airways (OA), Minister of Economics and Finance Gennimatas has submitted a report on the company's situation.
In it, a number of measures to renovate society are proposed, which in July 1993 a deficit of 398 billion Dr.(about 2.6 billion Fr.).It is feared that the deficit in the current year 521 billion Dr.will be if no adequate renovation measures are taken.The management of the company supports a restructuring of the fleet and the flight plans as well as freezing wages for five years.
It also advocates creating a permanent competitive structure.In connection with the catastrophic financial situation of the OA, there has been talk of the possibility of covering the deficit by the state for a long time.This, however, is concerned with concerns on the part of the European Union, which makes state support dependent on the life capacity of the company.
Due to the change of government in October 1993, an application for Athens about the repayment of the OA's debt has not yet been treated by the Brussels Commission.Commissioner Abel Matutes is expected to discuss this question on the sidelines of the next conference of the informal council of the European Union with transport minister Charalambou.Local business journalists do not rule out that Brussels will grant the OA a “last chance”, provided that corporate policy is designed according to the EU criteria (livelihood, securing free competition).
While Brussels, as the recently submitted report of the "Commission of the Wise" (cf. NZZ No. 27), shows the privatization of air traffic, one does not speak of such development in local government circles.The proposal regarding the freezing of wages is rejected by the pilots.The associations of the other employees show a certain willingness to concession.
With regard to the possibility of repaying the debts, union officials claim that the state has debt against the OA.A settlement would radically reduce the deficit.With regard to the reasons for the company's financial misery, there is agreement that the OA has served the rulers as a “refuge” for the employment of party policy clientele for many years.

Increased transport performance of the Swissair / / gt.The Swissair announced in a communiqué that it transported 7.825 million passengers last year;
The growth rate, which was only 1.9 % in 1992, rose to 4.7 % in 1993.The entire loaded transport performance was increased by 10.3 (i.V. 9.1) % to 2961 million TKM, namely 6.2 % in passenger traffic and by 16.1 % in freight and post.The average overall load of the aircraft increased by 3.2 percentage points to 64.9 %, while the seat utilization increased by 1.2 percentage points to 61.5 %.
In 1993, Swissair was able to increase its traffic services in all traffic areas compared to the previous year, whereby intercontinental transport increased more than the European routes.The largest increase was achieved in the Africa (+15.6 %) traffic sector;This was followed by the Far East (+12.2 %) and the North Atlantic area (+12.1).
The growth rates were more modest on the South Atlantic routes (+6.9 %) as in Europe (+3.7 %) and in the area of the Middle East (+2.1 %).The striking increase in average occupancy results from the demand (14.8 %) significantly increased compared to the offer (10.3 %).In this context, Swissair again emphasizes (cf. NZZ No. 24) that the income in 1993 was unable to follow in 1993 due to the progressive erosion of the tariffs of the increase in demand.

Air traffic and train complement each other / / The outcome of this coordination is of great importance for the future of Swiss aviation, because Switzerland as an inland is not only dependent on good road and rail connections, but also on smoothly functioning and efficient air traffic connections with abroad.A modern aviation that is uniform throughout Switzerland promotes our economy, makes Switzerland attractive as a location and creates jobs.
Aviation is an important mode of transport for all of us today: air freight for exporting and import important goods, business and holiday trips, working and rescue flights, smallaviatic for the important basic training of our flying youngsters and, not to be forgotten, aviation as a meaningful, demandingand enriching leisure activities.Today's law from 1948 is no longer sufficient.
A timely, sensible and environmentally friendly development of Swiss aviation and a uniform, long -term and jointly Switzerland -Swiss airfield policy can no longer be ensured.The new law creates prerequisites so that traffic development can be better controlled and also environmental policy concerns - such as with the introduction of pollutant -dependent landing fees - are even more taken into account.Approval procedures are finally becoming easier, rapid, more transparent, and more understandable (the say in interested cantons, municipalities and those affected is fully guaranteed).
The approval procedures provided for in the revised aviation law have long been used in railway law.The municipalities and cantons are already familiar with this process.Safety regulations in favor of passengers and third parties on the ground can be adapted faster and more effectively to the rapid technical developments.
With the revision of the Aviation Act, the possibility of a modest financial commitment from the federal government (granting repayable loans) should be created for infrastructure investments that are in the national interest.It should be mentioned that the subsidization of railway and road has been an undisputed naturalness for a long time.There is no competition between regional air traffic and the train.
Rather, these modes of transport complement each other very sensibly.For example, the canton of Ticino owes its economic prosperity to regional air traffic.Heinz Wyss (Birrhard)
1994
Federal coordination of February 20 / / / Although the Swiss Polk can decide on the air traffic policy for the first time in over 70 years, the political discussion about the revised aviation law is loud and is in the shadow of the Alpine initiative.This is no coincidence.
Switzerland's traffic club, seconded by parties and organizations from the red-green warehouse, relies against this legal revision in the referendum on stubborns such as "waste of taxpayers" and "reducing democracy in air traffic".The opposition is essentially only against two of over a hundred laws of law, the increased federal competence in approval procedures and the - possible - low -interest loans of the federal government for extension of the infrastructure.The VCS also hits the sack with its referendum and means the donkey:
With the urn vote on the revised aviation law, he primarily wants to put the wings on the supposed "Hätschelkind" air traffic and "also take on the defaulting federal authorities in terms of environmental protection in the field of air traffic".The declared goal of this long -term prevention policy is to force air traffic up to a distance of 600 kilometers.Even today, the flight on the market on the market can hardly keep up on short and medium -sized routes, provided that the rail services are approaching that of air traffic.
This is proven by examples from France (Lyon-Paris).With the resulting network for high -speed trains in Europe, the railway gets longer skewers and will regain market shares in traffic between the center, without forced measures.This makes ecological and economically useful.
The regional air traffic is therefore not obsolete, certainly not in Switzerland with its decentralized structure.Anyone who has to travel from Lugano to Geneva takes thirty minutes with the plane twelve times longer.The Ticino and the Crossair in particular are a prime example of how strong a marginal region with appropriate location disadvantages is economically dependent on good flight connections.
The opponents of the Aviation Act play regional train and aircraft against each other in their voting struggle and accuse the Federal Council and Parliament, they presented more money to aviation and at the same time withdraw the corresponding funds on the rails.This not only distorts the proportions, but also linked two things that have nothing to do with each other.It is true that the federal government has also supported the construction of the airports with subsidies and low -interest loans in the amount of a total of CHF 734 million by 1990.
However, over 45 billion francs or 98 percent of federal funds in traffic have so far benefited infrastructures from Bahn and Strasse, while air traffic is 1.3 percent.Unlike the train, the Swiss airlines do not receive any annual operating grants.The corresponding legal article only creates a legal basis for the granting of interest -bearing loans in infrastructure buildings for air traffic.
These contributions also require the approval of the parliament.The assertion that air traffic is withdrawn from rail regional traffic can be carried out with a single number comparison: by 1990 the federal government has financially participated in the expansion of airports with a total of CHF 734.5 million.In 1993 alone, however, the federal government did over CHF 1.1 billion in operating fees for regional traffic from rail and bus.
In a single year, the federal government will pay more for regional traffic on the rail when it invested in aviation in 22 years.The only objection remains the strengthening of federal competence associated with legal articles 37 even in the case of approval procedures for infrastructures of air traffic.Aviation is according to the federal constitution
Bundesache.The say in the new, coordinated approval process is now guaranteed in a form that is already known in railway law.The flood of objections on the long way to the “Bahn 2000” also shows that the people, which are well -served by the people, can be delayed or even prevented for years with federal competence.
The streamlined approval procedure ultimately even offers better legal protection for actually affected people: instead of the Federal Council, the Federal Court of the disputes, which is independent of the matter, is now taking on.
On the other hand, what the new law rightly prevents is the systematic prevention of new infrastructures for air traffic on the earlier, multi -level complaint channels.However, the revision is liable for a blemish: the federal airfield concept will only be available after the vote, but therefore no fundamental objections to the revised Aviation Act have been raised by the affected cantons.
Anyone who delays or prevents the adaptation of the infrastructures for air traffic on a principle, not least harms the environment.Airplanes that complete queue in the sky due to overloaded airports and airfill centers in the sky, strain the environment every day without any benefit.On the sidelines of the discussion about the new aviation law it can also be heard that air traffic is wrongly privileged due to the exemption from the fuel duty, since it is the "most environmentally harmful mode of transport".
The discussion, which harms the environment most harms, is like a black and peter game and turns around in a circle.The taxation of air traffic is correct in terms of the truth of the cost and also energy policy, but cannot be enforced by Switzerland alone.Air traffic is already subject to customs taxes in Germany.
Switzerland has also undertook for fuel taxes at the International Civil Aviation Organization.Switzerland alone in cross -border air traffic would be at the expense of the Swissair and the environment.The foreign aircraft would recharge the fuel for the return flight at the start.
The corresponding additional weight would increase fuel consumption and emissions.The applicable aviation law dates from 1948 and is still largely arrested by the spirit of Aviatic pioneering times when environmental protection was not yet a term.The revised law now also requires the review of pollutant emissions in aircraft.
It allows the airport fees to be designed in the sense of steering taxes in which noise production and pollutant emissions are taken into account.Passengers benefit from a ensured liability of the commercial aircraft.With the legal revision, numerous bureaucratic obstacles and detours in flight accident investigations, bilateral air traffic agreements or technical regulations.
The advantages of the Aviation Act - also largely recognized by the opponents - outweigh compared to the few objections.Even with a view to Die Umwelt, it is not advisable to send the revised air traffic law with a rejection to another year -long queue and to cling to the antiquated legal text from 1948.Old aircraft may arouse nostalgic feelings, but with a law of the day before yesterday the aviation of tomorrow cannot be guided to an environmentally friendly course.
International air traffic is subject to European -machine change after deregulation in the USA and liberalization.The Federal Council also needs a contemporary legal basis for its air traffic policy in the interest of Switzerland's business location.With a yes to the revised aviation law, the people should help him to make this necessary leadership.

Contemporary legal basis for aviation / / The referendum against the revised aviation law has so far hardly heated the minds of the traffic club in Switzerland.
A fundamental discussion about Swiss air traffic policy has largely failed to do.To draw the conclusion from this, neither a yes nor to this legally revision is of greater scope, falls short.A small inland like Switzerland is dependent on powerful air traffic and a contemporary legal basis.
The Swiss Aviation Act dates from 1948 and is still largely arrested by the spirit of the Aviatic pioneering times, for which environmental protection was not yet a term.The need to adapt the legal basis is undisputed.The revised aviation law contains a whole series of new provisions that are even recognized by the opponents of the template.
These include, for example, airport fees, the amount of which is also determined by noise emissions and pollutant emissions.In addition, aircraft are now also subject to a review of the pollutant emissions.Passengers can count on a ensured liability for commercial aircraft.
New and revised laws are often accused of - and often rightly - that they are associated with new regulations and more bureaucratic effort.This cannot be asserted by the revised aviation law, because it tightens procedures in the approval of bilateral air traffic agreements and the examination of flight accidents.It also ensures the rapid takeover of technical norms and regulations in European air traffic.
Finally, this is even one of the two stones of the impetus that led to the referendum for approval process for infrastructure systems for air traffic.The second concerns the possibility of interest -bearing loans for systems in the service of air traffic.These indirect expenses of the federal government initially require the approval of the parliament and are very modest compared to other public transport.
The assertion that SBB lost federal funds is absurd.According to the constitution, the federal government is responsible for the concerns of aviation and now wants to claim this competence to approved infrastructure systems.The multi -lane approval process can be coordinated.
Cantons and communities receive a right to hear.The legal protection of those affected is improved by no longer the Federal Council, but that the Federal Court, which is independent of the matter, no longer has the last word.The revised law wants to stop the systematic delay and prevent infrastructures for air traffic.
An efficient infrastructure for air traffic on the ground and in the air not least also serves the environment.Viaper in the sky due to overloaded airports or airfield areas can be avoided.Additional queues of several years must also be avoided in the Appointment Air Act by assuming this suitable legal basis for Swiss air traffic on the urn.
Air traffic is currently subject to profound and rapid change worldwide and especially in Europe.In the interest of Switzerland and the environment, the Federal Council needs a contemporary legal basis for air traffic.The people have in hand to help with a state government's revised aviation law to a gripped management instrument in air traffic policy.

Land consolidation in Austria's regional air trip / / gr.Vienna, February 18th Airlines (AUA) and Tyrolean Airways (TA) announced the interrelation of their regional flight services on Friday.
For this purpose, the AUA acquires 42.85 % of the Tyrolean Airways share, which will be increased by 50 % to 135 million S with this transaction.Austrian will bring in part of the purchase price as a contribution in kind in the form of two DASH 8 machines.So far, 75 % of the Tyrolean company's share capital has been held by Gernot Langes-Swarovski GmbH and 25 % by Leipnik-Lundenburger Industrie AG (Illi), which is part of the sphere of influence of the Raiffeisen money organization.
The new distribution is 42.85 % for Langes-Swarovski and Austrian Airlines as well as 14.3 % for the LLI.Included in the contract are some mutual options through which the President of the Aua Supervisory Board, Streicher, the board directors Bammer and Rehulka (Aua) as well as Feitl (Tyrolean) in detail as well as the financial volume of the transaction (rumors wanted from 290Mio. S know).However, according to Streicher, the operation will never have an impact on the financial structure of the AUA, the balance sheet of which has 40 % share of its own.
In contrast, the integration of mutual regional services is expected to be synergy effects from 80 to 100 million S.The top of the two new partners underlined in front of journalists that the position of the two regional airlines - on the part of the AUA are the Austrian Air Services (AAS) - strengthening in this market segment in Austria and in neighboring countries.In the future, the TA and AAS aircraft is to be operated cooperatively in a completely integrated transport network, which will be operated with 23 aircraft (8 Fokker 50 of the AAS and 15 Dash of the Tyrolean).
The transportation will add to 1.17 million passengers and sales to 2.1 billion S.There is no thought of a type unit of the two fleets, but Tyrolean will convert her fleet from Dash 7 to Dash 8.No necessity is currently being seen for a merger of the two regional airlines;
However, it will not be excluded for the future.The existing collaborations with third parties, in advance that of the Tyrolean with Lufthansa, KLM and Air France, as well as the participation of the Tyrolean in Albania Air are not touched by the two carriers, according to the top managers.Rather, it is exclusively a structural adjustment at the Austrian level, which has already been repeatedly stimulated by foreign partners as "creation of order in their own house".
In this way, the regional flying of the two carriers gains a dimension that will be able to operate in the coming, completely liberalized European market, inexpensive and economical.But you also do not hide the strategic purpose of the operation: the Aua closes an open flank and blocks a possible penetration of foreign interested parties for the future - similar to that of Lufthansa about participation in Lauda Air.

Thrust from all cantons for the Aviation Act / / The revised Aviation Act has received approval in all cantons.At over 61 percent, it has failed more clearly than expected, especially since it is a complicated legal text.
The Swiss Transport Club (VCS) has clearly failed with its referendum and also failed its second goal of triggering a fundamental debate about the "most harmful of all modes of transport".The discussion about the Aviation Act, where it came about, always remained in the shadow of the Alpine initiative.The referendum committee had actually lost western Switzerland and Ticino before the vote, because in their economically difficult situation, these cantons are rather struggling for good connections from their regions to European air traffic.
The verdict was correspondingly clear: The Airport canton Geneva provided the absolute top result with almost 72 % votes, but also Vaud, Valais, Neuchâtel and Ticino recorded high majorities around 68 %. On the agglomerations Zurich, Basel and Bern as wellSensitive small cantons in German -speaking Switzerland set the VCS and the committee “against waste of taxpayers and against reducing democracy”.But the airport cantons of Zurich and Basel also approved the legislative revision in the ratio of 60:40 after the Zurichers had already rejected a cantonal “preventive initiative” to air traffic from the same red-green corner with a two-thirds majority last September.
But even in German -speaking cantons with important regional airfields, the fundamental opposition of the VC did not break into air traffic.Rather, the opponents of aviation had to be noted on this Sunday that the sovereign also knows how to differentiate in ecological concerns: While the alpine initiative predominated the ecological aspects against liberal and European political concerns, the revised aviation law prevailed that ""Kantönligeist »cannot be the adequate design means for a global mode of transport, especially since it also contains a number of provisions in the sense of environmental protection.
From the pleasant result of the vote, however, one should not derive the (incorrect) conclusion that air traffic should now be massively promoted with federal funds because you have a corresponding legal basis.Switzerland's public air traffic should continue to cover its own operating costs.To do this, it primarily needs cheap framework conditions from the public sector.
The revised aviation law with the streamlined approval process points in this direction.The Swissair voting Sunday does not give the reason for great flights of height despite the ancient law, because at the same time the alpine initiative makes the prospects of Switzerland on the air traffic agreement with the EU, which has been sought for years, at least not better.SX.

Before a cultural revolution at Air France?/ / With Supersonian pace and the help of state and staff, the new head of Air France, Christian Blanc, wants to save the French airline from ruin.The signs at the traditional airline have not only been on storm since the strikes last October.
Air France expects a loss of 7.5 billion francs for 1993, and debt is 36 billion francs.However, Air France still wants to do justice to her reputation in all financial worries: At the beginning there is the renewal of the Concorde cabin by the interior designer and designer Andrée Putman.
Concorde as an instrument of the promotionalx.For the fourth time since the first flight 18 years ago, the interior of the concorde is refreshed.Air France commissioned the well -known interior designer and designer Andrée Putman with the youngest rejuvenation cure.
The design scope in the narrow tube of the concord flying at 2200 km / hour is limited.The natural materials in the colors white, pink beige and gray convey a feeling of cheerful calm and pure elegance to the traveler.A refined lighting increases this impression.
The experienced designer convincingly resisted the temptation to accompany the still exclusive travel experience with Mach 2 by Zierat and Chichi inside.Five of Air France's seven concordes were subjected to facelifting, with costs of around six million francs.The Concorde has promoted over 100 million passengers at Air France since the company admission.
It should remain in the service of Air France until the end of the next decade.Two thirds of the Concorde passengers are business travelers.The journey with the concorde is still mostly male, because only 20 percent of passengers are women.
The Concorde has only flew profitably in 1989/90. In the past year, the Concorde on its only line connection Paris-New York with around 40,000 passengers made up for the break-in 1991/92 thanks to promotional tariffs, without its best years with over 46,000To achieve passengers.In 1994 there are also offers that are around 16 percent below the normal tariff with 30,000 francs.
Jean Claude Baumgarten, Deputy General Director Sale at Air France, already sees the ideal means of doctorate in Concorde, since - with the exception of British Airways - no other airline has this solitaire among civil jets.First signs of a recovery of the presentation of the new interior of the Concorde in New York called a 70 percent utilization of the aircraft and a better Yield Management as the main goal of Air France for 1994. Last year, the airline had to work with a capacity for passenger trafficmodest of 67.8 percent.
In 1994 Air France would like to increase the number of passengers by 6 percent and the income in passenger traffic by 4.6 percent after the latter decreased by almost 6 percent in the past year.The numbers of the past two months were encouraging, said Baumgarten and referred to the first few weeks in the new year, in which demand rose by almost 14 percent and the occupancy rate to 73 percent.Air France is likely to be more difficult to stop the earnings erosion, since air traffic is still characterized by overcapacity.
In 1993, the earnings per passenger at Air France passed an average of 7.1 percent.With a better Yield Management, Air France would like to limit the decline to 4 percent in 1994.From spring, the airline wants to tax its traffic inherited.
Air France has to reduce an appeal to the staffing of their productivity compared to the competition to the competition.According to “Aviation Week”, Air France loses over $ 100 with every passenger on the North Atlantic.With the personnel costs alone, the French state carrier wants to save ten percent annually.
Christian Blanc, the successor to the hapless Bernard Attali, told union representatives that the staff had to adapt to a cultural revolution.Air France is in an emergency and need Supersonian thrust to get out of the crisis.In a letter to the staff, Blanc appealed to support the rescue plan for the company in a letter to the company.
Among other things, this provides for a participation of the staff in the Air France share capital in the event of a voluntary waiver of wages.Blanc wants to reduce the high debts, which correspond to the sum of around 70 new long-distance jets of type A-340 with recapitalization by the French state.In addition to debts, Air France also has to reduce the centralistic and time -consuming structures.
Here the gap to competitors British Airways is noticeable: It was only 17 years after Bea and Boac rose in British Airways, Air France, Air Inter and Uta were summarized into a group.The new concept for the Air France Group now provides for independent units with strongly decentralized business areas and a reduced management level.

Spain's State Airline Iberia in upraction / / Iberia, one of the medium-sized European airlines, specializes in the traffic between Europe and Latin America.The Spanish State Holding Ini, as the owner of Iberia, released its previous top manager at short notice a few months ago;
The new men in the company's cockpit are now trying to get out of the loss zone, some of which have been surprising from the loss zone, into which Iberia has maneuvered deeply over the past few years.Together with Alitalia, KLM, SAS and Swissair, Iberia is one of the medium -sized airlines in Europe.After the Second World War, the company, founded in 1927, was the first European airline in Europe with Latin America.
In 1946 Iberia took flights with the DC-4 to Buenos Aires.Since then, Madrid has been the “European Airbrücke Kopf” for the many Latin Americans, the entrance gate to the Old World.The importance of the Spain of the historical-cultural togetherness of “Ibero-America” can also be seen from the fact that even the legal authoritarian Franco regime crossed the air connection with Cuba even at those times, to which the entire westernWorld - you can see from Mexico - the left -wing dictatorship Fidel Castros boycotted.
Expensive engagement in South Americady South Atlantic compounds are still the specialty of Iberia, whose route network, on the other hand, is largely neglected by Africa and Asia.The airline flies into practically all Spanish -speaking countries.Convinced to survive the competition intensified in liberalized European air traffic thanks to the market niche Latin America, Iberia has participated in several South American airlines since 1990.
In the meantime, the company has invested more than one billion dollars in these airlines.So far, this commitment has brought more problems than profit.Although the operational losses of around $ sixty million annually, the Viazolan Viasa has been reduced to around $ twenty million annually, but the traffic volume between Caracas and Madrid is only half as much as during the boom in this economically difficult timesA decades and a half ago.
One of Iberia's unresolved problems are Aerolínea's Argentinas who are getting deeper into the red numbers;According to the Spaniards, this airline should now receive the massive financial injection, which is absolutely necessary, after the Argentine government as the main shareholder - after a long refusal and rather reluctantly - was ready to offer hand for this capital increase.With her investments in Aerolíneas Argentinas and Viasa, Iberia has a market share of more than a third of the air traffic between Europe and South America.
In Miami and Santo Domingo, Iberia built two turnstile, of which nine or two aircraft from Iberia operate as feeders.At the moment, of these DC-9 de facto in Miami, only three and in Santo Domingo have not been stationed in Santo Domingo since October last year.At the headquarters in Madrid, you are stated that the aircraft are assigned to the two bases organizationally.
Deep in the loss zone in the three financial years 1990 - 1992 - with an annual turnover of around five billion dollars - losses of a total of $ 824 million.And when the company had suffered another $ 235 million loss in the first half in 1993 alone, the Spanish State Holding ini stepped in and released top manager Miguel Aguilò.A new management - under the direct leadership of Javier Salas, Ini Chairman, and the managing director Juan Sáez - is now trying to shape society more "aerodynamic" and to increase its productivity.
The massive reduction in the staff inventory, which has already been promoted last year, already comprises a total of 5,000 positions;Iberia now has 24,000 employees.How much the company strategy is in the river is also evident on other levels.
So far, Iberia has so far been particularly proud to have practically all her planes owned.Now this business policy has changed in principle: From now on, no aircraft will no longer be bought, but are rented without exception or "leased", which will bring cost savings of five percent over the next few years.
Colorful Flottedie thing, however, has a small catch: the fleet renewal decision carried out in 1990 - at that time as a “business of the century” in the headlines of the Spanish press - led to the order of sixteen Boeing B -757 after three years of competitive competition between all large number of transport aircraft.as well as eight Airbus 321 and 340;The A -321 order has already been canceled, and the other two contracts are now being "reoriented" - as it is called Euphemistically in the company jargon - which Iberia will undoubtedly be expensive.
Currently, around 120 aircraft from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industry are flying under the Iberia flag: seven B-747, almost thirty B-727, two dozen MD-87, eighteen DC-9 and eight DC-10 or a-300, over twenty A-320 and three leased B-757.If you add the aircraft of the Spanish subsidiaries of Iberia (Aviaco, Viva as well as the regional company Binter Canarias and its younger sister Binter Mediterráneo), a fleet is the size of two hundred aircraft.Complex corporate structure is by no means easy to decide what you actually want to understand by the term Iberia.
Only the "parent company" itself?Or also the Spanish "daughters" mentioned, of whom Aviaco no longer operates exclusively in the national inner -Spanish area and Viva is no longer a charter company?Or are the Latin American companies of Aerolínea's Argentinas and their daughter Austral (Argentina) as well as Viasa (Venezuela) and Ladeco (Chile) to count, in which Iberia not only maintains strong minority investments between 30 and 45 percent, but their management in the case of Aerolíneas ArgentinasAnd Viasa also fully controlled?
The question is by no means easy to answer because Iberia itself turned the company concept upside down.Last summer, an advertising brochure was published, on the front page of which the names of all the airlines mentioned - including the Latin American - are emblazoned in the same "Iberia lettering", with which one wanted to mark the corporate identity;Today, however, one hardly speaks of the "Iberia Group" on the executive floor, but much rather about the individual "operational units", although in fact hardly changed anything.
Cooperation agreement?The corporate strategy has now also changed radically with other airlines with other airlines.So far, it has been taken into account, while other air traffic companies were looking for alliances in order to be able to survive in the new European environment, Iberia will only exist solely thanks to market niche policy (keyword: Latin America).
In the meantime, Iberia is in conversation with two US carriers (Delta and United), both of whom are interested in the Spaniards' South America know-how and in turn could "open" the United States, where Iberia has landing rights in Eighteen cities,But for the time being only uses in New York, Miami and Los Angeles.And in Europe, Iberia apparently negotiates with both Lufthansa and Alitalia about the possibility of "commercial agreements". A certain cooperation experience is definitely available.Since 1972 Iberia has been owned by Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and Sabena for the group of Atlas, founded three years earlier, which has been working successfully in aircraft maintenance for a quarter of a century.
Together with Lufthansa and Air France, Iberia is also the owner of the AMADEUS reservation system, which 24 airlines are connected as a partner and use a total of 88 airlines worldwide for over fifty thousand computer terminals.And finally, the Catering company Iberwiss has existed as a joint venture since 1986 with Swissair, which supplies a total of 27 air traffic companies at various Spanish airports.Daniel Bollag (Madrid)

Bann for old jets from April 1995 in Switzerland / / SX.With a change in the regulation, the Federal Council has tightened the noise regulations for jets.
From April 1, 1995, aircraft with jet engines that are older than 25 at the time will no longer be approved at Switzerland airfields.Airplanes of western and Russian design are affected by this measure, such as the Boeing 727 - 200, 737 - 200, 747 - 100, the DC -8 - 60 and the DC -9 - 30/-40/-50 as well as the Tupolew134 and 154. The basis for this renewed tightening of the noise regulations forms Annex 15 of the Agreement on the International Civil Aviation of Chicago.In a first step, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had set a limits to the non-certified first generation jets of the first generation (so-called Chapter 1 aircraft) until 1988.
Up to this point, these planes had to be pulled out of circulation or provided with quieter engines or silencers.In a second step, it is now the turn of 2 falling aircraft with jet engines.The European Civil Aviation Organization (ECAC) and the EU are pre -spoiled compared to the ICAO.
Since November 1991, aircraft that falls under Chapter 2 must no longer be included in the aviation register.From April 1, 1995, these aircraft, if they were built before 1970, will be banished by the airfields.From 2002 the spell will apply to all aircraft of the Chapter 2nd Switzerland
Furthermore, Switzerland issues its intensified noise regulations in time in time with Europe, but goes one step further by submitting the smaller business jets to these provisions.Only eight aircraft that are affected by the new regulation are entered in the Swiss aviation register.On the other hand, numerous jets of foreign societies that start and land on Swiss airfields fall under the new provisions.
In 1992, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation registered around 40,000 movements of aircraft of this noise category.In the report of the Federal Council, it is said that if important reasons are available, exceptional permits should be issued.In the international bodies of aviation (ICAO, IATA), the developing countries of Africa and South America with their airlines defend themselves against too rapid implementation of these regulations because they lack the money to renew the fleet until 1995.

Swissair harmonizes the European fleet / / Swissair in European traffic on smaller aircraft with higher loads.In autumn 1990 it ordered 26 aircraft (19 A-321 and 7 A-320) to replace the 24 MD-81 from Airbus Industry.
Now she has increased her order by three aircraft and modified the mix in favor of the two smaller models A-320 and A-319: In addition to eight A-321 and 16 A-320, five A-319 will come to the European fleet.In a triangle business with Airbus and Ilfc, Swissair was able to sell its five A -310 - 221 at the same time.
SX.In the short-haul area, Swissair will have the entire new Airbus family 321/320/319 as the first air traffic society.The use of the 29, technically practical aircraft in three different sizes can be adapted to the demand dependent on destination and time of day.
The basic model, the A-320, offers 140 passengers space, the extended A-321 can accommodate 176 passengers, and the shortened version of the A-319 has 109 places.You replace the MD-81 with 126 seats and the A-310-221 with 212 seats.Step to the uniform European flottedank of identical cockpit can be flown by the same pilots in the so-called Common Type Rating.
The manufacturer assumes 10 - 15 % higher productivity in the cockpit.Thanks to the quasi identity of this fleet, the training of the pilots and maintenance costs are also significantly reduced.The fuel consumption of an A-321 is around a third lower than with the A-310-221.
Overall, Directorate President Otto Loepf in the replacement of MD-81 and A-310-221 by the new Airbus family calculates by improving the result by CHF 50 to 60 million per year.The replacement of the MD-81 and A-310-200 by the new Airbus aircraft is therefore accelerated.From January 1995, Swissair received a new aircraft every month by mid -1997.
What happens to the ten Fokker 100, which have been in the service of Swissair since 1988?The aircraft should not be sold at least until 1997.According to Peter Gysel, the head of fleet development, the F-100 has its place below the three Airbus aircraft because it can absorb around 30 % fewer passengers than the smallest Airbus.
According to Otto Loepfe, a handover of the Fokker 100 to the crossair is currently not intended.With exchange business for the first A-319IM April 1996, Swissair will be able to take over the first A-319 worldwide.The decision on the construction of the youngest and smallest offspring of the Airbus family was only made in June 1993.
The Swissair, interested in the A-319 from the start, lights its five aircraft of this type from the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) in Los Angeles because this company takes over the five A-310-221 in return from Swissair.A few years ago, Swissair had unsuccessfully tried to sell these planes with its "exotic" engines.Lufthansa, too, is currently only getting rid of this type of aircraft through a costly conversion to the freighter to Federal Express.
Everyone benefits from the triangle business between Swissair, Airbus Industry and the Ilfc.The Swissair can implement the A-310-221 book profits to finance the new fleet, while Ilfc and Airbus industry have gained a customer with a sounding name for the A-319.Smaller planes better utilize
Swissair only wants to modestly expand its seating capacities until 1997 in the still deficit and only 50 % occupied European traffic.The strategy study, from which the Swissair could be guided in the fleet decision, strives for a 10 % higher load on the short -haul fleet to around 60 %, while at the same time reducing operational costs.The 29 new Airbus aircraft cost 2.35 billion Fri.
The Swissair can cover part of these costs with book winnings from sales of the five A-310-221 and 25 md-81.Ten aircraft have been sold from the latter so far.Since the Swissair has increasingly had to use book profits from aircraft sales to compensate for their operational losses in recent years, additional financing instruments are required.

For the hundredth birthday of Walter Mittelholzer / / on April 2, 1994, the hundredth birthday of Walter Mittelholzer, who as a photographer as well as a pilot and director of the AD Astra and the Swissair, has significantly shaped the structure of the Swiss traffic air trip;With his reports, lectures and books, he also contributed a lot to popularize flying.
In the Walter Mittelholzer, born on April 2, 1894 in St. Gallen as the son of a master baker, photographing and climbing to passion.Despite other talents - he actually wanted to become a chemist - he started an apprenticeship as a photographer in 1911, entered the recruit school three years later, switched to the newly created aircraft in 1915 and contacted the pilot school in 1917;Under Alfred Comte, his later company, he first acquired the civil brevet and the military brevet in early 1918.
When the First World War ended, military pilots were looking for new employment.Small flight operations were created there and there, which were usually only short -lived.Walter Mittelholzer also founded the “Swiss Aero Society Comte, Mittelholzer & Co” together with his former flight instructor, the first commercial aircraft in our country;
This used her two aircraft, which was housed in a hangar in Schwamendingen in Schwamendingen, primarily for passenger flights and air photography.As early as the following year, the company was acquired by the more capitalized “Ad Astra Aero” in Zurich;Mittelholzer, initially chief pilot and Hernach director, headed the company until 1931, the time of merger with the "Balair" to today's Swissair.
Mittelholzer became the technical director of our national airline, during the one year younger Balz Zimmermann, until then head of the Balair, took over the commercial leadership.This two -team, although the species of fundamentally different, complemented itself and helped the young Swissair quickly to an international reputation.Pioneer performance agent Holzer's aerial photographs also made him known abroad.
In the summer of 1923, he was able to take part in a Spitzbergen flight organized by the German Junkers aircraft works.A year later he was back with a Junkers machine;This time he had to clarify the possibilities of a flight connection between Europe and Tehran on behalf of the Persian government.
The great Africa fell received worldwide, in which Walter Mittelholzer was the first to cross the black continent with an airplane from December 7, 1926 to February 21, 1927.The “Switzerland”, which was equipped with swimmers, a Dornier-Merkur, belonging to the ad Astra, covered 14,500 kilometers in numerous stages and interrupted by several incidents.For the following years, Walter Mittelholzer led to Africa twice: in the winter of 1929/30 with a Jagdex pedition by Baron Rothschild;
In doing so, he was the first to climb the two highest mountains of the continent, the Kilimanjaro (6000 m) and the Mount Kenya (5355 m).In 1931 there was a flight to the Niger and to the Chadsee;The proven three-engine movement aircraft Fokker F-VII 3 m was used in both companies.
The Swissairim May 1932, as the first European Society, began record flights and first performance of the Swissairim May 1932, the Lockheed “Orion” type traffic aircraft;Mittelholzer made numerous demonstration flights with them that received great attention and contributed to the international reputation of the Swissair;Particularly noteworthy is a day flight from Zurich to Tunis and back, lying the 2600 kilometers in the then surprisingly short time of only 812 hours.
As an expression of trust and appreciation that Mittelholzer had equal to famous pilots, designers and crowned heads, the handover of a three-engine Fokker aircraft can be considered to the Abyssinian emperor.In February 1934 he flogged the machine bought by Haile Selassie from Swissair and equipped for his personal use to Addis Ababa.In the same year, Swissair, again as the first company in Europe, began to accompany its flights through hostesses.
Mittelholzer as a publicist Walter Mittelholzer was always important to try out new things and gain experience;In 1926, together with a German pilot, he set up several world best for flights with supply loads.In 1930 he used the “Count Zeppelin” airship on an American trip, two years later he sat at the wheel of the then largest aircraft, the Dornier “do-X” flight boat, which was used at the time, such as the airship, as the aircraft for a futureTransatlantic traffic.
With his work, Walter Mittelholzer contributed a lot to understanding the young flying.In his lectures and writings, he always reported on the beauties of the flight, the experience of the Alps from the bird's show as well as the difficulties of flying to unknown areas.His reports and books - he wrote 11 works - as well as the large number of recordings are of permanent documentary value.
On May 9, 1937, he fatally ancient climbing in the Hochschwab area, Styria, Austria.With him and Balz Zimmermann, who succumbed to an illness in the same year, the Swissair lost its two directors, our country at the same time two pioneers, who made the Swiss traffic air trip of the twenties and thirty years.Alfred Waldis (Lucerne)

So far, only American airlines in the departure hall;So now four European societies with a high proportion of the traffic volume of the Zurich Airport on the “Handliking Front” are now appearing separately.Liberalization success in the departure hall is the time because the departing passengers of the line companies in Zurich airport did not only have to search for the correct handling switch, but could "check in" practically at every open switch with a ticket and flight booking in the pocket.
This condition, which seemed so practical for the passengers and was praised by many as an advantage of Zurich Airport compared to most foreign airports, was not durable for various reasons: on the one hand, a monopoly was connected, namely the SWISSAIR handling monopoly, which wasInevitably had to be accepted as a so -called handling agent to the other airlines, and on the other hand, the companies could not offer any special service for their passengers when it comes to processing.Monopolis are out of date, and so the handling monopoly in Zurich Airport (as well as in Geneva Cointrin) had to fall;
If they want, airlines can now take care of their passengers on their own handling switch with their special services - and should they only consist of a particularly cumbersome procedure, such as that you have to do with American companies before flights to the United States.The American airlines were the first to enforce their right to the so-called dedicated check-in at their own switches in Zurich Airport, in return that the Swissair in the USA was granted additional traffic rights.Other societies have now equated in the course of European liberalization of air traffic and are now greeting their departing passengers at special switches in the airports Zurich and Geneva.
Remodeling in the Terminal Bdie Airlines that have chosen their own switches are housed in Terminal B, while the Swissair with its partner companies, including the Singapore Airlines, occupies Terminal A.In order for the passengers to find their switch better in the departure hall in Terminal B, in the future on the scoreboard for the departures will no longer be pointed out to the departure gates, but to the respective series of switches in the check-in area.
In addition to the switches divided according to companies, there are still general switches in Terminal B for the passengers of companies without their own handling.The handling for Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France and KLM on particularly marked switches is still provisionally provided by Swissair on behalf, but their staff is particularly trained by the respective companies.The Jet Aviation, who has been responsible for the handling of the charter flights in Zurich Airport for a long time, is now also approved as a handling agent for regular traffic, but apparently has a difficult time in the competition with Swissair.
As flexible as possible, the introduction of the dedicated check-in instead of the common check-in means that the capacity of the switch systems is reduced as a whole.In order to keep this disadvantage low, you look for ways of flexible switch division.
This not only includes a facility for changing the lettering above the switch, but the companies involved must also agree on shared solutions for the equipment of the switches with computer terminals.If the passengers gather separately in front of special handling switches according to airlines, there are also special security problems because they could form an object for targeted attacks against certain states or airlines.Additional security advance - organizational and structural nature - had to be hit than the airlines from the USA have been set up.
For the passenger, references to the further development of the dedicated check-in may have the advantage that when you start your trip, the handling for connecting flights with the same company can be carried out, so that further check-in is no longer necessary when changing.But that depends on the possibilities of the individual airlines.Lufthansa, for example, plans to introduce the "through processing" for its entire network to June 1, 1994 in Zurich.

European think tank for the Concorde successor / / UG.London, 8. Aprinie European aircraft manufacturer British Aerospace (BAE), Aerospatials and the German Aerospace (DASA) will work together on a feasibility study on the production of a civilian supervision passenger aircraft.
The BAE and the aerospatials have been coordinating their activities in the search for a successor for the concorde they developed by them in the 1960s.The European Supersonic Research Programs (GESP), with which the three companies want to avoid, is being involved in a research deficit towards the US competitors;These benefit for the time being exclusively from the technological clarifications estimated at around $ 1.2 billion for the development of an overs sound traffic aircraft.
In the European research program, design studies for a transport aircraft with a range of 10,000 km, a transport capacity of 250 passengers and a travel speed of approximately twice sound speed are to be carried out.In contrast to the concorde, the new generation should be economically successful and the development costs - which are estimated at $ 10 - 15 billion.No double lanes in the development all three companies are members of the International Supersonic Study Group, which meets twice a year and maintains an exchange of ideas about commercially non -sensitive aspects such as environmental issues.
The loosely shaped study group also includes Boeing, McDonnell Douglas as well as Italian, Russian and Japanese aircraft manufacturers.In industry circles, there is largely agreement that the extraordinarily high development and production costs will not allow several competing projects to be implemented at the same time.It is therefore to be expected that the global aircraft industry will agree on a single proposal and a worldwide cooperation in the next few years - if it really wants to produce a new overview aircraft.
In parallel to the study groups, European manufacturers of aircraft engines work on designs for economically and ecologically acceptable engines.The BAE estimates global demand on 500 to 1000 aircraft;In contrast, only 16 units had been produced by the Concorde, which had celebrated its maiden flight around 25 years ago.
The first commercial use is not to be expected before 2005 or even 2010.Open financing fragedia hopes that they will receive public subsidies for their research activities from the national governments and from the Brussels Commission.
The expenses are initially estimated at $ 100 million per year.So far, the operation had been significantly lower.The BAE had spent less than £ 5 for preparatory work.

Curtain for the Boeing 777 / / SX.The roll-out for the largest two-jet jet so far will take place on Saturday at the largest manufacturer of civil aircraft in the American Everett near Seattle.
The Boeing 777 will absorb 300 - 400 passengers in two different versions and transport them over routes of 7000 to 11,000 km.The “Triple Seven” is said to fill the gap between the 747 - 400 and the 767 - 300.It is Boeing's answer to the MD-11 and A-330 /340 of competitors McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industry, which are already in the linie service.
Boeing only decided in October 1990 to build a completely new large space jet.McDonnell Douglas had launched her MD-11 almost four years earlier and had 170 orders up to that point.airbus
Industry had chosen its long-distance twins A-340/330 in mid-1987 and at that time already 217 orders in the order books.If Boeing also wanted to secure the lion's share in the strong growing market for medium -sized large space, the giant had to come up with something in Seattle, since he could not lead the fight with a similar product over the price.Three trumpboards, with three years late into the race, rely on three trump cards in the “Triple Seven”.
With a cross -section of 6.2 meters, the fuselage is more spacious than that of the two competitive models and offers space for an additional 30 passengers.This giant twin with a maximum starting weight of 260 tons needs wings of 60 meters wings and two engines with a thrust of £ 70.Boeing hit new paths in the design of the new aircraft.
For example, the company involved specialists from eight airlines from four continents in design and specification of the new aircraft.235 “Design Build Teams” formed jointly by manufacturers, subsequent suppliers and potential customers designed the new Jet - at least for the proud Boeing works a small cultural revolution.Finally, in Seattle, when designing the "Triple Seven", people finally said goodbye to "Paper Plane" and only trusted computers.
The individual parts developed in the numerous design teams can be combined and coordinated with each other thanks to the French software CATIA (computer-aided, three dimensional interactive application).This saves costs on the drawing board and should have a positive effect on the precision of production and reduce the infamous “teething troubles” of the new jet.The first flight of the Boeing 777 - 200 is planned for the first flight in June.
After that, an intensive certification program begins, because in May 1995 the first jet is to be handed over to the Launching Customer United Airlines.So far, 16 airlines have firmly ordered a total of 147 “Triple Seven” and deposited 108 options.The further success of the Boeing 777, the development of which cost around $ 4 billion, also depends on how quickly this two -jet aircraft with a range of over 7000 kilometers can be used from the start over longer distances without landing option (water, deserts).
Until recently, the aviation authorities granted the corresponding ETOPS certificate (Extended Range Twin Operations) only after several years of probation in the line service (e.g. A-310 and B-767).Aer Lingus's A-330 in the coming summer.The A-330 was first approved by the American and the European aviation authorities last October.United, the first customer of the 777, wants to use this aircraft in traffic with Hawaii.

Way clear to the renovation of the Air France / / HDG.Paris, April 11th Personnel of the French Air of France has spoken out with a massive majority in favor of the renovation plan elaborated by Air France President Christian Blanc for the highly indebted state.
A rejection of the program would have exacerbated the already deep crisis in Air France and might have to mean its crash.Agreement of a state capital injection medal of around 40,000 employees
The Air France clears the way for the implementation of a framework plan, with the help of which the airline is supposed to get wind under the wings.He provides for the dismantling of around 5000 jobs without layoffs until the end of 1996, freezing wages and salaries for three years, a stopping of transport this year, savings in material purchases of 2 billion ffr.This year and the extra service of 17 aircraft until 1999.
The task of airlines is not planned.The state's main shareholder has promised that with a positive answer from the staff to the rescue plan by the end of 1996 around 20 billion ffr.to provide .
However, this capital injection requires approval by the European Brussels European Commission. “Last chance” for the Air France was the last financial year of a rapid dive, which at the company has a loss of 7.5 billion FFR.as well as a debt of 37 billion ffr.left.
The degree of utilization of the machines has dropped to less than 70 %.In October last year, the then Air France President, Bernard Attali, presented a first rescue plan, but had to withdraw it after violent protests, sometimes violent demonstrations and strikes of the staff.He himself was forced to resign by Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and replaced by Christian Blanc.
Blanc's plan does not differ significantly from that of his predecessor.But he understood to present him as a "last chance" for the Air France.He also did not shy away from the threat of resigning his office if the employees should vote on the plan.
This perspective became more and more improbable after the three most important union organizations at Air France - the Force Ouvrière, who was politically neutral, the communist -oriented CGT and the socialist CFDT - their supporters had asked for yes or no election recommendation.Minister of Transport Bosson, in turn, had campaigned for the plan."The outstretched hand must not be rejected," he recommended.

More financing scope for Finnair / / NZ.Stockholm, 22nd Aprinie Finnish government, has proposed the parliament of a loosening of the legal provisions in order to pave the way for a stronger participation of private investors in Finnair.
However, there is no talk of a completely privatization of the air traffic society.The state is currently checking 72 % of the Finnair votes;In the course of the placement of changing eligades worth 250 million FMK.
If state participation would drop to less than 68 % if all of the convertible rights were perceived.According to the law amendment submitted to the Reichstag, the state could reduce its participation of up to 50 % plus one vote.The Ministry of Transport announced on Friday that Finnair could issue new titles for the state to strengthen the equity base, for example.
However, the sale of Finnair shares by the state is not intended at the present time.On request, a spokesman for Finnair said that a closer cooperation with another airline, such as by means of an capital -based integration, is not sought.If stocks were emitted, institutional investors would be the favorite target group on the international financial market.

Everything depends on a thin thread / / on Heinz Lippuner, Zurich*Although the lift statistically represents the safest means of transport, fear in the lift can often be found.She can comment in different ways: as a space to get stuck as a fear or even crash.
Anyone who is plagued by such fears knows how to avoid the impending dangers and avoid the elevator.There are said to be several clinics for lift phobics today.When asked about fears in the lift, the participants react with a tired smile.
If you know such fear or even panic reactions, you have perfected your situation phobia so far that you can live without any elevators.And nobody will travel to the USA, where buildings without a staircase are commonplace.The psychiatric classification today speaks of “Panic Disorder with Limited or Extensive Phobic Avoidance”, and in addition to the fears, also avoiding.
Fear of the suffocation of F. does not describe without pleasure, which life he leads in detours - he has to travel a lot - to avoid the two worst situations that threaten him in life: not being able to get out in tram, bus or train at any time andThen faint or lose control.He never speaks of elevators, and as one in a dream, Mr. F. is - the lift as the epitome of fear.Four -year -old P. is an enthusiastic lift driver.
After a small operation on a not unimportant organ, he decides to cope with the four floors for the doctor's office on foot in the future, which he describes as much funny;He no longer mentions the lift.These are not isolated cases, otherwise it would not be apparent at the end of March in a German private broadcaster at the very best broadcast time, a elaborate commercial from the fire brigade, that elevators could never crash first and secondly there is no risk of suffocation in the event of getting stuck.
Coincidentally, the headline of the NZZ was found exactly the next morning: "Mann suffocated in the elevator.According to statistics, the lift is the safest means of transport in general - even climbing stairs hides larger dangers.
Now man learns occasionally from experience, also from statistically recorded, but as far as his fears are concerned, he adheres to their logic, i.e. the success statistics of his avoidance behavior.In 1970 the first clinic for lift phobias was opened in New York, and today there are said to be a number of specialized institutes, but they make it easy in that when they attribute the lift phobia to two simple learning mechanisms with a learning theoretical background.In the meantime, it is known that even the Pawlov dog or the many experimental rats can only train behaviors and subsequently be removed from their behavioral repertoire.
So the question arises, which distinguishes the lift that fears are so attached to it.If we trust the lift industry and its research, fear is a product of disorientation.In the lift, when the eyes are closed, it is no longer more noticeable whether the lift drives vertically or horizontally, the speed estimates are wrong, and this is the unusually strong physical sensations that trigger vertical acceleration and movement.
The time, which was quickly drowned, increases the fearful impression.This should remove even noises and the simulated floor display - surprisingly often horizontally and here and here even with an analogous mini lift.Birth trauma or Babylon syndrome?
However, the phobic seems to be ridiculous in the face of his central fears of being cut off from all escape routes and losing control in public.Not only the feature film made the lift the place of fear of being locked up;The emotion of fear itself is an agonizing, indefinite feeling of setting and being delivered.
Is that being included in the source of fear?Is the birth trauma at the beginning of every fear experience?In view of the period since the lifestyle, it would be forced to speak of a priority of the lift driving - but how when we see the conquest of the height, even the sky?
Are we dealing with the lift with a modification of the Kierkegaard sentence, according to which the “dizziness of freedom” results in fear of existence?With Jeannot Simmen you can describe the lift and its history of development (to quieter and gentler movement) than to build up the displacement process of a society, “to build up, and at the same time get afraid of growing beyond itself: the Babylon syndrome». A small episode should show us a different direction.A friendly psychiatrist tells how he goes open after closing the main door of a client and with her up the very tight staircase.
By Schalk, she says: «So, the lift is broken again.»Freud describes fear as a state of highly spanned excitement, which is felt as unpleasant and one of which cannot be mastered by unloading.Not only at the fair, people seek the "thrill" of the change in gravity.
The pre-tasting character of passive movement, swearing and growing, is striking.When the lift stands out, the soft knees don't just remind you of fear.The physical processes themselves are afraid or pleasure, never just accompanying phenomena.
In his famous "neurosic apprenticeship", Otto Fenichel says: "The fear of falling from great heights, as well as car and railway phobias show at first glance that they show attempts to combat pleasant sensations associated with an irritation of the sense of balance.This last factor, the fight against sexual excitement, as it is perceived in lustful equilibrium perception, plays a special role in many fear hysteria.“Seen in this way, lift addicts should also be considered.
But where the kinesthetic perception reports hopefully eroticism, the eye in the technical lift cabin is looking for triggering key stimuli since the chic uniformed lift boy no longer exists.In vain?Tried
The experience of experience forces us to take another aspect into account, the presence of passengers, often of too many.Where else is man without chance to miss the tightness, the violation of his personal border.The attempts to draw boundaries begin even before the journey.
While you like to talk for tram or train, nobody does this in front of the lift door, which stays the case during the whole trip, even among acquaintances.As early as 1929, it was said in Vogue's Book of Etiquette: "Since the lift is a very tight place and people have to stand together, it explains very well why the male behavior shows itself there.»
What is meant to lose weight, but the shameful busser view of your own shoe tips gives an idea of the inner movement.Whether the lowered head is amazed and knowing that the essence of neurotic fears is its connection to drive impulses, the implementation of which is experienced as a danger, we cannot avoid regarding the lift ride as a situation in which the freely flotting fear of theapparently freely floating lift.However, where in many anxiety situations other people are sought as a security dispenser, they are not exactly a consolation in the confinement of the lift - they are too close and fight too.
No straw that could be clinging to, there is no hold on the smooth walls.All that remains is the attempt not to grow the claustrophobic mood for a paranoid attitude.So far, the risk of crashes have neglected that many are not the fear of getting stuck in the bones, but is all about the risk of crash.
For the layperson, the elevator hangs on a rope, and this is exposed to the realization.Since there is nothing to be seen, you hear every pulling and cracking (the round of the lift runs, the more excited the ears in deviations), and similar to Erica Jong in her erotic novel "The Fear of Flying" you only trust your own strength: "Whatever about diabolical explanations about the load -bearing capacity of aircraft in multilingual & lt; Information to Passengers & GT;Stand - I personally I am convinced that only my own concentration (and that of my mother, which seems to be expected, that her children will be killed in a plane crash). »And - who does not know the game - to be collected at the last moment.
Again we ended up with the fear of fear.We are not dealing with the lift, but archaic is definitely the process as such inner conflict voltage into an outer anxiety situation.The lift is ideal as a metaphor, where the elevator like the stairs transition, ascent and power or their failure symbol.
But we do not need to get down so deeply into the social unconscious, because every lift ride makes it experienced that we cannot miss the process of changing that the reminders and social impoverishment cannot be escaped, but the biological-emotional "apparatus" onlySlowly follows when it doesn't even get stuck.* The author is a psychoanalyst and employee of the social psychological counseling center “Open House Zurich”.

One year without distribution / / contrary to the trend in global air traffic, Swissair also generated a positive annual result in 1993, which, however, failed so briefly that - after the dividend for 1992 - a distribution is completely avoided.Since there was a tendency to do this between the first and the second semester of 1993, which seems to be ongoing in the first quarter, the Swissair management with the running cost-saving measures sees a reason to expect a result improvement in 1994.
Gt.Although the Swissair Group (cf. Kasten) was able to achieve a CASH Flow, CASH Flow CHF 518 million in 1993, the proven annual profit reached only around half of the previous year's result.However, this result, as unsatisfactory it is, deserves - as Chairman of the Board of Directors Dr.Hannes Goetz presented the balance sheet press conference - all the more attention than in the first half of 1993 a loss of CHF 65 million had to be accepted;
In the second semester alone, it was practically deserved as much as in the whole of 1992. At the same time, the annual profit of the Swissair Airfare company in 1993 decreased to CHF 6.7 (I. 20.8).Goetz sees the main reasons for this unsatisfactory result in the international price decay and in currency -related revenue inlays to a considerable amount of CHF 19 million;
The greatly reduced profit forces Swissair to apply for a waiver of the dividend to the General Assembly on May 19.No results of the result for the year 1993 are created, structured and consolidated for the first time according to new Swiss share law and EU rules.In this context, Goetz emphasized that the aircraft depreciation policy measured on a careful useful life (twelve years) was continued;
No reserves were dissolved.The net profit generated by the Swissair in 1993 was real and is based on the successful services coupled with the primary product and on the realized book profits from aircraft sales;According to the new share law and the EU directive, these are considered to be ordinary operating income and are therefore not extraordinary income for the result of the result.
In the sense of a forward strategy, Goetz then described five objectives as a consequence of the failed “project Alcázar” for the Swissair: the consistent further deepening and use of the existing collaborations, especially with Austrian Airlines (AUA) and SAS on the one hand, Delta and Singapore Airlines;the establishment of a slim and efficient group structure as well as a result -oriented leadership;And finally the closer interweaving of Swissair, Crossair and Balair / CTA.
These four components should serve the fifth objective, namely the improvement in results by continuing the cost and earnings management perceived by all.Before the press, the President of the Executive Management, Otto Loepfe, initially stated greatly increased productivity -like.has reduced.At the same time, productivity per employee has increased by 9 % in the reporting year, while the yield was increased by 6 % per person unit of personnel costs;
The fact that this productivity has been increased by no less than 37 % has been increased from the fact that this productivity has been increased since 1990.The results of the results, which result from the Move Rationalization Plan in 1990, quantified Loepfe to CHF 300 million for 1993 and to CHF 400 million for the current year.With the harmonization of the European fleet (cf. NZZ No. 52), cost savings from CHF 50 million to CHF 60 million should also result.
A noticeable increase in efficiency will also be expected from the tightening of the group structure from 1995, which, however, cannot be quantified for the time being.Then Loepfe recalled that the “Alcázar project” was intended, among other things, in response to deregulation in European air traffic as in 1993.Remarkably, this deregulation did not take place in the expected extent or in the expected speed because too many countries protect their national societies from a really free competition.
With regard to cooperation, for example, no powerful European constellation has yet developed, which could be said that it has proven itself in the market.From this point of view, according to Loepfe, the results from the cooperation with Austrian Airlines and SAS as well as Delta and Singapore Airlines have been considerable.
When answering a question, the president of the management emphasized that the Swissair is currently not conducting a cooperation talks with Lufthansa.Administrative Council President Goetz then pointed out that around 11 % of Swissair shares are currently “in disposition”, i.H.are not entered in the stock register;However, this relatively high quota is related to the fact that the holder titles have recently been converted into name shares.
At the same time, he stated that a stock package held in England could not be associated with British Airways.The Swissair Group has developed improved outstanding prospects for 1994 in the current year than in the same period in 1993. In the airline, traffic has increased by 13 % in the first quarter, and the occupancy rate increased by 3 percentage points.
It is important to be the fact that traffic development has improved particularly in Europe, as the corresponding share of the route yields (see box on flight operating indicators) is of crucial importance for Swissair.This is precisely why - in addition to all measures that can be taken internally to reduce costs and increasing the income - according to Loepfes, she also needs every conceivable support at the political level, so that it is not pushed away from the European competitors.Important prerequisites to prevent this are, for example, better market access, tariff freedom and the abolition of capacity restrictions.
Since the integration of their home country in Europe for the Swissair should ultimately become a question of survival, their management hopes that the political instances will do everything to bring Switzerland out of political isolation quickly.Key figures of the SwissAir group (monetary values in MIO CHF) 199119921993 successes: flight operating income4 2564 3024 Anders Operating income1 6881 9122 Operating income yields 2146 403 material expenditure2 670 personnel efforts495526514.Operating expenses689709687 Occupational efforts161214216FINANZ BENT -65 - 94 - 119 -year profit (net) 8311359 Balance: Real estate1 5401 514 aircraft park3 180 system 3 505 own capital2 8382 907 freight capital5 2975 4075 583 Personal inventory25 33825 80025 026 flight operating index

Lufthansa drove out the cage / / the German government has in principle cleared the greatest obstacle to the extensive privatization of German Lufthansa: With around DM 1.5 billion, Lufthansa wants to free the traditional pension.
While the federal government intends to ward off its shares "in line with the market", Lufthansa is planning a capital increase.Gy.Bonn, 4th Maidie German government seems to have torn down the last crucial hurdle that had previously been in the way of privatizing Lufthansa.
As Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Minister of Transport Matthias Wissmann and the group management of Lufthansa jointly explained to the media, a solution for the long-term controversial problem of retirement provision of Lufthansa has been found a solution that should actually agree with the parties involved.With the package solution that has now been presented, the federal government in principle is buying the Lufthansa from a number of obligations so that privatization is accelerated and "the crane can fly more freely than ever before and into the black".Fult -grown because Lufthansa is involved in the regulation of the additional pensions in the federal and state care institution (VBL).According to the statutes of this institution, the VBL can terminate Lufthansa as soon as the federal government's share in the aviation company falls below 50 %.
In order to prevent this, the federal government - which today controls 51.4 % of the capital - would have to be proportional to the other investors in every capital increase in the transport company and the corresponding means.Lufthansa and the government drove this more and more clearly into a dilemma: on the one hand, the federal government did not want to put any additional funds in the aviation company, on the other hand, a capital increase in Lufthansa had become increasingly urgent.
After the company had shown an equity ratio of 35.8 % in 1989, the own funds melted in the following years, so that the proportion was only 17.8 % at the end of 1992.With the proposed regulation, the VBL receives the statutory payment of around DM 1 billion due to the departure of Lufthansa by the federal government in 15 -year installments of 80 million.This is intended to guarantee VBL services to today's pensioners, around 6000 people.
As far as the over 45,000 employees are still active, Lufthansa should include their pension claims as appropriate provisions.The pension provisions are estimated at a total of DM 1.6 billion, for which special items (DM 1.1 billion) are dissolved and a interest on the federal government (DM 0.5 billion) should also extend the balance to sufficient level.The federal government repays the constructed claim in ten equal annual rates of around DM 74 million.
Lufthansa also becomes a mandatory member of the pension security association (PSV), and finally the federal government assumes a guarantee of DM 1.1 billion for the claims of the active Lufthansa employees, as far as or as long as the PSV should not.Hope for privatization proceeds The burden for Lufthansa - if the VBL has calculated in line with the causes - shouldn't be too difficult, you calculate the federal government with a noticeable effects.According to today's ideas, the budget will be burdened with DM 154 million each for ten years, then for another five years with DM 80 million.
At the same time, Waigel emphasized the interest savings and possible income from privatization, which may have created a favorable mood for the present solution.In addition to the “market -friendly and market -friendly” sale of Lufthansa shares - today the federal package corresponds to about 3.1 billion DM - you want to sell the subscription rights at the capital increase that is still expected for this year, of which one is around 150 million. DM promises.As Wolfgang Röller, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Lufthansa, outlined, would like to apply to the Annual General Meeting in July the creation of an approved capital, in order to then increase the own funds by a little more than DM 1 billion.
New mobility for the entrepreneurial exemption is not only of central importance for the increase in the equity of Lufthansa.The withdrawal of the public sector and thus the thousand -eyed sovereign supervision from Lufthansa should generally inspire the implementation of the renovation concept initiated about two years ago.In addition to a cost reduction program and a strategic realignment - for example in the form of the now approved partnership with the American United Airlines - the project also provides for an adjustment of corporate structures.
According to the statements by Jürgen Weber, the CEO of Lufthansa, this reform can be promoted quickly with the privatization in order to align society to the global markets.In addition, it was indicated in the margin that the Austrian Airlines, but not with the Swissair, were still under discussions.The proposal presented by the government must still be adopted by the tariff parties, the committees of the VBL and the Supervisory Board and Annual General Meeting of Lufthansa.

Emirates - An airline like from 1001 night / / a little fairytale already sounds: in 1985 Emirates took up flight operations in Dubai with two leases.
One would not have been betting on their success, since this emirate only has a small home market and is within reach of political stoves.In addition, 54 airlines flew to Dubai at the time, and many routes from Europe to Asia can be mastered on the Golf without intermediate landing.Nevertheless, Emirates now flies with 15 jets over 30 destinations and will continue to grow after a short breath.
SX.Dubai, in April two leased aircraft and $ 10 million from the Dubai Dubai Chatulle, Emirates entered the aviation business in October 1985.Three destinations on the Indian subcontinent with high guest workers (Bombay, Delhi, Karachi) were initially used.
Next year, Emirates started to jump to Europe with the destinations Frankfurt and London.From August 1992 Zurich found connection to the line network of Emirates, initially via Rome, non -stop to Dubai from 1993.In the first full financial year (1986), Emirates transported over 300,000 passengers, in the youngest (1993/94) there are already over two million.
The fleet has grown accordingly: five A -300 - 600r and eight A -310 - 330 and two Boeing 727 - 200 are currently in use.An A -310 - 300 will be added next August and an A -300 - 600R in March 1995.Incidentally, the rapidly grown airline treats itself to a short break until the first of a total of seven fixed Boeing 777 will arrive in March 1996.
Both versions of the “Triple Seven” ordered the first three Boeing 777 in the A version in a three-class configuration.The large twin jet is used on the most important destinations to Asia and Europe.Tim Clark, commercial director of Emirates, also catches the eye for the 777 Dubai-Zurich route.
It is not dissatisfied with the progress of this route, even if this destination develops more slowly compared to the English or Indian market.You appreciate the high proportion of fully paying passengers in traffic with Switzerland.However, the combination of Manchester and Zurich with Dubai is not ideal.
In the medium term, you strive for a daily flight after all European destinations.Nevertheless, Zurich is neither able to fill a 777 three times a week alone, nor today there is demand for a daily flight with an A-310. In May 1997, Emirates expects the first Boeing 777b.This aircraft allows flights with a larger range or more freight.
With the takeover of the four 777b, Emirates wants to convert the A versions to two classes.The extremely high charging factors on the routes to the Indian subcontinent (on average well over 80 %, even 99 % in Bombay) call a new aircraft with a significantly larger capacity.Around 500,000 of the 700,000 inhabitants of Dubai come from India, Pakistan and the Philippines.
Consistent “Open-Skies Policy” The rulers of Dubai have been relying on “Open Skies” in aviation policy for more than two decades.When Emirates started operating, Dubai was already in the line network of 54 airlines, many of which even have rights in “fifth freedom”.
The young airline could not rely on petrodollars from the state box.Rather, from the beginning of the stiff wind of the competition, she blew in the face.Scheich Ahmed, a member of the ruling family and President of Emirates, underlined in a presentation on the occasion of the latest Air Show in Dubai, Emirates does not receive any financial help from the government.
But thanks to the government's consistent “Open Skies Policy”, Dubai developed into a hub of air traffic in the Middle East, long before Emirates started operating, says Maurice Flanagan, directorate and man of the first few hours at Emirates.He is also convinced that this open aviation policy Emirates has been successful and rapidly growing in one of the most difficult phases of world air traffic.Singapore Airlines As a model with the exception of the second financial year, Emirates has always made a profit, says the commercial director, Tim Clark.
You have to believe, because the airline does not announce numbers.A look at the names of the donors to finance the young fleet allows the conclusion that this company enjoys high loans from financial institutions in Europe, Asia and in the Middle East.The government's indirect influence on the airline and its creditworthiness is still considerable.
The people responsible for Emirates keep saying that they want to be on the Golf with their airline on what Singapore Airlines has become in Southeast Asia.In fact, there are a number of similarities: the multilateral aviation policy of the government, the young, uniform fleet, an internationally composed workforce (60 % from the Asian area) and the clear marketing strategy.In 1985, management was aware that Emirates could not simply get in with the same but cheaper product on the well -occupied Dubai market.
They searched niches and found them, for example with the tourists in Europe who were tired of rainy summer.Already in the first year of operation, well over 10,000 tourists from Germany flew to the Golf.With Arabian Adventure, Dubai has also built up its own company for tourism on the Golf.
With the individual video sets in all three classes and with screens at every seat, Emirates set a trademark that the young airline quickly received awards and recognition.The passengers of all classes have the choice between several programs, can also choose synchronized films.There is a channel for children.
The installation of these personal video sets per plane cost $ 1.4 million, but this investment has paid off quickly.Even the two old Boeing 727 has meanwhile equipped Emirates with this video system.As high as possible, the high level of independence from Emirates also counts the independence.
You want to do whatever possible on your own.Cooperations are always associated with smaller disadvantages for the customer, says Tim Clark, who does not want to risk the product and image of Emirates without need.But the young airline also recognizes its limits.
With United Airlines Emirates, the marketing alliance enables the North Atlantic and the USA.This market could only be tackled by the little airlines with losses.For United, Emirates closes the gap between London and Bangkok.

An Alouette II for the Verkehrshaus Lucerne / / MJM.Lucerne, 16. Mainach Renewal and redesign work is shining in new splendor.Especially from the field of commercial civil aviation - on the initiative and with the support of the Swissair, the Balair / CTA and the CrossAir - the permanent exhibition has been loaded with new pieces.
Various objects from military flying, including a “Hunter” cockpit, are also represented in the exhibition.The latest showpiece is extremely advantageous, a helicopter Alouette II, which was handed over to the traffic center to the traffic center after the liquidation of the Alouettes at the end of 1992 by the Federal Office for Military Affairs Spaces - a valuable addition to the military aviatic sector.Of the alouettes, which had been used for between 2500 and 4,000 flight hours, 30 were in two tranches at the time (1958: 10;
1964: 20).Admiring looks also deserve the new exhibits from the field of Swiss aircraft construction;Successful and thus atypical examples from an overall rather hapless industry (keyword: P16):
The first serial slide shield from 1985, which was merged from seven cells, are represented, the “Ailes de K” of the company of the same name in Morges, and a glider in duck construction, the booker “Canard Zfl” (1979).The Swiss muscle power aircraft “Pelargos III” by Horlacher (1983) will attract attention, in which an extremely small weight in connection with high aerodynamic quality was a basic requirement in order to be able to fly at all.New objects are one, the new production and updating of the existing are the other.
A diorama with the “Lockheed Orion” from 1932 and the Swiss flight pioneer Walter Mittelholzer, whose hundredth birthday was on April 2, is reminiscent of the beginnings of the Swissair.And an open blue box in the back of the hall enables the visitor to move in no time and without a time -consuming ocean flight for a desired destination.Pressure on the button is sufficient, and for a fee of CHF 2, the visitor can then carry home the freshly printed souvenir image of the selected place.

Privatization of Lufthansa confirmed / / gy.Bonn, 19.
Maidas Bonn's cabinet has gradually privatized the Deutsche Lufthansa AG.After a solution had already been found to decoupling the airline at the beginning of May for decoupling the airline, this is only the formal confirmation of the privatization intention that had been expressed for a long time.The company's collective bargaining partners and its supervisory board have now approved the new pension control.
For Lufthansa, the solution is of central importance, among other things, because the urgently needed capital increase can now be taken without the federal government.Appropriate applications for the Annual General Meeting of July 6th for approved capital are available.After the increase in the Lufthansa capital and the consent of the parliament, the federal government is "quickly" to sell his shares, which today make up 51.4 (after the capital increase 38) of the nominal capital and is currently a health value of goodCorresponding to 3 billion DM.
Like other participants, Wissmann also thought several tranches were possible in the sense of a “market -friendly” procedure and spoke out for a broad diversification of the titles.He did not rule out that Lufthansa could be completely privatized by the end of 1995.

British Airways distances global competition / / despite strong competition and generally poor business results in international air traffic, the British Airways airline has increased its annual profit by almost two thirds.As a result, the group's efforts are reflected in constantly reducing costs and increasing the income through alliances with other airlines and a constant improvement of the offer.
Ug.London, 23. Maidie from the management of British Airways (BA) pursued double strategy of constant reduction in costs and strengthening the income, has been reflected in a time in a time when the entire industry is deep in the red.In the 1993/94 financial year (completion at the end of March), the profit increased from tax by 63 % to £ 301 million;
In the same period, the group turnover rose by 13.2 % to £ 6.30 billion.This result, with a total loss of all airlines of 4.1 billion £ last year, referred to as "a very remarkable performance" by Chairman of the Board of Directors Colin Marshall, which, despite the existing violent international competition and the associated pressurewas achieved on the flight tariffs.The success that shows other airlines what can be achieved by a clearly defined business strategy may not only participate in shareholders who receive a final dividend of 7.92 P per share (which increases the annual dividend by 9.3 % to 11, 10 P results), but also the workforce, which is received an additional weekly wage as a profit share.
For some time, tight cost management that has been pursued by the management to reduce the costs that arise by around £ 150 million each year has been exceeded.Overall, the operating costs have now been reduced by better work practices, by constant pressure on the suppliers and by better utilization of the aircraft and the other assets.The alliances with other airlines, especially with USAir, have made cost savings (and additional income) of £ 10 million.
In the crime European Airlines, the strict BA-style restructuring is promoted, which is intended to reduce operating costs by around 30 %.Again, losses were created in both the crime and the German BA, but which failed with a total of £ 6 million than in the previous year (£ 11 million) and also compensated for by the prize in Qantas and the preferred dividend received by USAirbecome .The persistent financial problems of the partner company USAir will force BA to carry out a value adjustment in the participation in the books with £ 275.3 million, if it is not possible to carry out a comprehensive and accepted restructuring program by autumn.
At a press conference, however, Marshall emphasized that the partnership could be continued even when USIR had to look for protection from the creditors.In BA's books, a complete depreciation that would be necessary in the case of “Chapter 11” would not leave any too deep traces.Since the last capital increase, the debt coefficient has fallen by 10 points to 59.6 %;
The net debt was £ 2.70 billion at the end of the financial year, and equity has increased to £ 1.83 (1.21).More transported passenger shall emphasized that the group would continue to combine its efforts to contain the costs with measures to increase the income.According to general manager Robert Ayling, the focus will be on the foreground.
Last year, a £ 100 million program in the higher tariff areas had contributed to an increase in traffic volume by 6 % to improve the offer.Overall, the number of passengers transported rose by almost 9 % to 30.6 million, the freight promoted increased by 14 % to 607,000 t, and productivity rose by 8.2 %.Over the course of last year, the company terminated options for the purchase of 25 Boeing aircraft;

The space is becoming increasingly narrower at the Swissair / / at Zurich Airport.
With a fifth construction stage, the program of which is currently being developed by the airport partners under the leadership of the airport directorate, the necessary expansion and new buildings are to be provided.The Swissair will also realize its own project with an investment volume of around CHF 300 million.Zurich Airport is interpreted in its current state for coping with an advancement of around 14 million passengers per year.
In the past year, 13.4 million passengers used the airport.The theoretical load limit was almost reached.However, practice looks different.
Because the entrances and departures are not distributed evenly throughout the day, the systems are already overloaded on days with average traffic on days;On days with high frequencies, the highest improvisation is required to maintain an orderly company.The 1993 Airport Immobilien Society (FIG) writes in its 1993 annual report that various subsystems of the airport are busy at peak times to the limits of performance.
According to the conviction of Frank, head of the Swissair airport planning, immediate measures to remedy the bottlenecks are essential, because the intended expansion steps of the fifth construction stage can be put into operation at the earliest at the earliest at the earliest.TarmaC fully busy -dramatic conditions awaits Frank from next autumn on the apron, which means that the airport parking spaces in front of the airport head off the finger docks when the Crossair puts its new SAAB 2000 into operation.
The new aircraft has a larger wing span compared to the machines used today.In plain language: The SAAB 2000 - of course equipped with environmentally friendly engines - requires more space on the Tarmac that is not available.In the opinion of Swissair airport planner Frank, not only being remedied to secure an orderly company as part of the fifth construction stage.
Additional parking spaces are a compelling necessity despite the sophisticated management of the existing storage areas.There are bottlenecks in the morning and lunch tip also in the area of the handling switches.In Terminal B, at least 8 to 12 additional switches should be made available in Terminal B with immediate measures.
The luggage sorting system is also exhausted in the same terminal.Provisions to maintain an undisturbed company are essential after the head of the Swissair airport planning.Immediate measures to increase the performance of the airport are primarily in the decision -making area of the canton of Zurich as an airport holder.
The Swissair is willing to provide a considerable share of further airport expansion.Last but not least, she considers these intentions as a clear commitment to the home base.The building permit for a new Swissair aircraft setting is already spoken of.
The new shipyard building offers space to maintain four Airbuss;There is also the possibility of expanding the double capacity.The new hangar, which will cost around CHF 40 million in a simple design, is to be handed over to the company in 1996.
A Swissair catering new building from the Swissair has been submitted to the construction input for a new catering building.The on-board kitchen, an independent branch within the Swissair group, is awarded a considerable development potential.The new building serves to increase performance thanks to optimal operating processes.
In addition, today's, structurally and conceptually outdated catering buildings must give way to the future train station check-in, with which the handling switches for the air passengers are to be brought directly across the railway track.The new catering building is designed in two, with the possibility of being opened to increase an office punch.The construction is divided into production rooms and high -bay warehouse.
The latest technology and the most modern means of logistics are to be used in both areas.The operation in the new buildings should be able to be recorded in 1998/99.The investment volume is in the size of around CHF 140 million.
Around CHF 120 million are to be invested in the infrastructure systems of the extended cargo facilities.The corresponding procurement orders are granted, they are fogged in the equipment for the container handling and the small cargo and in particular the IT equipment of the entire system.Before that, Frank is convinced that, despite the (present) offside of Switzerland of Europe, the Zurich Airport has a good chance of remaining attractive if, in addition to additional efforts in the area of Europe, the existing possibilities are perceived.

Adjustment of the infrastructure of the airport / / (AI) The government council requests the cantonal council to adapt a loan of CHF 19 million for the adaptation of work management, stands, roller paths, roller paths and streets in the area of the newly created on the airport site.The Swissair's border service building was put into operation in 1961 and has been expanded in various ways since then.
With today's systems, a production increase is no longer possible, and they are no longer sufficient for technical and security and environmental protection requirements.The Swissair is therefore planning a new building right next to the current on -board service building.The new building means that various infrastructure systems of the canton have to be adjusted.
This means that surgical improvements on roller paths and stands can be realized at the same time.At the costs of CHF 26 million, Swissair makes a contribution of CHF 7 million Automatic control sign bearing for replacement of the computer -aided automatic signage camp in the road traffic office, the government council has granted a loan of CHF 2.07 million.The previous system, a individual production, has been in operation since the building in the Albisgütli was commissioned in 1973.
It is to be replaced because it can only automatically edit the unit format of the control signs at the time and is very prone to repair.The new system can edit all signs in the same warehouse system.The signs can be called up from the switch via screen:
They are brought to the call location via an automatic conveying system.In 1993 the maximum stock of vehicles was over 676,000. At times, over 100,000 vehicle signs were deposited in the road traffic office.
At the end of September, the new location for the civil servant insurance fund will move from the rented rooms on Nüschelerstrasse in Zurich to the state -owned property Stampfenbachstrasse 63 at the end of September.A loan of CHF 3.9 million was approved for the expansion of the rooms, the renovation of facades, atrium, stairwell and terrace.The rooms are rented to the city of Zurich by the end of June.
She no longer needs these rooms.Prevention of air vigorous government council has approved a loan of CHF 4.8 million at the expense of the aircraft noise fund to secure roof tiles in the municipality of Stadel.The roof tiles must be secured with brackets to prevent personal damage from preventing people and property damage, which could result from rush-having aircraft.

The Allies dominate the airspace / / 1944 The Second World War entered its decisive phase: the recaptation of France by the Allies.
Blick employee and military specialist Marcel H. Keiser tells the bloody fight, which began in Normandy on June 6th.Today: Allied planes destroy the dreams of Feldmarschall Rommel.
Hitler wants to know from a general staff officer who has returned from Normandy how many German planes have counted in the use of it."Two hunters between Paris and Chartres," replies the Colonel Keck.That comes pretty close to the truth.
The Allies dominate the sky almost undisturbed over France.At Le Mans, her fighter bombers of 200 German tanks skyrocket in a very short time.The command center of the West Panzer Group is completely destroyed, almost all important staff officers fall.
Field marshal Rommel must give up hope for a massive counterattack.Even individual vehicles are attacked, including Rommel's car.His seriously injured driver races into a tree, the field marshal is pulled out of the rubble with a broken skull.
In May he had advised with General Karl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, the military commander in France, whether Hitler could not be captured and judged.On June 10, the Nazis will brutally react to actions of the French resistance movement (Résistance).The SS tank division “Das Reich” drives all 600 inhabitants of the village of Oradour-sur-Glâne and slows down.
The place is burned down.In the Cherbourg, which was explained to the fortress, Lieutenant General Karl-Wilhelm von Schlieben: «Anyone who thinks of the White flag will be shot immediately!»When his own bunker begins to crumble under the shelling of the Americans broken out of their now secured bridgeheads, he surrendered on June 26.
The port is totally destroyed and can only be put back into operation in August.At the end of June, 8,50000 Allied soldiers marched in Normandy.A good two million are still ready in the UK.
Because he got peace in view of the hopeless situation, Feldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt as commander -in -chief West is replaced by Hans Günther von Kluge.But Hitler still believes in an apparent attack and awaits the main punch on the Pas de Calais.American fighter planes bomb the French city of Cherbourg.

KLM win with the help of “Pension Ferien” / / PMR.Amstelveen, 2nd Junidie Dutch airline KLM wrote back black in the 1993/94 financial year.For the future, she relies on a further expansion of her own position as a "global carrier" for the future, but remains interested in working with other medium -sized societies.
However, there are currently no concrete contacts, since all companies are busy with their own reorganization and the perspectives on the European market are uncertain in view of the powdering liberalization.In 1993 increased flexibility clm was profit of 103 million HFL.After a loss of 562 million Hfl.
shown in the previous year.The improvement, which occurred, especially in the second half of the year, is thanks to the transport performance that has grown well above average with 17 %.However, a significant part of these savings is based on an agreement on the end of 1994 with the staff, according to which KLM has not needed any premiums to the pension fund since April 1993.
Through these “pension holidays”, the airline has saved 291 million HFL in the past twelve months.Above all, a gain in flexibility is hoped for by the first operational leasing of seven Boeing 767 aircraft, which will replace ten Airbus 310 next year.Bouw justified this change in the fleet composition with the greatly increased flight frequency on the European routes after the introduction of the block system, which requires smaller machines with more versatile possible uses.
With a increase in sales from 5 % to 8.7 billion HFL.the operating result of 96 million Hfl.At 467 million Hfl.
The shortfall from investments decreased by 388 million HFL.on 2 million Hfl.
The share of 20 % in the American Society of Northwest, which has shown positive results for three quarters and was fully written off by KLM last year, had no influence on this result.Due to the stocking of the stock of this year and the output of participation certificates to the workforce, the equity of 2.17 billion HFL.to 3.57 billion Hfl.increases what corresponds to 28 (i. 20)% of total assets.
KLM sees itself as one of the best -capitalized airlines and hopes that this is how the financing costs of 381 (348) million.to be able to stabilize in the past year.Slightly weaker traffic growth?
Bouw did not want to make a precise forecast about the prospects for the current year.The average growth of traffic performance, which was twice as high at 10.3 % in the past three years as on average in the industry, will probably weaken a little, but then the level of utilization of 72.7 (69.6)% further.However, the Dutch want to defend their European market share, which increased from 4.2 % to 5.5 % last year.
However, around 20 % of Europe affect the total traffic performance of the KLM.In 1993, the production of the KLM increased by 12 % to 9136 million TKM and the transport performance by 17 % to 6642 million TKM.The average yield continued to shrink by 8 % to HFL.

New state system for Lugano Agno / / (Mit.) The Lugano Agno airfield receives a modern instrument landing system.During the renovation, the transport aircraft fly the airfield with radar aid.
Because larger safety margins apply, there may be a few delays in difficult weather conditions.Today's instrument landing system (ILS) in Lugano is around 20 years old, and spare parts procurement is becoming increasingly difficult.The old ILS facility was closed on June 6th.

Air traffic again on a steep growth course?/ / The latest market study for civilian world air traffic at Boeing Commercial Airplane Group forecast for the second half of the nineties and the following decade a return to the former growth course.For the next twenty years, Boeing estimates the need for new commercial aircraft at around 14,000 with a value of $ 980 billion.
Three quarters of the new jets are said to cover growth -related needs, while a quarter serves to replace old aircraft.Fewer orders and deliveries.After the boom in the late 1980s, the civil aviation has had the three worst years of their previous history:
From 1990 to 93, according to the IATA, Airlines lost over $ 15 billion in line traffic alone.Since many airlines had only generated modest yields even in the previous good times, they had to cancel or at least postpone orders.In addition, at the end of 1993, 857 mostly older jets were still on the ground worldwide.
The manufacturers of large passenger aircraft are particularly affected by this negative development.You have to produce jets for a very small customer group of around 600 airlines with a lifespan of twenty and more years.The small number of customers have large scope for the replacement of existing aircraft, while the manufacturers are forced to plan the production capacities provided as precisely as possible.
If the three large manufacturers, Boeing, Airbus Industry and McDonnell Douglas, at the end of the eighties hardly where there were more than a thousand new orders every year, the orders have been clear since the outbreak of the Gulf War: in 1992 there were still 470 new orders forJets and in 1993 still 392. The number of aircraft delivered also testifies to the current surplus in civil aviation.In 1992 the airlines took over 844 new aircraft, in 1993 it was 629 and in the current year you still expect 520 - 540 deliveries.
The production rates have also been reduced on almost all montage lines and thousands of employees were released.But based on previous data at Boeing, one is convinced that the demand for flight services will level off on the long -term growth trend as soon as the global economy experiences a new upswing.Forecast by 2 % down
Corrected boing assumes an annual growth of air traffic by 5.9 % by the turn of the millennium, which will subsequently weaken to 4.9 % per year by 2013.In Seattle, it is assumed that air traffic will grow more faster than the global economy as a whole as a relatively young industry.For the latter, Boeing accepts 3 % for 1994 and 3.4 % annually until the end of the decade.
This assumption is about 2 % below the forecasts of the previous year because the economy in Europe and Japan is slowly recovering.However, even in these requirements, air traffic would double from 1994 to 2005 and almost tripled by 2013.The growth will not be spread over the individual markets evenly.
China is at the top with an annual growth of over 10 percent.Around 40 percent of the forecast gain for the forecast from 1994 to 2013 is eliminated by the air traffic from and to Asia.
According to the forecast, internal American traffic will increase by 20 %, the North Atlantic participates with 9 %, and the growth share of Europe is around 10 %. High demand for jets with 120 - 170 seats, most new aircraft will be in the next twenty years in the opinion of BoeingClass 120 - 170 seats needed, followed by the large -scale aircraft with more than 350 seats.At the end of 1993, 6778 jets were counted with 70 - 170 places.Even taking into account better utilization in the equivalent of 700 aircraft in the coming years, Boeing still sees an additional need of 1200 jets for the next twenty years.
The question of how many of the old aircraft are pulled out of circulation at what point in time is difficult to answer in detail.A fixed point is certainly December 31, 1999, because the American “Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990” has set this limit to all airplanes approved in the USA that fall into the so -called “Stage 2” from noise emissions.Half of all today's category 70-170 seats belongs to this category, and half of all Stage 2 aircraft are in the service of American airlines.
In Europe, the end of the noisy Boeing 727 and 737 of the first generation as well as the DC-9 is also foreseeable.The retrofitting of engines (Hush Kit) only met with limited demand for the airlines, because this means that the noise regulations (Stage 3) can be met, but the high fuel consumption and the high costs for maintenance do not allow them to be eliminated.Not only noise regulations, but also the old age is a problem for these aircraft:
In 1999 a sixth of today's short and medium-haul jets would be more than 30 years old.And the jets in the desert?One may object, there were still considerable capacities on jets in the desert.
Of the 557 aircraft for short and medium-sized distances that are on the ground in the desert or anywhere else, no hundred noise regulations according to the stage 3. Even if all Stage 3 jets are taken back into service, the forecast of Boeing is requiredMore than 3000 other jets in this class.The manufacturers would therefore have to deliver around 600 jets a year, twice the annual production.
A look at previous Boeing market forecasts shows that there were short-term deviations due to individual events (oil crises, wars), but which could not break the long-term (growth) trend.Less new freighter boing expects around 2.5 % fewer new freight aircraft than in previous forecasts.On the one hand, new capacities are added to passenger aircraft, on the other hand, the erosion of yield forces more cost -effective solutions.
According to losses of 7 % (1992) and 10 % (1993), the yields from freight traffic should stabilize in the current year.The narrow yield base at the freight increases the airlines to convert old and cheap passenger aircraft in freighter instead of buying new freighter.The DC-8 and Boeing 707 are previous examples of this fleet policy.

Ten-year program for airport expansion / / (AI) The government council applies to the Cantonal Council for the referendum to approve a loan of CHF 873 million for the execution of the 5th airport construction stage.This construction stage, which is to be realized in the next ten years, includes the following parts: expansion of the roller paths, overtaking traces and provision areas for the aircraft, construction of the new finger dock «Midfield» with the associated personnel transport and infrastructure systems, improvement of the landing development (expansion of theSBB station to a station terminal, laying and expansion of the bus courtyard, adaptations for private traffic) as well as adaptation of supply and disposal, in particular systems for the treatment of winter waste water.
The total costs are CHF 2.093 billion due to a cost estimate.These costs are distributed to the canton, the airport real estate company (FIG), the Swissair and the SBB.As a airport holder, the canton is responsible for the civil engineering work and the infrastructure as well as for the buildings, which it only uses alone (CHF 873 million).
The FIG creates the buildings of the passenger and freight setting (CHF 975 million), the Swissair places the operating installations for the plants (CHF 202 million) it operates, and the SBB is expected to no longer apply for around CHF 43 million in connection with the station terminal, wherebyis still being negotiated on the cost division between FIG and SBB.Various important parts of the airport have reached their capacity limits or already exceeded their capacity limits.In the daily and seasonal peak times, the systems are overloaded.
The traffic growth predicted for the coming years will still exacerbate this situation, so that an expansion of the infrastructure is required.The existing slopes remain unchanged.The increase in performance of the airport is particularly sought through the construction of overtaking tracks (bypasses) and the expansion of the systems for the handling of aircraft, passengers and freight.
Environmental protection is given great weight, which is also evident in the expansion of the plants for country transport.The prerequisite for the in attack of the 5th construction stage is that the cantonal loan is approved by the voters.The costs incurred on the canton are passed on to the airport users as part of the operating invoice.

The Financial Miser of the Olympic Airways / / PS.Athens, 6th Julidie
State Greek airline Olympic Airways (OA) has long been struggling with financial and structural problems (see NZZ No. 29).According to the local newspaper reports, your deficit is currently around 500 billion Dr.(about 2.7 billion Fr.).A request for Athens regarding the repayment of the OA's debt is concerned with the European Union (EU).
Brussels makes the repayment of the debt of measures to secure the life capacity of the company and on the guarantee of free competition.The conditions of Brussels include the abolition of the OA privilege in the internal network, compliance with certain tariff regulations in the next four years and the supervision by an EU commissioner.The Greek government considers these requirements too hard.
She speaks of an attempt to put the OA under the guardianship of Brüssels.The matter is still a counterpart.A decision by the EU is expected next week.
According to a study that was submitted to the OA's Board of Directors in May, the company's deficit results from the state's politics itself.The main thesis in the study written by the aviation specialist Lainos is that the OA even gained a net profit of 377 440 at the end of 1992If the state, the company's only shareholder, had not disregarded the contract with the OA and inflicted financial damage to the airline.Lainos complains about the non -deposit of a large part of the share capital, the losses due to stimulating discounts for various citizens' categories (e.g. for military, university lecturers, etc.), the free flights of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, the reductions for the transport of the daily pressAnd the magazines, the non -incomprehensing of invoices to various ministries and other public bodies that imposed the company forced to the company in domestic traffic and the losses due to non -covered services to parties and voters in elections.
The explanations in the study mentioned may need critical review in this or that.Its core is, however, in this respect, in this respect, as he reveals that the state has repeatedly violated the elementary principle of profitability in the airline.It should still be taken into account that the OA has served the ruling for many years as a “refuge” for the employment of party policy clientele.
In view of this situation, those local critics of official traffic policy gain ground that a privatization of the OA (actually a reprivatization, because the company was originally an Aristotle onassis).In the government circles, however, there is no such development or at least not yet.Much depends on the excited decision of Brüssels.

"Airport 2000" - for 2 billion / / Kloten ZH - Spectacular expansion plans are those responsible for the Zurich Kloten Airport:
A state -of -the -art “Airport 2000” is to be built for over two billion francs.These are the main elements of the 5th expansion stage: · A train station terminal with integrated check-in systems.That is a world first.
It offers optimal handling conditions for passengers who come to the flight by train: no tedious luggage around the luggage.The connection to the existing terminals A and B is intended to secure a powerful train.Departure times: every 2 to 3 minutes.
Minimum capacity in both directions per hour: 2,800 people. · A new traffic connection geared towards public transport. · An improved roller path system so that the large space jets get past each other better.In detail: a more powerful transport system for people, freight, catering (flight catering) and luggage.
The earliest construction is in 1998. The prerequisite for this is that the voters of the canton of Zurich Gutheissen the required loan of CHF 873 million.The airport real estate company, 202 million, would have to contribute 975 million to the Swissair and 43 million SBB.
The construction period is estimated for 10 years.Martin Meier model of the “Midfield” finger dock.Below: A train connects the dock with the terminals A and B.

Airport 2002 / / The government council, together with the airport partners at a press conference, presented the template for the 5th construction stage of the Zurich Airport, for which a cantonal loan of CHF 873 million is requested with a referendum template.The FIG, Swissair and the SBB are also participating in the total costs of over CHF 2 billion.
Provided political approval, the project could be realized at the start of construction from 1998 to 2002.“Airport 2000” is on the brochure, in which the plans and numbers for the 5th construction stage of the Zurich Airport are compiled.We derived “Airport 2002” from it because, according to the scheduled schedule at the beginning of the construction work in 1998, the company recording could take place in 2002 - provided that the project finds political approval in the canton and the essentially regulated approval process can be found withoutComplete larger complications.
Seven speakers competed on Tuesday to present and explain the expansion plans at a large information event: District President Hedi Lang as Economic Director, Government Councilor Eric Honegger as financial director, the director of the Federal Office for Civil Affairs, André Auer, the Directorate President of Swissair, Otto LoepfDirector of the Airport Immobilien Society (FIG), Hanspeter Brütsch, Airport Director Hans Peter Staffelbach and the deputy airport director Alfred Ruh, while Daniel Spörri, as deputy airport director, headed the orientation.At the borders of the capacity government President Lang recalled that in 1985, with the commissioning of finger dock A, the last expansion of the airport was completed.
Since then, traffic has increased significantly, namely around 35 % of flight movements and by 40 % each with passengers and in the freight.Capacity limits are reached in different areas, such as the aircraft stands and the roller paths and also in the handling systems for the passengers.According to the concession granted by the federal government, the canton has to ensure the orderly handling of the airport company;
However, this is only possible with an expansion with further growth of air traffic.A master plan as a framework for the further development of the airport, supplemented by an environmental balance sheet and an air program based on it, was approved by the government council in 1992.With the rejection of the “Volks initiative for Major Air Transport” in September 1993, voters created the political prerequisite for further planning work.
A project commission was used, and no less than 17 engineering offices have subsequently created construction concepts and cost estimates for the various objects of the 5th expansion stage, so that the government council was able to pass the loan template for the cantonal investment share on June 22.As the government president stated, the government council is part of Zurich Airport, which as a air traffic center for the canton and for large parts of Switzerland is of eminent economic importance, and he is convinced that this will also do the cantonal council and the population.The parts of the 5th construction stage 5. Building stage belong to the following parts: -The roller path system along the three slopes, which is “middle” with the new finger docking uptake and is supplemented with a so-called bypass (overhaul) pistons 16 and provision areas to the slopes 16 and 28. The finger dock «Mitte» (or Midfield)
Charge for 18 to 27 aircraft (depending on the size). The area is opened with a rhinestone tunnel, a luggage tunnel and a media channel for the supply lines.-a connecting lane (also called People Mover) from the airport head along the finger dock «center» .-The station terminal, where 60 handling switches are installed in an extensively underground station hall, so that the air passengers arriving in the train can be cut from the train to Check3-in., Waiting rooms and a arrival hall. The new freight import center, side-side to today's freight Ost.-the parking garage C as a new building with around 2,800 places (including 600 as a replacement for noise parking spaces, so that a "net profit" of 2200 parking spaces results in) a new central bus stop beforeDemarkhaus B.-Schilfteiche for the biological treatment of the water-sausage water. One expansion of the workshop and locking connection to the airport on the Seiterümlang, which can also be opened by the future goods handling center Rümlang (for air freight rash by train).
Regardless of the 5th construction stage, the following systems are to be created: a new luggage sorting system, replacement stands West, a bypass to slopes 28, the expansion of the cargo system East (loans approved), a freight test system (security check), a system for checking the registered luggage,A new FIG heating center, an extension to the surgical center for the Swisscontrol, a new on-board service building for the Swissair, supply and disposal systems, a new company and workshop building of the FIG and a new hangar of the Swissair.Insofar as the canton is investing investment costs of more than CHF 2 million (civil engineering and infrastructure) for individual objects, the cantonal council will be submitted separate.Capacities and loads 5. Building stage is aimed at the following capacities (in brackets 1993): Flight movements in line and charter traffic 220,000 (197,000);
Passengers 20 million (13.5 million);Fracht including air freight substitute traffic 650,000 tons (377,000 tons).This means that the possible full expansion has not yet been achieved in 1992;
This is geared towards 250,000 movements, 23 million passengers and 750,000 tons of freight.With the measures intended in the partial airport of the cantonal air program, the environmental impact is hoped to be able to reduce the environmental pollution despite the expansion.The Swissair makes a significant contribution to the modernization of its fleet:
The new generation of Airbusse for short and medium-distance operation has engines with a much lower pollutant outlet than the previous models.The federal government is also applied for the creation of legal foundations for the introduction of a steering tax to reduce pollutant emissions.The design of the roller path system should enable the operation to be optimized so that the engine running times on the ground are as short as possible.
The airport's development by public transport is to be improved.With the help of the new station terminal, the proportion of passengers who arrive by train is to be increased.The expansion of the central bus stop should be a prerequisite for the establishment of additional regional bus lines.
With the 5th construction stage, advance going will also be hit for the connection of the airport to the planned “Medium distributor Glattal” - a train from Stettbach via Valaisellen and Officon to the airport.The additional regional traffic connections should also serve the increasing number of airport employees and visitor traffic.As far as aircraft noise is concerned, new stress limit values are determined as part of the Environmental Protection Act and the noise protection ordinance of the federal government.
The new noise fee model, which was set into force in autumn 1993, should lead to the proportion of noise -efficient machines.Due to a regulation of the Federal Council, the most noisy types of beam planes are no longer approved at Swiss airports in the foreseeable future.By balance, the additional traffic expected with the airport expansion should not increase, but rather to reduce noise pollution around the airport, even if it is admitted that the subjective perception will not necessarily register this.
No burden on taxpayers can the canton of Zurich afford the intended investments in the airport in today's bad financial situation?Finance director Honegger affirmed this question, since no taxpayers' money is necessary;Because the users of the airport have fully covered the costs in recent years, including the interest and amortization of the invested capital, and the state treasury has accumulated more than CHF 60 million in net profit from the airport bill.
If you take this amount into account, the airport will continue to cover its full costs over the whole, even if negative invoices are temporarily expected due to the investment for the 5th construction stage.In order to secure the cost recovery, fees will have to be increased.So far, the federal government was responsible for this;
Due to the new Aviation Act, however, the edges can now set passenger and landing fees themselves, and the federal government only wakes up that no abusive fees are charged.Zurich Airport is moving in midfield compared to foreign airports in relation to the amount of the fee, so that the necessary scope should exist for financing the investments.You hardly need to say words about the economic importance of airport.
In connection with the 5th construction stage, however, the eminent economic importance of an investment volume of over CHF 2 billion must be pointed out for the Zurich economy.On the name of the Swissair Group, Directorate President Otto Loepfe underlined the high importance of a powerful and contemporary home base in the international competition of the airlines.In cooperation with the train, he sees a pioneering performance by Swissair and Zurich Airport.
The Swissair not only relies on the canton and Fig, but will also invest around half a billion francs in buildings and plants at Zurich airport in the next few years;It will also refinance a significant part of the 5th construction stage as a tenant and the fees.That is why it also works for rigorous cost management when planning and realizing the 5th construction stage.
The director of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, André Auer, underlined that the federal government as a concession agency will contribute to this so that the work can be realized quickly.Swiss air traffic policy, for which the outdoor relationships have become difficult in view of the referendums recently, can only achieve the goal of good international connections if the expansion of the state airports keeps pace.Objects and costs of the 5th construction stage (millions of francs)

Airport expansion / / With impressive unity, the Zurich voters voted in September 1993 to ensure that the development opportunities for the airport should be preserved.This was a fundamental decision to which the government council reacted quickly with the specific application for the next stage of the airport expansion.
Nevertheless, the development boost now intended may come a little surprising for some.But you have to keep the temporal dimensions in mind: Almost 20 years ago, the buildings of the 3rd stage of the airport were put into operation with Terminal B and the airport station, supplemented in 1985 by finger dock A, with which the main operations on thePage of the flying dough could be improved.
The systems of a further expansion stage will be available in 2002 at the earliest.Then essential capacity -determining parts of the Zurich Airport will be more than a quarter of a century old.The planned expansion can therefore not be designated as premature or translated as translated.
The 5th construction stage can be compared in the size of the size with the 3rd construction stage.A major difference is that there is no expansion of the slopes: This gives the capacity limit of a maximum of 60 flight movements (starts or landings) an hour.
It is about the future optimal use of this capacity, and since in Kloten there are no land reserves for adding new terminals at the airport head, you are forced to compress structures that cost your price.The measures that must be provided to limit the environmental impact are also important: Around 200 million francs, for example, cost the systems for central aircraft rapid and the biological treatment of ducks.
The discussions about the economic importance of the airport for the canton of Zurich and Switzerland to par excellence Pro and Contra Air traffic were widespread a year ago.You shouldn't have to be repeated anymore.After all, with regard to the 5th construction stage for the airport, you will also have to keep in mind, which means specifically an investment volume of CHF 2 billion for the economy and the jobs in the canton of Zurich.
But how should the question of the affiliation be answered?The cost and earnings calculations have shown that even for the future with full cost recovery by the users of the airport may be expected: No tax money will have to be used in other words.
One could count themselves lucky in Switzerland if all investment projects for public transport had such a good financing basis.In the integration policy decisions of the recent times, the Swiss mostly took the view that we are efficient enough in our country to be able to go our own way.With regard to air traffic policy, this means that Switzerland actually has to make considerable efforts in order to be able to maintain its position with the offer of advanced institutions.

A springbock to five continents / / the abolition of apartheid and the first free elections in South Africa, which could be held last April, have heralded a new age for South African Airways.After the airline was only able to operate under highly difficult conditions for decades, it is now, in the 60th year of its existence, the world in the truest sense of the word.
The most drastic date in the history of South African Airways (Saa) is certainly August 22, 1963 when the black African states withdraw the overflow rights.From one day on the other, the airline was forced to either cancel its courses to Europe or fly around the African continent.In view of the sanctions, the South African Airways responsible had previously designed possible scenarios in order not to affect air traffic.
On an Atlantic route along the west coast of Africa, suitable airports for reconconuation (Luanda, Cape Verdish Islands and Las Palmas) of the Boeing-707 units as well as for any emergency landings were sought and found, so that after the fatal August 1963The only course had to be canceled.As a “Round the Bulge Operation”, this company went down in history and was valid until the early nineties.A few milestone dormans to the detour and the associated competitive disadvantages - the flight time to Europe increased by average three hours - the South African airline managed to keep up with the requirements of the time and also set some milestones in the civil aviation.
For example, in 1969, when the world's first line connection from South Africa could be introduced to North and South America via the South Atlantic.In 1971 South African Airways as the first company in the world took up the Boeing 747 Super B, equipped with the advanced JT9D 7W engines, and in 1976 as one of the Launching Customers of the Boeing 747 SP, laid the record flight over 16 510 kilometers from Seattle to Cape Town in 17Hours and 22 minutes back.The Boeing 747 SP (Special Performance) is a smaller version of the Boeing 747 - 200 with a larger range.
In 1983 South African Airways was the first company in Africa to use the Boeing 747 - 300 Sud (Stretched Upper Deck) and was the first airline to run non -stop between Johannesburg and London.Despite all the difficulties, South African Airways managed to confirm among the leading airlines in the world, even when the United States in 1986 and Australia also withdrawn traffic rights in the course of global sanctions against South Africa.In the 1988/89 financial year, the airline transported over five million passengers for the first time.
With the dawn of the nineties, the most important changes came into force for South African Airways: in April 1990 the airline became part of the Transnet group.This is an originally non -profit state company that in 1992 in a public company under the name Transnet Ltd.
was converted.This holding company is subordinate to various subsidiaries from transport, transport, freight and oil production industry as well as the travel and telecommunications industry.However, these companies do not receive any state subsidies.
At the end of the sanctions after 28 years in 1991, in addition to the preservation of the first of a total of four Boeing 747-400 units, also marked the normalization of relationships between South Africa and the community of states.With various countries, new air traffic agreements could be concluded, which also made it possible to operate South African Airways to operate again on the direct air line to Europe on a new west route over the African continent and a few months later.However, the main event of 1991 was the reintroduction of three weekly connections between Johannesburg and New York on November 3.
Air traffic to Australia (Sydney and Perth) was resumed in January 1992.In the meantime, the “flying springboard”, the heraldic animal of the South African airline, can be found on all five continents.Totally, 9 domestic, 15 African and 22 intercontinental destinations are currently being offered;
The Destination Dubai has been the latest destination since October 1993.There are currently over 20 non-stop connections per week between South Africa and Europe.A Boeing 747 starts from Zurich every Monday and Saturday evening to Johannesburg;
The Saturday course has been continued to Cape Town since April 2, 1994, and from October 1, 1994 you will also be able to benefit on the Monday connection.The flight time is around ten and a half hours or a good thirteen hours today.It will be 37 years in December 1994 since the Limmatstadt in the route network of South African Airways was figured.
Compared to Swissair, the South African carrier specifies a market share of 32 percent.Around a quarter of the passengers are business travelers.The South African Airways fleet currently includes a Boeing 767 - 200, four Boeing 747 - 400, two Boeing 747 - 300, five Boeing 747 - 200, five Boeing 747 -SP, eight Airbus A -300, seven Airbus A -320 andThirteen Boeing 737 - 200.
South African Airways thus operates a quarter of all Boeing units on the African continent.To the delight of aviators, the airline still has a JU 52, DC-4, DC-3 and a Harvard, all of which are used for charter, promotional flights and air shows.Air slide for the southern African Jan Smut Airport in Johannesburg is not only the home base of South African Airways, but a gateway that under the new political situation of the country is predicted a great future as an Aviatic hub for the entire southern Africa.
In 1990 there were only 20 airlines that headed Johannesburg, this number has now increased to 45.A recently opened Domestic terminal now also contributes to the fact that the passenger flows can flow efficiently.In addition, Jan Smut's Airport has one of the most modern maintenance and service centers from all over Africa, where with around 3000 employees in addition to the control and repair of their own aircraft, maintenance orders for other airlines are also carried out;
The German Lufthansa recently won as a weighty customer.Code sharing agreement contrary to the domestic routes, where a two-class system is offered on board, the airline uses a three-class configuration on the long-distance connections: Blue Diamond (First Class), Gold Class (Business Class) and Silver Class (Economy Class).South African Airways maintains so-called code sharing agreements on some routes;
For example with American Airlines between New York and Johannesburg, flown with SAA device;In addition, with the Brazilian Varig between Johannesburg and Bangkok, with Varig machine;There is also an agreement with Austrian Airlines between Vienna and Johannesburg, whereby AUA aircraft is used.
Economically, South African Airways has gone through a difficult time in recent years.The recession started in South Africa in 1989 and drove flight operations deep into the red.As with other airlines, layoffs and early retirement could hardly be avoided, but also paved the way for new employees of any skin color on the executive floors.

Military flight pilot instead of lubricant display / / met.Lugano, in July from the radar crossing on Lugano Agno in July, nothing will be for the sake.
Captain Armando Albisetti, who directed the Saab Fairchild 340 of the Crossair 904 course from Zurich towards Sottoceneri, would like to do his favor.But the tower in Lugano waves off because a "Jumbolino" of the same company in Agno should have been waiting for the departure.This is how our plane is released by the pilots in Milan - you are responsible for the airspace south of Monte Ceneri - for a viewing trip from your care.
The path leads from the north over the square, then further south to 6000 feet to the Pinik reporting point, where the large 180-degree left curve is initiated.To the east of Monte San Salvatore, it goes north again before the end of the Massagno area is turned onto the slope axis.From afar, in addition to a roller path, the mobile, field-gray radar «houses» and the rotating antennas of the army flight controllers are visible, the services of which we are not allowed to use.New instrument landing system ILS that was installed in June.
The old one had to be replaced because the spare parts procurement became increasingly difficult.In order to ensure the flight planned traffic during the construction and test phase, the Federal Office for Military Air Panels (BAMF) has set up a military landadar system on behalf of the Federal Office of Civil Aviation and ensures the final flights with its own flight safety officers.During our visit to the air -conditioned trailer, which houses the radar console, a retired air traffic control officer from the Dübendorf airfield and a younger colleague from Payerne are doing.
Service here is primarily willingness, because the two have been used only rarely.The reason for this is mostly good weather;In this case, the crews, especially those with good local knowledge, prefer the more economical viewing dance.
In poor visibility, however, the services of the military pilots can become essential.The “Visibility” must not decrease over too deep values;If the approaching crews cannot recognize the piste threshold from a distance of 3 miles, a radar -guided final approach is no longer permitted.
So you are happy in the tower in Lugano and at the Crossair that in these weeks there is mostly good weather with the corresponding visibility, so that time and cost-intensive evasive maneuvers according to Milan have failed.Radar -controlled final flights result from the leadership accuracy, which is lower compared to instrument landing.Military air traffic controllers have to lead you to the crew entrusted with information on the remaining flight route and to the side of the slope threshold with information on the remaining flight route and the remaining shots.
On the board side, the location shown in an instrument is still missing in an instrument compared to the ideal lubricant.It also includes the Lugano Agno airfield because of its location in a valley boiler surrounded by hills and mountains, only in one direction open basin and because of the short slopes (1300 meters) in any case.At 6.65 degrees, the sliding path is exceptionally steep, for the slope 14 in Zurich (normal) 3
Degree .Occupations that want to benefit from the minimum views of the minimal views and clouds must therefore show about having completed two instrument flights in the past six months.The collaboration phase of civil and military air traffic control comes to an end in Lugano these days.
Michele Montanari, head of the air traffic control in Lugano, draws a very positive balance;Aircraft crews also praised the new service of the aircraft in this form.At the end of next week, it is planned that the Approach should be possible again on the conventional ILS sliding path.

Cloudy ratio of the Sabena with Air France / / Met.Brussels, July 12, spring 1992, Air France got on with the Belgian Aviation Sabena Aviation;
Together with three Belgian financial groups, she acquired a share of 37.5 % in the chronically weak carrier.Until the autumn 1993, the cooperation with the French partner fulfilled expectations that the hoped-for synergies had become effective, especially in Africa traffic, emphasized the Sabena CEO, Pierre Godfroid.With the resignation of Air France boss Attali in the episode of the strike last autumn last autumn, however, the situation has changed suddenly.
Although Air France has so far fulfilled the financial obligations of the Sabena received, and there are no signs that this does not also apply to the capital injection of 1 billion BFR that is due this month.apply.However, the conversation with the partner, who is apparently too busy with his own problems, has now become difficult, and the cooperation does not develop at all, was literally "frozen".This condition is unsustainable for the Sabena, whose new leadership has set itself in the markets of Europe and Africa ambitious goals.
Until after the holidays, they wanted to know in Brussels how the French want to keep it with the partnership received in the future.Godfroid also commented on the efforts of the Sabena, which is severely under -capitalized, to improve their capital structure through new partnerships;He speaks of a financial requirement of 7 to 8 billion BFR.
There is no lack of interested parties, but from his words it was easy to see that the Swissair would be the desired partner.The fact that the Sabena is willing to expand its apparently successful code sharing community (New York and Atlanta) with the American Delta Airlines would go with Swissair, which is connected to this US carrier in the Quality Alliance, in the eyes of Godfroidsonly make more attractive.Godfroid did not provide any specific information on the state of discussions with the Swiss airline - with the exception of a collaboration in the catering area apparently assessed by both sides as an interesting cooperation.

Improved chances of Swissair at Sabena?/ / pmr.Brussels, 28.
Julider Belgian Transport Minister Elio Di Rupo sees the European Commission's decision on the subsidy package for Air France new scope for movement for his national airline Sabena.The bans on other airlines also include the requirements of the Brussels authority of the battered French society to buy “new participations” in other airlines by the end of 1996.The Air France, according to Minister Di Rupo, is thus bound by the hands in the urgently needed capital topping of the Belgian crow flies.
Constant relationship with the Air Francedie Air France, together with three Belgian financial groups, acquired 37.5 % of Sabena capital together with three Belgian financial groups.Since the presidential change at the French society in Brussels, however, it has not been well to speak to the collaboration.Sabena boss Godfroid instead opened openly with the participation of the more capitalized Swissair.
Despite their need for money, the French have so far opposed and even firmly agreed that the last capital tranche of 1 billion BFR., which will still be pending from the participation agreement in the spring of 1992, in time for July 31st in Brussels. "Before the third"? In the case of future capital increases by Sabena, which is particularly necessary in view of an equity ceiling of only 11 % of the balance sheet totalHowever, according to the EC Commission's requirements, Air France do not go along.
Minister Di Rupo therefore only sees two options: either Paris is offset by the Sabena share or becomes a "sleeeping partner" who dispenses with an active management role and thus the way to a "marriage to three" to participate a third partner,Free power.The minister expects a decision in mid -September.
At this point in time, a study that he commissioned together with the Air France at the Banque Lazard should be completed.This study revolves around two questions.On the one hand, the current state of cooperation and synergies between the French and the Belgian airline is to be worked out.
On the other hand, the experts should calculate how much fresh capital the Sabena needs to survive.According to Di Rupo, he had the word of Air France President Blanc that a clear decision would be made after the study was completed.A foregoneing of the Air France of Sabena's participation, which the French a total of 4 billion BFR.cost, would probably make it easier to get started as a “marriage to three”, which would currently require a widespread reduction of the Belgian state share of 62 %.

Tank truck, the Ferienjet, the wing / / Kloten-fright and delay for 141 passengers in Kloten: Your Balair / CTA holiday jet was rammed by a tank truck and the left wing was trimmed.
Million damage to flight and vehicle!A fully loaded tank truck hit the left wing of an MD-81 of the Balair / CTA, which was available on the apron.The tip of the wing was crumpled and the driver's cab of the tanker was smashed.
Due to the force of the impact, the two-beamed machine was shifted to the side so that an angular catering vehicle drilled a fist-sized hole in the aircraft fuselage.Airport spokesman Andreas Meier: «Fortunately, the passengers were not yet on board.And: Aircraft and tank truck were damaged so that no kerosene has leaked.»

Daily discussion on the ring / / ti.After a sideways movement several months, the Swissair's name shares set up a climb in the first days of August (see graphic).Based on a level of CHF 750, the course scored in the case of clearly attractive volumes up to CHF 852 and, after a minor correction, was one of the most important buyers, according to dealers.
The strongest thrust for the Swissair papers assumed the latest data on traffic development.While transport demand (in tons of kilometers) increased by 12 % in June, the supply only rose by 1.2 %, which was increased in a level of 70.6 % in a 6.8 percentage point compared to the same month.Especially on the highly competitive routes over the North and South Atlantic, the number of passengers is said to have increased significantly after stagnation in the previous months.
The promising prospects prompted a number of banks - most recently the bank company - to revise its profit estimates for the Swiss airline and recommend the Swissair titles for purchase.In earlier months, the papers, which are considered to be “cyclical”, who are racing quickly to economic signals, had not been able to keep up with the shares of other European companies.In addition to the visible traffic revival, the Swissair valors also benefited from the fact that the airport taxes previously contained in the flight ticket have been collected separately since June.
Because the companies - in the knowledge of the demand for demand - unchanged their tariffs, Swissair and Crossair enjoyed a "hidden" price increase of an average of 1 %.In 1995, the Swissair is likely to flow into additional yields of CHF 30 to CHF 30 to CHF 30 to CHF 30 to 50 million.Finally, the Swissair's interest in the Sabena and the associated potential access to the European internal market also attracted speculatively oriented investors from the reserve, whereby a number of votes assessed a commitment to the Sabena, which was sometimes smiled at as a "money destruction machine" as adventurous.

Glim obligation in Kloten / / Pi.A fully loaded tank truck rammed the wing of an aircraft on Thursday morning at Zurich Kloten Airport.
The MD-81 of the Balair / CTA was shifted by the impact on the roller field and crashed into a catering vehicle.As the airport directorate announced, nobody was injured, but damage was caused in the millions.According to the cantonal police, a 54 -year -old chauffeur drove his tanker truck parallel to the marked roller train at 7:40.
The handlebar was distracted by an oncoming vehicle and overlooked the left wing of the MD-81 of the Balair / CTA, in which part of the crew was located.The driver's cabin of the tank vehicle crashed into the tip of the wing and smashed it over a length of one meter.The aircraft was shifted to the side by the force of the impact.
In turn, it collided with a catering vehicle that was ready, which tore a hole in the fuselage of the rear left aircraft side.At the time of the accident, the cockpit crew and part of the cabin staff were on board the aircraft.Nobody got hurt .
The 141 passengers waiting in the departure hall were flown to Heraklion, Greece, with a replacement machine and around one -hour delay.As the press spokeswoman for the airport directorate, Sonja Zöchling, announced, the accident has expired lightly.The aircraft's fuel tanks were not damaged.
If the machine's wing tank is damaged, several thousand liter of kerosene would have expired and would have caused great pollution.The aircraft tanks hold a maximum of 22,000 liters of fuel.In the most extreme case, the chain reaction of accidents could have caused an explosion if the collision had occurred during a hot summer day (and not on the cool Thursday morning) and the tank truck would have been harmed.
The plane will be repaired in the next few days.The repair is extremely difficult and expensive because the flight structure is influenced by the condition of the outside wall.Property damage occurred in the millions.

Swissair and Crossair International on Aufwind / / Bern - More traffic in Swiss air: Last winter (November 1993 to April 1994), Swiss airports operated 6 percent more passengers and handled 13 percent more goods.
Swissair and Crossair have a 3 percent market share in passenger and 6 percent in freight traffic.They transported 51 percent of people and 66 percent of the freight goods.The course of the Swissair shares rose in August by over 100 to CHF 853.

New optimism of airlines / / SNA.After last year's “air hole”, when the growth of international air traffic was left behind the expectations of the airlines, they will again be a little more optimistic for the current year.
According to a survey by the American investment bank Salomon Brothers, among 20 non -Merican airlines, which together cover around 60 % of the world market, the current growth of traffic volume is estimated to be around 8.6 %.In the future, surveyed air companies also expect an average growth rate of around 6.9%. The overcapacity in international air traffic that has existed for a long time should only be easily reduced, since the big aircraft orders of the past years were still more optimistic.Complete dismantling of global overcapacity is not expected before 1996 or 1997.
While a majority of the requested companies meet this situation with measures to reduce costs or increasing the productivity, others try to get their overcapacity with technical means, such as the cancellation of aircraft orders or the removal of aircraft.As far as fleet planning is concerned, the 20 airlines expressed very precise ideas.The choice of an aircraft type is primarily based on the operating costs.
Only in second response are the demands of the market, aspects of fleet harmonization, the financing mode or the acquisition price.According to the survey, the previously popular concept of “family fleets” has finally had its day.Since no manufacturer can now respond to all the needs of an airline, this policy no longer makes any sense today.

Finale for the Hunter in Buochs / / Met.On the last weekend in August (Friday, Friday, August 26th and Saturday, August 27), the command of the aviation and aviation defense troops carried out a large air show with a considerable international participation, the “Air 94”.
The choice fell onto the Nidwaldner Fliegerhorst after being carried out against an implementation on the airfield Emmen of local resistance.However, Buochs is by no means a second choice for the organizers;The space at the western end of the Gersau basin is extremely attractive, the traffic conditions are cheap, and the safety aspect can also be taken into account optimally.
The reason for the two flight days is two anniversaries.The Swiss Air Force is 80 years old and the Hunter-Kunstflugfeffel Patrouille Suisse celebrates its 30th anniversary.The two appearances of the Swiss aerobatics relay - the flight program is practically identical on the two days - can also be counted among the highlights of the event.
At the end of the year it is important to say goodbye to the Hunter.The aging bombers are therefore not only demonstrated by the patrol Suisse pilots, but they will pass Buochs in a formation of 36 aircraft (!) And then also parked on the field.The “Air 94” will also offer good opportunities to compare with jet art flight relays from other armies.
Their participation of the patrol de France, the "Red Arrows" (Great Britain), the "Patrulla Aguila" (Spain) and the "FRECCE TRICOLORI" (Italy).The PC 7 team and the Venom / Vampire team can be seen on other formations.The cross-section through the flight material of the Swiss aircraft-including F / A-18 «Hornet»-is complete, plus demonstrations of numerous veterans, such as the Dowoitine D-26, the ME-108 and the ME-109, the «Fieseler Storch», the Mustang P-51 and the C-3603.The static exhibition, in which large space transport aircraft of the types of "Hercules" and "Transall" as well as the fighter planes F-14, F-14, "Tornado" and SU-22 are also shown on both days from 7 a.m.The flight demonstrations last from 8 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The Breitling World Cup of the International Aviation Association (FAI) is integrated into the “Air 94”.With propeller planes, the pilots show a freely compiled acrobatic program with musical accompaniment and traces of smoke.Admission to the “Air 94” is free.
Since a rush of tens of thousands of visitors will be expected on Saturday, the Nidwalden cantonal police recommend visiting the event on Friday and planning the journey by public transport;Bus shuttles run from the area train stations to the airfield.This also applies to the signaled parking spaces;

This is how you come to the flight show / / Buochs NW - to the «Air94», the largest Swiss flight show this year with over 200 aircraft in the air and on the ground, 100,000 spectators are expected at the military airfield in Buochs on Friday and Saturday.Entry is free - the traffic chaos programmed!
The police urgently advise to use the trains of the SBB, Lucerne-Stins-Engelberg-Bahn and Brünig-Bahn.From Stansstad, Stans, Hergiswil and Flüelen, extra buses drive directly to the airfield.Stansstad can also be reached by ship from Lucerne.

From heartache: pilot raced in Berg / / Rabat (Morocco) - "I want to die, die ..."
Pilot Younes Khayati (32) tears the joystick down.Seconds later, the aircraft is smashing on the mountain.44 people are dead - because the pilot had lovesickness!
The ATR-42 machine was on the flight from Agadir to Casablanca last Sunday when she crashed in the Atlas Mountains (Blick reported). Now the evaluation showed that the crash was caused by the pilot's suicide: "The reasons for this crazy act are only to be found in the emotional life of the pilot, »said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport in Rabat yesterday.Royal Air Maroc, owner of the accident machine, describes the love -sick Younes Khayati as an experienced pilot with 4,500 flight hours.The man's intention to suicide was "unpredictable".
The last words that have come in the cockpit are recorded on the flight writer.A protocol of horror: Copilotin Sofia Figuigui observes how the captain turns on the autopilot.
" What are you doing ?»Asks her in astonishment and horrified.Khayati: "Die, die ..." He tears the joystick down.
You: "Help, help, the commander has ..." Seconds later, the impact and the explosion of the aircraft can be heard.The pilot has reached its goal - and 43 people tore them into their deaths.Pilot Younes Khayati:

Sweden / / Cooperation of the SAS with Air Latvia.Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) has submitted the Latvian government to a proposal for the establishment of a new national airline in cooperation with Baltic International USA (BIUSA).
The Latvian state should hold 51 % of the shares, SAS and BIUSA each 18 %;The remaining stocks are to be drawn by institutional investors from Sweden.The company still to be founded is expected to start operating with 4 DC -9 - 21 of the SAS in November and employ around 200 employees.
The SAS emphasizes that the project was made possible by the financial commitments of the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.The start investment was $ 26 million.Latavio Latvian Airlines, which is 100 % in state property, are later to be taken over by international traffic rights (in addition to the routes Riga-Hamburg, Riga-London and Riga-Frank Furt).

Reduced loss of semester of Swissair / / GT.The Swissair Group presents consolidated semester for the first time and, as is stated in the corresponding communiqué, can look back on a positive development for the first half of 1994 in that the designated net loss compared to the 1993 comparison period could be reduced by a good 26 %.
However, the remaining minus of CHF 48 million in the net result (see box) is the fact that the operational activities in the reporting time could be brought into the profit zone with a result of an improved result by CHF 11 million.Above all, the expectations of high traffic growth and the cost reduction measures, which are successfully enforced, contributed to this;In this context, the communiqué emphasizes that the net result would have exceeded the profit threshold in the first half of the year without the strongly negative currency influences.
Increased currency in -depth negative negative had the weakness of important foreign currencies over Swiss Franconia, which reduced the income by over 100 million CHF and operational success by over 50 million CHF.As a result of the still missing air traffic agreement between Switzerland and the European Union, the airlines of the Swissair group are still more difficult to position in Europe.Swissair expects a further traffic to be resolved for the traditionally less profit -making second half of the year;
However, there is still no clear trend reversal for the average income.Overall, the Swissair is confident that the current year with a group result, which is significantly improved compared to 1993.The Swissair Group's net annual profit decreased to CHF 59 million in 1993 after he was CHF 113 million and CHF 83 million in the two previous years.
High aircraft capacity utilization of the Swissair airline, the transport performance sold was increased by 10.3 (9.5) to 1528.3 million tons of kilometers and the total load of the aircraft by 3.8 percentage points to 66.3 %.Above average growth rates recorded the traffic areas of Africa and the far east as well as the freight, in which the used toning kilometers increased by 18.1 %.However, the positive demand development, which even decreased by 1 %, was not able to follow, primarily because they were severely impaired by currency influences, tariff erosion and traffic composition;
Nevertheless, the Swissair airline also completed with a slightly improved semester result.As a result of the margins suppressed at Balair / CTA, the earnings (+7 %) did not take the demand (+23 %);Thanks to only a weak cost increase, the semester result could still be easily improved.
The CrossAir generated an as good result as in the previous year;Supply and demand increased by 13 % each, costs and income by 7 % each.Swissair Beteiligungen AG achieved a significant improvement in results, which, according to the Communiqué, should continue in the second half of the year.

Lex Friedrich also applies to Swiss / / RMA./ROM.Bern, 3rd October question and explorer.
As usual, the first agenda of the second week of session (starting session: 2:30 p.m.) is the question time.Financial Department of Altenrhein will no longer be handed over to German, Belgian and Danish private pilots because their countries do not keep a counterwit, the President of the Federal President Stein on a question from Steinemann (FPS., St. Gallen).- The Federal Council will provide information about its savings efforts on October 19 (question Steinemann).
- There is by no means an embargo with regard to the VAT execution papers;A single brochure of the cantons was not produced because it had only provisional character (questioner, SVP., Aargau).- The introduction of VAT naturally causes difficulties;
The administration makes great efforts to inform those affected and, for example, issue industry brochures (question Hegetschweiler, FDP., Zurich).- The retention of the retention of must only in the case of very high yields and thus causes a negative balance for a small minority of farmers (Frageruckstuhl, CVP., St. Gallen). Transport and energy management department with the programs S Plus and Switzerland 4 is offered a chanceto survive a challenge, Federal Councilor Ogi notes the Reimann questioner (SVP., Aargau).
The Federal Council regrets the layoffs at S Plus, but cannot and does not want to comment on personnel issues.The qualities of the Switzerland 4 director Dario Robbiani are generally recognized.- The EVED will soon decide whether a charter company can be granted the concession for flights between Geneva and Zurich;
Already to answer the basic questions asked here was to be prejudiced this decision.(Question Gros, Leb., Geneva).
The Federal Council does not consider the risks of the fast breeder in Creys-Malville to be above average and therefore does not want to join a legal proceedings against the French authorities.Repeated contacts with French ministers convinced us of the seriousness of the specialists used.However, the Federal Council has an understanding of often unfounded fears among the population (Fabienne Bugnon, Gp., Geneva, and Francine Jeanprêtre, Sp., Vaud).
- There are already strict pan-European regulations for the transports of inflammable and explodable goods (question Bishop, Sd.-Lega., Zurich).- With regard to the storage and reprocessing of fuel elements from the Gösgen nuclear power plant in Krasnojarsk, an informal conversation took place on the request of the Russian side, an export application is not yet available (Fragerosmarie Bär, Gp., Bern).- Heavy traffic has actually increased massively on the Cham-Birmensdorf axis in recent years.
The general lines of the N 4 there can only be determined if the Federal Supreme Court has decided on pending complaints.The execution will inevitably be delayed in view of the tight finances (questionnaire, FDP., Zurich).- It is not true that only German was spoken at a conference of the Federal Office for Energy Service last August (questioning, CVP., Bern). Federal chancellor's “huge difficulties”, which are, among other things, caused by a lack of personnel, the Federal Chancellery is doing everything toSystematic collection of federal law to deliver as quickly as possible.
This is the answer of Federal Chancellor Couchepin to a question from Dettling (FDP., Schwyz). Department of Foreign Affairs Endie Switzerland is aware that their development aid is also to countries that are at risk from corruption, confirms Federal Councilor Cotti to Steinemann (FPS.,,, FPS.,St. Gallen ) .However, the population led the help of the help of the help;
It makes more sense to promote the rule of law and transparency in the partner countries.- In Bosnia-Herzegovina, Switzerland focuses on the support of the organizations active in the place.Since the start of the fight, around CHF 24 million, the IKRK, has reached CHF 16 million, and recently we have transferred 0.5 million francs for designation (question Engler, CVP, Appenzell Innerrhoden).
- There is actually no rental agreement for the new UNHCR building in Geneva.This corresponds to the current practice, which will be changed in the future that a preliminary contract will be concluded (question Moser, FPS., Aargau).to protest (questionnaires, fps., Zurich).- The Federal Council advocates an in -depth discussion in the general public about the UN - next year as part of the 50th anniversary - and will soon present a corresponding rough concept (question cross, sp., Zurich).
- Switzerland will participate in the construction program in Haiti via a balance of payments.It is also ready to provide expert aid to the creation of a civil gendarmerie as part of an international campaign (questionpia Hollenstein, Gp., St. Gallen).- The Swiss authorities pursue the trial against six detained Kurdish parliamentarians in Ankara;
When solving the Kurdish question, only the path of the dialogue (question Zisyadis, PDA., Geneva).Lega.There are therefore no restrictions on trips to India;
For travelers from India, a dispositive has been built in the airports, which, among other things, provides quarantine for up to six days.Switzerland has not imported 500, but 117 kilograms of heroin for their program in a medically controlled drug tax.In fact, the pro test person is almost twice as high doses as in England.
And the import requirement will increase with the expansion of the program (question Pidoux, FDP., Vaud).- The legal import of heroin for the program mentioned cannot be put to the same level as the offense of the Dutch recently executed in Singapore.Its offenses would also have been punished strictly in Switzerland (question Kern, Fps., Zurich).
- The BUWAL's sensitization campaign is aimed at youth throughout Switzerland;The annual costs of CHF 1.8 million are justifiable.The federal government is only active (questionneviève aubry, fdp.
, Bern).- The claim that homeopathic treatments would not be taken into account in the KVG in the complementary medical services is wrong.Work on the KVG regulation only begins after the referendum (question Jöri, CVP., Lucerne).
The EJPD, the EMD, the EVD (13) questions are answered in writing.Unemployment insurance.After the question time, the National Council continues the detailed advice of the partial revision of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
- Fasel (CVP., Freiburg) requested that the control regulations for bad weather compensation are added: The cantonal office can order further checks to avoid abuse in individual cases.This corresponds to the additional cantonal control of short -time work.In agreement with the Commission and the Federal Council, the addition is tacitly approved.
The sixth chapter deals with benefits for labor market measures to prevent and combat unemployment.With a reduction in commission, Ursula Hafner (Sp., Schaffhausen) wants to fix an actual claim by the unemployed on retraining, further education or integration courses that improve their ability to mediate.Christine Goll (Sp., Zurich) supports this application, because this is the only way to actually motivate the unemployed for these forced measures.
The commission officers reject the expression of compulsory measures, because the retraining is a consideration for the purchase of day money.A legal right to a promising course program cannot be granted, because the would be too far.Federal Councilor Delamuraz agrees at:
It is not important that the unemployed can insist on completing a certain course instead of accepting an employment offered to him.With 91 to 46 votes, the plenary follows the majority.Applications for the Financing Bonny (FDP., Bern) presents three applications for the financing of labor market measures, which, according to the majority proposal, have significant financial effects on the cantons.
According to Bonny, 95 percent should be at the expense of the cash register and 5 percent at the expense of the cantons during training and employment programs.This would involve a net pollution of CHF 100 million for the cantons (minus 115 million in employment programs, plus 15 million in training).The cash registers.
We are already going far towards the cantons.It takes a minimum of 10 percent, so that the cantons are interested in doing the employment programs inexpensively.Federal Council Delamuraz believes that the financial burden of the federal and cantons through the revision template would have to be considered as a whole.
Bonny's applications clearly have their justification, as the commission proposals do not provide for a cantonal participation in the training measures.This would also meet the wishes of the cantons after a measurement of the loads that arise.With 104 to 44 votes, the plenum follows the applications Bonny.
Internships at PTT and SBBComby (FDP., Valais) would then like to make a contribution to combating unemployment from the control companies PTT and SBB by creating a total of 3000 permanent internships for young people for six months.Commission officers and Federal Council attest to the applicant good will, but this proposal has no place in this law.It is also not a matter of demanding entrepreneurial action from the company and at the same time tying new requirements.
Comby withdraws his application with confidence that the Federal Council will bring in the concerns of the company.Since Federal Councilor Delamuraz is claimed in the Council of States, the National Council interrupts unemployment insurance.Financial Control Act. The reason for a written report by the Finance Commission is tacitly concluding the Council of States in the final differences in the Financial Control Act.
Direct federal taxpayer David (CVP., St. Gallen) and Couchepin (FDP., Valais) then report on the proposal of the unification conference on the painful history of the tax recording of capital income from the deposit of a single bonus.These should be tax -free if the policyholder is 60 years or older and the contract took at least five years.The precautionary thought has thus been taken into account.
The plenary also follows this application without further discussion.Lex Friedrichebenfahrfahrt Differen is then concerned with the relaxation of the Lex Friedrich regarding the acquisition of land abroad.
The commission officers Herczog (Sp., Zurich) and comby (FDP., Valais) request that the majority of the preparatory committee, in contrast to the Council of States and the Federal Council, apply to the privilege of the Swiss abroad.On the name of a reduction in commission, Engler (CVP., Appenzell Innerrhoden) recommends approval to the clear state council.Anyone who believes that the little chamber will be steered wrong.
An unification conference would lead to a delay in the business.The version of the National Council violates various settlement contracts with abroad.Vetterli (SVP., Zurich) pleads for capture, because with the privilege of the Swiss abroad, the foreigners are not further disadvantaged.
It is only a small gesture compared to the otherwise highly praised fifth Switzerland.Trix Heberlein (FDP., Zurich) also believes that it was completely exaggerated to highlight the privilege of the Swiss abroad as an alleged discrimination against international law.Ducret (CVP., Geneva) agreed with:
After all, all Swiss are the same before the law.It would be shocking if a Swiss abroad who coordinates and chooses cannot buy a property in his home country.However, the votant recommends abstention in order not to further delay the adoption of the template.
Only a provisional poncet (lib., Geneva) sees the discussion further proof that the Lex Friedrich should be abolished without replacement.Since the present revision is only an intermediate step to this end goal, the further privilege of the Swiss abroad is justifiable during this transition period.Borradori and Maspoli (Sd.-Lega., Ticino) are also committed to the preferred treatment of the Swiss abroad for moral reasons.
BUNDI (sp., Graubünden) is reminiscent of the guidelines of the revision: transition from the nationality to the locality principle.Therefore, there can be no special solution for the Swiss abroad, because finally the law affects people abroad and not foreigners.
A holding on can give us unimagined difficulties, which primarily suffer from Switzerland abroad.Verena Grendelmeier (Ldu.-Evp., Zurich) in turn agrees to the majority, because it is a provisional.In this transition phase, it is politically and psychologically wise to treat the much -sung fifth Switzerland somewhat privileged.
Federal Councilor Koller has a psychological understanding of those who want to adhere to the privilege of the Swiss abroad.However, the fact that the Swiss abroad also have to search for a granting for a property acquisition at home is an indispensable consequence of the transition from the nationality to the principle of living.In particular, the Swiss abroad would have to suffer from probable retoring measures.
With the maintenance of the difference, the applicable Lex Friedrich would remain next year.On the basis of these prospects, the plenary follows the minority and the Federal Council with 78 to 67 votes and, analogous to the Council of States, refrained from privilege of the Swiss abroad.The template is definitely adjusted.
Total revision of the Federal Constitutional National Council then deals with a state motion motion and an interpellation of the SP parliamentary group regarding the total revision of the Federal Constitution.As the speakers Ruckstuhl (CVP., St. Gallen) and Geneviève Aubry (FDP., Bern) report, the State Political Commission unanimously approved the motion of the Lucerne Councilor Josi Meier, who sets a fixed date for the total revision.A corresponding template in the Federal Assembly is to be adopted at the 150th anniversary of the state in 1998.
With this schedule, the total revision, which has been roasting like a tough one for years, can be heated up again.Distrust of overhaul of the constitution is unmistakable among the people.However, if after 135 revisions we have approached the total revision in the spirit of the preamble since 1874, the project would have to succeed.
Bundi (Sp., Graubünden) welcomes the Federal Council's intention to present a draft with variants in 1995.It is also positive that, in addition to the linguistic adjustment and systematization of the applicable constitutional text, he also wants to put up to discuss content -related reforms.However, we would have liked more precise information about the guidelines of the total revision.
Fritschi (Fdp., Zurich) As the first group spokesman emphasizes that the only time to eat is new to the Städätstal advance.This puts less pressure on the Federal Council than Parliament.We advocate this self -confidence, but it has to be made clear that the total revision will not become a broadband antibiotic that can eliminate all existing evil.
A successful revision project will not remove the difficulty of everyday policy.We see the heavyweight of the innovations in the institutional area: in the reform of political rights and in the government and parliamentary reform.Schmied (SVP., Bern) sees no more reason after clarification of the EEA question for another waiting for a template for the total revision of the Federal Constitution.
However, we place greater weight on a majority -capable draft than on a specific date.That's why we don't want to bind our hands with the motion.Here the Council interrupts the total revision debate and returns again for the detailed advice of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
Unemployment insurance in Article 72a is about the insured person's claim to temporary employment.If the canton is not able to grant such an employment, the unemployed is entitled to 80 special daily money.Cavadini (FDP., Ticino) requests that the cantons only have to cover 15 instead of 25 percent of these costs.
Maitre (CVP., Geneva) recommends not to set a cantonal component at all.It is unacceptable to pull through the revision of unemployment insurance on the cantons' hump.The cantons' dugout to finance tag funds is also unconstitutional.
The canton of Geneva alone would cost around CHF 50 million.In any case, the Votant proposes to reduce the cantonal share to 10 percent in exceptional cases.Zisyadis (PDA.
, Vaud) also requests the deletion of every cantonal participation.In concrete terms, this means that the more a canton is affected by unemployment, the stronger it is punished financially.
That is the beginning of complete disposal.If a canton cannot offer employment, it is not due to a lack of good will, but because there is already great unemployment.The heart of the front
Commission speakers admit that you are here with a heart of the template.After all, the cantons have already been relieved of CHF 100 million by the applications by balance.Originally, the commission spoke of a 60 percent participation in order to stare at the cantons to take the humanity possible to employ the unemployed.
This persistent proposal did not find a majority, but a gentle financial coercion should be maintained.It is not about a load shift at the expense of the cantons.With this steering instrument, we just want to prevent the cantons from choosing the simpler path of the day allowance payment and thus straining the insurance.
Federal Councilor Delamuraz qualifies the commission proposal as balanced.However, one could live with the eventual application Maitre, because this could reduce the 25 percent participation of the cantons in exceptional cases, specifically for a financial weak canton, which is particularly hard affected by unemployment, to 10 percent.In the following votes, the application Cavadini will be rejected with 105 to 47 votes and the deletion application Maitre / Zisyadis with 116 to 37 votes.
However, the eventual application Maitre is approved in accordance with the Federal Council with 114 to 40 votes.Cantons and employment program connections are about the cost sharing of the cantons on the employment programs.For economic steering reasons, the commission officers consider such participation to be essential so that the programs are carried out efficiently and economically.
The Commission proposes a 10 percent participation, Bonny wants to limit itself to 5 percent.It attaches importance to the fact that the same approach is chosen for retraining measures and employment programs so that an instrument is not preferred for financial reasons.Federal Councilor Delamuraz agrees with:
The benefits of the cash register and cantons should be determined everywhere (95 or 5 percent).With 92 to 30 votes, the plenary follows this argument and follows Bonny's application.Loeb (FDP., Bern) would also like to enable private individuals at the regional employment centers.
The cantons would be free to transfer certain tasks private.The application runs open doors for the commission officers, because the cantonal offices can also work with private job brokers.Loeb replicates that he is not only concerned with job placement, but about additional tasks such as career counseling, etc., which his application is approved with 56 to 47 votes.

View of the model building in the Verkehrshaus Lucerne / / MJM.Lucerne, at the beginning of October of October of the successful and ambitious China exhibition and after the 25th anniversary of the Planetarium, the Verkehrshaus Lucerne is changing back on well-known paths with the latest special exhibition: From October 8 to 16, a large model building exhibition will take place, which is carried out for the third time in this form and has almost become a tradition.
At the center of the “Fascination Model 94” are models of aircraft, cars and ships, but, as director Fredy Rey emphasized at a press conference, no models of railways.The tradition of the model building exhibitions now also includes that the railway models are only the focus every two years.“Railway model construction days” are therefore again planned for 1995.
What does the traffic house have to offer?First of all, there are a variety of aircraft, car and ship models, namely large 1:10 scale models, numerous models on a smaller scale and a few models in the 1: 1250 (from Heinz-Peter Weiss, Bochum).Nobody knew the exact number - hundreds of models to be seen - nobody knew to say at the press conference.
In addition, there are entire model systems such as a port model from Rotterdam in the courtyard of the traffic center, where Dutch model makers replay the operating processes of a raised port.It is also worth noting that the originals are shown in addition to the models, such as a Russian Lasthelicopter Mi-2.According to the Rey, the focus this year focuses on the helicopters.
On weekends, the Rega Aussenstation first field is also represented with an Alouette III.The fact that visitors can get advice from various model building experts, especially the model maker of the traffic center, Hans Hüppi, gives the exhibition a practical grade.Finally, young people are given the opportunity to build a glider pilot, a kite, a rocket or a helicopter under guidance.

Commitment to the “Airport 2000” / / -I in the coming summer will be voted on in the canton of Zurich via the “Airport 2000” project.
Should Kloten Airport be expanded or not?At an information event at the invitation of the “Cosmopolitan Zurich” committee, three supporters of the template, namely FDP national councilor Vreni Spoerry, canton planner Christian Gabathuler and Paul Reutlinger, President of the Swiss Transport Center.If the project finds the approval of the cantonal council and the people, according to Vreni Spoerry you will start building in four years.
The facility, which is primarily intended to improve ground traffic, would open at the beginning of the next century.So that the lively air traffic for residents does not become an unbearable burden, the modernization of the infrastructure in Kloten should go hand in hand with a qualitative improvement in environmental protection.As the head of the Swissair marketing director, Paul Reutlinger knows the dossier airport very well:
Punctuality at Kloten Airport is one of the worst in Europe.It is to be improved with the “Airport 2000” project.According to canton planner Christian Gabathuler, Zurich has a center function, and in his opinion this includes an internationally competitive airport.

Leaving at the flight sky / / SX.The International Air Transport Association IATA, to which 222 airlines belong, in 1993 in international line traffic, a further $ 4.1 billion in loss.
The airlines, which meet on Monday for the 50th annual meeting of the IATA in Mexico City, show a high deficit for the fourth time in a row.From 1990 to 1993, the IATA airlines in international line traffic lost a total of $ 15.6 billion than they have earned in all the years.IATA General Secretary Pierre Jeanniot in 1994 indicates a turn to the better:
For the current year, for the first time since 1989, a modest profit of about $ 1 billion is expected.This pale dawn on the horizon gives the anniversary meeting a welcome Rosaton.The industry is of course aware that this profit, which is less than 1 % of sales, must increase to 5 - 6 sales percentages so that the already financial airlines can run their operation from a solid basis.
The motto of the IATA general secretary in Mexico City is also succinct: «Make Profits!“Missing the airlines the return to profitability, according to Jeanniot, they will either disappear as international sea shipping for passengers, or they become the game ball of political subsidies such as the railways.How great the financial crater became at the airlines from 1990 to 1993 can be seen from a number:
Instead of the necessary profits of about $ 20 billion, the airlines suffered a loss of $ 15.6 billion.The aerospace industry is therefore lacking the sum of almost $ 36 billion. The demand in international line traffic rose by 6.4 % in the passengers in 1993, while it decreased by 0.8 % in domestic traffic.
Charter traffic suffered again.The capacity was reduced by 10 % in international traffic, and the number of passenger kilometers flown decreased by 4.1 %.The main reason for the cancer in charter traffic is the hard price struggles in regular traffic, which also attract holiday travelers.
At the freight, the airlines recorded a total of 7.3 % in 1993, and even 9.3 % in international traffic.The charging factor for freight and passengers increased by 1.4 % to 61.3 % in international line traffic.However, since on average the cost reductions in the airlines were less than the earnings erosions failed, the load factor required for Break even increased to 61.5%
IATA predicts annual growth of 6.6 % for the years 1994 - 98 in international passenger traffic.Western Europe with 5.6 % and North America with 4.7 %, in the IATA's view, develop rather below average, while growth above the means is expected for Eastern and Central Europe (+8.6 %) and Asia (+9 %).In air freight traffic, the IATA assumes an average annual growth of 9 %.
The distribution of growth is also different here: The growth rates for Asia are almost twice as high at 12 % annually as that for Western Europe.The World Affords Association IATA will also deal with its own structures at its annual meeting.

In the case of the Kansai International Airport at Osaka in Japan in Japan, the SAS's return to the core business / / privilege was reserved for the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).Jan Stenberg, President of the Scandinavian airline since April this year, was also on board the Boeing 767 - 300.
As a former Executive Vice President of the Swedish Telecom Group Ericsson and consequently, the Swede Jan Stenberg knows the customer needs that are decisive for the success of an airline.The SAS also urgently needs to get back into a climbing flight.The airline in Jan Carlzon's person has a visionary leadership for a long time, but the global recession has also shaken the Scandinavian airline at the European periphery.
The failure of “Alcázar” in December 1993 not only led to Carlzon's departure, but also to disillusionment.The subsequent interregnum of Norwegian Jan Reinås as Chief Executive Officer was unable to make any major changes, and Jan Stenberg also first needed the usual “training period”.Now, after the half -year figures became known for 1994 and some declarations of intent, the first indications arise as to which goals SAS head for with her chief pilot.
Again in the profit zone, it is certainly the fact that the company has succeeded in a profit of 617 million SKR last year's half -year loss of 609 million Swedish crowns (Skr.).to convert after depreciation and before taxes.Due to the positive figures, the financial situation of the SAS group has improved overall.
The high net debt is reduced by 3.94 billion SKR.at 9.95 billion SKR., and the equity ratio has increased to 23 percent.
Various factors have contributed to this result improvement.In addition to an internal cost reduction program, the higher price of the Swedish crown and better achievements in the operational area, it is above all the return to the core business.This change has been carried out with the sale of various SAS participations and subsidiaries.
In February 1994, the participation in Lanchile was sold.As of May 31, 1994, SAS Leisure, who worked in the travel sector, was assigned to Airtours PLC in Great Britain, with which a consolidated capital gain of 374 million SKR.could be achieved.The catering company SAS Service Partner was ceded to Gate Gourmet and the participation in Diners Club Nordic of the Swedish Scandinaviska Enskilda banks.
However, the latter two posts will only be reflected in the annual report of the second half of the 1994.This new strategy clearly differs from Carlzon's vision of a global traffic and service system based on cooperation, which should have been available to travelers anywhere as possible in the world.Jan Stenberg admits that his predecessor had just taken over with some participations - for example in the Inter -Continental Hotels - but it was finally unpredictable factors that made this global traffic system failed.
Stenberg, for example, means that the state and subsequent subsidy subsidies that receive certain European airlines to survive.Maintenance period is related to the Swissair or with the European Quality Alliance (EQA), the Swede has a six -month maternity period that expires these days;
Accordingly, new announcements can be expected in the next few weeks in relation to the further existence of the EQA.However, according to Stenberg, the need for close cooperation - in particular with an exchange of capital - has seemed to have become lower again, according to Stenberg.Nevertheless, SAS announced at the beginning of September to found a new airline together with the Latvian government as a majority shareholder and with Baltic International Airlines, which is to serve destinations in North and Eastern Europe from the Latvian capital from spring 1995.
This intention may indicate the course of the Scandinavian carrier in the civilian air traffic of tomorrow: to build a large number of flight connections in a geographically defined catchment area and only in a second step, provided that there is also a demand in the corresponding home market, to offer few, selected long -distance courses.Such a strategy also corresponds to SAS's fleet planning.After a consolidation phase, the company intends to buy a new short and medium-haul fleet before the end of this decade.
The SAS aircraft park from 13 Boeing 767-300, 9 DC-9-21, 26 DC-9-41, 30 MD-81, 9 MD-82, 1 MD-83, 16 MD-87, 6 Boeing737 - 500, 2 Boeing 737 - 300 QC, 19 Fokker F -28 and 22 Fokker 50 together
.2 Boeing 767 - 200, 6 MD -90 and 2 Boeing 737 - 500. Expansions in the Hotelekordas SAS route network today comprise 102 destinations in 34 countries.Measured on the market share and passenger volume, SAS is the fourth largest airline in Europe.
It offers around 1000 connections every day and transports 18 million passengers annually and 200,000 tons of freight.The average utilization of the cabins is currently 63 percent.The company employs around 23,500 people worldwide.
A cost reduction program, which also provides for the discharge of a further 2900 employees, is expected to save 3 billion SKR by the end of June 1995.to generate .In addition to the airline, the SAS group also includes SAS Trading, a trading company that operates its own shops to airports and supplies others.
The SAS International Hotels (SIH) are considered a subsidiary and are mostly represented in Europe with 33 hotels.The recently announced Allianz with the Radisson Hotels International (Carlson Companies, Minneapolis) transmits franchising rights for all existing and future Radisson houses in Europe.This clear structure of the SAS Group, which is limited by targeted selling, is unequivocally wearing the handwriting of Stenberg.
He doesn't think much of Prestigekenken.Services in the operational area that are not directly related to the customer should, according to Stenberg, be carried out by third -party companies;Only what is visible must wear the lettering sas.
The former frequent flyer also rejects the patronage of the business traveler with a variety of sometimes unnecessary service games before and after the flight.An airline should concentrate on flying, as there are already enough other providers for the other services.Also in terms of service on board, Stenberg sounds almost radical in his statements:

First Airbus A-321 for the Swissair soon fledts / / During these days, the first Airbus A-321 for Swissair will be assembled at the German Aerospace Airbus in Hamburg.
The first delivery will take place in January, until spring 1997, the renewal of the short and medium-haul fleet is to be completed.The Swiss carrier promises higher economy, less noise, cheaper exhaust gas values and maintenance and operating advantages due to the procurement of 29 of the same aircraft family.Hamburg, in the Octoberdas largest fleet renewal program in the history of Swissair, is before the start.
In the large assembly hall of the German Aerospace Airbus in Hamburg-Finkenwerder, the first Airbus A-321, still without chassis, are still without painting, only the side leaders already have the Swiss cross.A look into the interior of a modern transport aircraft has not yet been adjusted, the huge cable trees are open.In three months, this “construction site” will become a fledged jet, because in January 1995 the delivery date of the first aircraft of the new, 29 units is comprehensive Airbus European Carrier.
Swissair spends a total of CHF 2.35 billion in order to renew the short and medium-haul fleet (which remain in use) from 24 MD-81 and 5 Airbuses A-310- 200.By May 1997, 8 Airbus A-321, 16 A-320 and 5 A-319 were delivered to Zurich with a cadence of approximately one plane per month.In the Swissair version, the A-320 (first delivery of May 1995) will have 140 passenger places, the 7 meter longer A-321 of their 176, the "reduced by 3.7 meters"
A-319 (first delivery April 1996) still 109. Swissair hopes for more flexibility in operational planning from this fleet composition, but it will be possible to adapt the flight program of traveler and freight demand practically daily.On the other hand, the use of the same engine for all three versions (comparisons box) will reduce the maintenance effort.
Flexible interior interior interior will have to get used to the passenger that - popular with the audience - from the public,
When he no longer finds two two (business) or a two-person and a three-person seating series (Economy), but in both classes one more place per row.According to the customer, these new configuration, which is not only advantages, is made up for by the fact that the total cabin width is 19 cm more than in the comparable competitive patterns Boeing 737 and 757.In addition, Swissair does not fully draw the seat capacity of the aircraft, so that there is favorable conditions in terms of legroom.
The overhead luggage levies are significantly larger than with the MD-81.And the greatest possible flexibility is also the goal of seating by working with the manufacturer with the manufacturer on an easily sliding design of the interior.Board kitchens, toilets and cloakrooms should be able to be moved in terms of customs without much effort in order to be able to react quickly to changes in demand in the two classes.
Smaller conversions must even be made overnight.The almost identical interpretation of the cockpits of the A -319 - 320 - 321 family brings great advantages regarding the training and use of the crews.Anyone who is qualified for one of the three patterns is for all three.
The latest Airbus family brings major changes in flight management for the Swissair pilots by triggering electrical signals using so-called “Sidesticks”, which are processed by computers and are being conducted as commands to the control surfaces.The computer programs are designed in such a way that overloading the cell or critical flight spaces are made possible.However, a safe landing would also be ensured by the trim still functioning mechanically in the event of a total failure of the “Fly by Wire” system.
Of course, the procurement of aircraft from the A -320 family also contains interesting aspects for the Swissair - Austrian - Austrian partnership.All three companies - the Austrian Airlines have ordered seven A -320 and six A -321 - agree that units with the same technical specification should be obtained.This not only opens up interesting perspectives in terms of maintenance, but also allowed even the exchange of airplanes among the three carriers if necessary.
Over 800 orders for Airbus Industry is the total number of orders for the types A-319 / -320 / -321 The proof that it was right to enter the shop with aircraft short to medium range with fewer than 200 seats in 1984Market no longer left to the two American competitors, as was emphasized in Hamburg.So far, 821 fixed orders for the three patterns have been received, 478 of them (A-320, first flight in 1987, and A-321, first flight in 1993) have now been delivered to 50 airlines.

Realignment of the Aviation Policy of the USA / / The American Transport Minister Federico Pena has announced a realignment of air traffic policy.After that, according to the pattern of the “Open Skies” agreement with the Netherlands, agreements should be made, wherever this is possible and practical.
Initial negotiations are planned with nine smaller European countries, including Switzerland.In addition to the European internal market, the United States also have the United States in their sights in Asia and Latin America.CLS.
Washington, November 2nd part of a reorientation of US Air Traffic Policy and with the long-term goal of a global liberalized air traffic, the American Minister of Transport Federico Pena Rasche "Open Skies" negotiations with nine European countries, including Switzerland.Pena made his statements on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Chicago.The talks should begin within the next few weeks after the countries in question had explained their willingness to negotiate revealing air traffic agreements.
In addition to Switzerland, it is the three “SAS countries” Sweden, Norway and Denmark as well as Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Iceland and possibly Finland, which, however, initially distanced itself again.Catalyst effect for Switzerland and Swissair are at stake considerable interests, the Alliance could be expanded with Delta Airlines under an “Open Skies” regime and a significant traffic potential can be opened up via “Code Sharing”.Bern had already been presented in Washington in June last year with the desire to renew the restrictive bilateral aviation agreement.
At that time, however, the United States initially wanted to wait for Alcázar development.After the failure of Alcázar, things were delayed, and Washington was not very inclined until the end to drive with Switzerland on bilateral rail because there were no significant interests for the United States.Instead, Washington sought “open skies” agreements with more potent partners such as Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy to secure free access to the European community.
Since this has not succeeded, America now wants to pursue a strategy of the smaller steps.The intended agreements with the eight or nine smaller countries according to the pattern of the American-Dutch Agreement should serve as an example and catalyst.The United States hope that the other EC partners will occasionally jump on the train.
Pena invited all European countries and the European Union to go together to a free global air traffic.The administration of Clinton has doubts that globalization and liberalization of aviation will be an inevitable consequence of increasing demand and economic developments.From the American perspective, the countries that continue to be committed to protectionism will have to add a small way - and at a higher price.
According to the new strategy, the administration wants to use all opportunities for more freedom in air traffic.In doing so, she wants to act pragmatically, negotiate bilateral, trilateral or, according to the fact, multilaterally and make transitional solutions or agreements with hesitant partners, which initially only cover individual sectors.A multilateral framework contract is apparently sought with the eight (or nine) states in question, which would then have to be filled with details on a bilateral basis.
Strategy of the small steps of the USA are not only targeting the common market.A new attempt is also to be undertaken with Canada, where the aviation relationships are far behind the trade relationships.
With “highest priority”, partnerships and relationships with emerging countries in Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe are then to be built up.Pena asked the US airlines to actively search for a partner and to forge international alliances.With this pragmatic strategy of the small steps towards globalization of the aviation, the government does not necessarily meet the presentation of the leading US airlines, which demanded a multilateral “open skies” agreement among the most important countries.

Foreign companies / / Bonn, Nov. 10 Gy.Those responsible for the German Lufthansa continue to estimate the company's earnings situation and again promise that the current financial year should give shareholders a dividend again.
In the 3rd quarter of the current year, the airline increased the profit before taxes compared to the previous year's period by more than 50 % to DM 220 million, so that one expects a total of balance overall.Since only the 1st quarter of the financial year still causes losses, but the 2nd quarter of a year had already made a profit before DM 187 million, there was a total of a total of DM 325 million for the period of January to September.Compared to the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of DM 401 million, which, according to the company's information, was also fully developed in the operational business.
In some cases, the profit increase in the first 9 reporting months is due to a grown sales benefit: the traffic proceeds rose by 8.1 % to DM 10.6 billion, the total sales of 7.5 % to just under DM 12 billion.Expressed in "Naturals" (tons of kilometers), the services in the AG increased by 11.1 % compared to the previous year, in the group by 8.8 %.
The number of passengers in the AG increased by 2.8 % to 22 million people, in the group it rose by 4.7 % to 28.4 million people.The freight even expanded by 19.9 % to almost 910,000 t compared to the previous year.Since the range of services was expanded a little less than the demand, the payload factor in the AG rose by 1.7 points to 70.7 %, in the group the occupancy increased by 1.8 points to 70.4 %.
The earnings also benefited that the effort in the recent quarter grew underproportional to turnover, so that labor productivity is now 17 % above the current quartal.At the same time, the staff in the AG has decreased by 4.2 % to almost 45,000 employees.In the 3 quarters, the Finanz Cash Flow in the Group achieved DM 1.8 billion;
This amount faced DM 1.7 billion in investments.In addition, the AG flowed from the recent capital increase funds of DM 1.2 billion, which will help to ensure that the net debt debt should decrease by about 35 % below the previous year.The group management expects a balanced operational result for the fourth quarter of the financial year.
Veba group with more energy, Nov. 10 Gy.The mixed group of Düsseldorfer Veba AG clearly gained in earnings in the first 9 months of the current year.The almost 7%increase in sales compared to the previous year's period, together with changes in the group structure, led to a thrust on the profit level (see box), which had already emerged in the half -year report.
The surplus before yield taxes rose by 41.2 % compared to the previous year, according to taxes and parts of third parties, the progress of the surplus of the Group is 49.4 %.This takes into account extraordinary yields from the sale of parts of the company (DM 132 million) as well as expenses to the task of activities or to control the costs (over 250 million DM).In addition to the economic recovery, the measures taken on the cost side have also strengthened the profitability on the cost side.
Among other things, the recent time has apparently noticeably increased the efficiency at surgical levels, with special burdens from restructuring and declining causing a loss again in the current year.The earnings situation in the oil business was also classified as still unsatisfactory.However, profitable areas such as the energy -saving - which has a pure gain margin of around 7 % - have a significant impact on the earnings, especially since the electricity business has recently expanded against Scandinavia and East Germany.
Stagnating profit ID of the Royal Dutch / Shellbrussels, Nov. 10 PMR.The quarterly oil company Royal Dutch / Shell's quarterly oil company is difficult to interpret in the previous year and the stock assessment.On the basis of the respective crude oil prices, there was a slightly increasing surplus of 815 (i.V. 809) million in the 3rd quarter and a 4 % increased net profit of £ 2.4 billion for the first 9 months.
Since the crude oil prices have risen slightly, the invoice due to replacement costs results in a reduction in profits by 1 % for the quarter and 3 % for the first 9 months.The net sales remained almost unchanged in the 3rd quarter of £ 15.8 billion.Based on reduced the cost of the gross, the gross result increased by 13 % to £ 3.5 billion and the operating result by £ 41 %.
The more than doubled tax burden of 862 (385) million limited the increase in net profit to £ 815 (809).The quarter was characterized by a decline in profit by 37 % to £ 350 million in exploration and funding, which was, however, due to the special items of the previous year.With increased sales quantities and partly narrowed refinery margins, the downstream business showed an increase by £ 453 million.
In the chemical area, the loss of the previous year's quarter of £ 168 million changed into a profit of £ 158 million.In view of the seasonally increased demand in the northern hemisphere, the group expects a further recovery in crude oil prices for the last quarter.BT under growing competitive pressure london, Nov. 10 ug.
The intensive competition in the British telecommunications sector and the rigorous price reduction policy of the market regulator frequently at British Telecom (BT) have been reflected in a slight drop in profits, although the demand for telecommunications and products from the group continues to increase quickly.For the half -year expired at the end of September, a profit before taxes of 1.49 (i.V. 1.5) is shown.A special burden of £ 75 million was caused by the repurchase of half of the bonds, which had been estimated at £ 556 million, which had been in the hands of the government since privatization.
The tariff reductions carried out correspond to approximately 6 % of the group sales, which was 6.85 (6.76) billion.The reductions announced at the end of September are part of a price package of £ 400 million to the next August.As a result of the deeper fees, national talks contributed a turnover to 2.50 (2.57) mrd.
The strong competition, which is based on Mercury Communications and other domestic and foreign providers, manifested itself particularly clearly in international business, which experienced a decline in sales to 964 (995) million.A partial balance formed higher connection fees that were added to 1.25 (1.20) billion.At the end of September, the supervisory authorities in Europe and the United States had their consent to the participation of BT in 20 % of the MCI Communications Corp share capital.given.
Of the total costs of £ 2.86 billion, £ 1.94 billion have been written off as goodwill at the expense of the reserves, which are now still £ 10.02 billion.With the participation, BT wants to ensure that the international telecommunications market continues to play a leading role.BT has withdrawn from the US Society McCaw Cellular Communications, whose merger was completed with AT&T in September.
The resulting participation in AT&T with a stock market value of around $ 1.90 billion is to be sold shortly.The job cuts also continued in the last semester: 4,400 jobs were canceled.
The management assumes that it can reach the annual goal of 15,000 deleted positions.The intermediate dividend was increased by 6 % to 7.05 P per share.Performance and earnings figures of the VEBA group (monetary values in Mio. DM) January to September199994 sales49 19952 433strom8 96211 552CHEMIE7

Current construction events at the airport / / at Zurich Airport are currently not large construction sites in the company apart from the expansion of the operation center.Traffic in the freight area is currently being disturbed, where the supply channel continues from the airport head to the freight.
The increase in operating safety of the energy supply serves an additional line tunnel, which leads to the freight east under the Butzenbühl;He will later secure the ring closure of the system.The growth of world air traffic finds its visible expression on the airports in constant adaptation of existing buildings and systems to changed conditions and in extension and new buildings.
Wilhelm Bender, CEO of Frankfurt Airport at Main AG, emphasized when the new Frankfurt terminal was recently opened, and an airport without cranes had to be seen as a bad sign.Cranes and construction sites can now be seen again at Zurich Airport.However, they are in no connection with the 5th expansion stage, which is currently in front of the preparatory Commission of the Cantonal Council.
Extension III of the operating center has already grown far from the ground.The construction, as was learned by Hans Peter Brütsch, director of the Airport real estate company (FIG), was to be handed over to the Swisscontrol, Swiss Aktiengesellschaft für Air Safety, as a tenant in mid-1996.It will subsequently begin to install the new systems and devices that will open the way to the new millennium and ensure the connection to new technical world systems.
The new center is likely to be fully put into operation in spring 1998. “Glasses office building” will be ready to refer to the “glass office building” in front of the parking garage A.
Three floors are reserved for the cantonal police.There are also rooms for an airport doctor's office, logistics rooms for the banks and offices for various companies.Only next spring will FIG open its new forum (conference center) in the entrance stick, which is now housed in the airport plaza above the station hall.
In view of the economic uncertainty of the industry, contrary to the forecasts of 1980, not all rooms have yet been rented out, so that there is currently an oversupply of offices at the airport.In Terminal A, renovation and renovation of the “Fahnenhalle” are faced with the conclusion - it is a symbolic memory of the first airport terminal.Thanks to the installation of a spacious skylight, the hall has become lighter and airier;
The green-living plants in the Swissair-Check-in-Hallen has also found a sequel.The traditional colorful flag decoration, which is promised, is still missing.Construction changes are planned at the root of finger dock B.
The transit restaurant, which is almost somewhat hidden, is rebuilt and made more visible.The bar under the entrance staircase, the "stalactite cave", is closed, three shops and a bank are installed.The increase in parking garage A will soon be tackled by a level that - unlike today - is to be covered in order to convey a closed appearance to the building.
The FIG also builds for itself.In the next few weeks, a narrow old building will be canceled next to the heating center in the shipyard area.A new company building is created, which is so fundamentally found that it can be supplemented with an office tract, should the FIG need to withdraw from the "airport front" in the next few years.
The currently visible civil engineering work in the area of airport freewers serve to increase supply security with electricity and heat.From the airport head to the freight area, a new, walk -in cable canal is built for the supply of electricity, heat and water;In the area of the Fig office, a new substation of the heating system is created.
The construction work is difficult in that traffic must always be maintained, so that only in short stages can be built and the building installation site is scarce.A tunnel under the Butzenbühl attacked was the preparatory work for the 625 -meter -long supply tunnel, which made the connection to the freight east from the heating center of the FIG in the shipyard area under the Butzenbühl, where the two line strands are brought together.The channel of 3.2 meters wide and 3.65 meters high has a length of 625 meters, of which around 525 meters are pushed forward.
With the merger to the ring line, supply security can be significantly increased in the entire airport head.The same also applies to the new sub -plant at the height of the shipyard and along the railway embankment.In the future, two submissions will be available for supplying electrical energy.

More than new brush strokes at Cathay Pacific / / SX.Cathay Pacific, the Flag Carrier of the British Crown colony, is particularly affected by the political changes and the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong.
The airline belonging to the Swire Group is one of the most profitable airlines worldwide and also sees her home base in Hong Kong beyond the fate year 1997.Cathay documents this with a new design of her fleet.A lively brush stroke on the sideitus arouses associations with Asian ink painting.
The colors (white, gray, petrol and red) and the appearance reveal the manuscript of the European agency, which previously helped a new corporate identity (including British Airways, United Airlines).The new advertising slogan "In the Heart of Asia" also refers to a place of the airline founded in 1946 in the heart of Asia.But there are more than externalities:
A look at the fleet planning also shows that Cathay wants to use the Hong Kong turntable for further growth, especially in Asian-Pacific.In the past two months, Cathay took over the first two of a total of four leases Airbussen A-340, which were originally ordered internationally by Pakistan.In December, Cathay took over the first of eight A-330-300 with Trent drives from Rolls-Royce.
The A-330 replaces the Lockheed L-1011 in inner-Asian traffic, while the A-340, from which Cathay has firmly ordered six copies, is to be used in European traffic.The A-340 will also fly the route to Zurich.This aircraft with 260 seats corresponds to the traffic volume of European side centers such as Amsterdam, Rome or Zurich better than the Boeing 777 or the 747 - 400, which are too large with 300 or more places for a daily non -stop flight.
The Boeing 777a at Cathay replaces the Boeing 747 - 200 and -300.Cathay can take over the first of eight aircraft in March 1996.This will be Cathay the first airline that will have all three new large -scale aircraft in your fleet in addition to 747 - 400 with the Boeing 777 and the two Airbuses A -340 /330.

75 years of Swiss air traffic / / 75 years ago, on December 15, 1919, the AD Astra, Swiss Air Transport AG, was founded in Zurich.In addition to domestic traffic in 1922, she also started the international line service as the first Swiss society.
In 1931 the ad Astra joined the Balair to the Swissair.At the beginning of 1919, the Swiss Air Force began to build a courier service between Dübendorf and Bern, which from April extended with the transport of civil mail mail and passengers to Lausanne and Geneva.With this company, which only lasted half a year, military aviatics made pacemaker services to Swiss air traffic.
At that time, only the military pilots had flying-technical experiences;It was they who also gave impetus to found private airlines.On April 15, 1919, Alfred Comte and Walter Mittelholzer founded the “Aero Society, Air Period and Passenger Flights and Passenger Flights”;
With two aircraft taken over from German war stocks-enrollment CH-1 and CH-2-they set up a modest company on a small airfield near Schwamendingen-Zurich.The second company followed on June 25, the Avion Tourisme S. A. in Geneva, which used Italian flight boats for its sightseeing flights.At the same time, the subscription list for a “Swiss Society for Luft Tourism” was published in Dübendorf, to whose initiators, etc.Oskar Bider and the pilots Fritz Rihner, Henri Pillichody and Ernst Frick belonged.
As a temporary solution, the Frick & Co. company was built on September 20 shortly afterwards - on December 15, 1919 - was then founded in Zurich with a share capital of CHF 300,000.& Co. took over;Three months later she also acquired the company Comte, Mittelholzer & Co. and Hernach The Avion Tourisme S. A. The main base of the AD Astra was on the Zurichhorn, while in Bern-Oberlindach, Geneva, Rorschach, Lugano and Locarno.were entertained.
The operation with the 3 land and 13 aircraft was initially limited to circular flights to the Alps and the cities located on the lakes;Alfred Comte and Emilio Taddeoli were the chief pilot, Walter Mittelholzer, the head of the photo department.The leap into the poor results of the first years of operation soon led to a restriction of the offer at AD Astra.
On the other hand, the company was able to rent a modern transport aircraft cheaply from the Junkers and Dornier plants and thereby work more economically.In the spring of 1922, the AD Astra concluded a capital investment and business community contract with the German Junkers Air Traffic AG, which had searched for a concession for a daily airline in Nuremberg-Zurich-Geneva;Junkers made four new all-metal traffic aircraft of type F-13.
On June 1, 1922, the opening of this first international air traffic line in Switzerland took place (attempts for international connections took place two years earlier in Geneva, but had no success).122 passengers were promoted by the end of September, in 1923 there were 1158 passengers and 500 kg post, whereby Munich formed the starting point instead of Nuremberg.The air traffic crossing the national borders soon led to the formation of international business communities.
Even then, abroad brought the airlines to Switzerland because of their central location as well as the seat of the League of Nations.In August 1923, the British Handley Page Transport Ltd.Your London-Paris line three times to Basel and Zurich every week;
In 1924 the Belgian Sabena opened a line from Amsterdam via Rotterdam and Brussels to Basel, and the London Switzerland line took over the newly founded British Imperial Airways.A French society later followed the Paris Basel-Zurich-Vienna route and German companies from Hamburg and Berlin to Zurich and Basel.In this environment, the AD Astra, in which Walter Mittelholzer Henri Pillichody had now replaced as director, expanded its lines after abroad.
Political pressure to collaboration in 1925, Balair Air traffic 3-AG took up its business;She used her lines at home and abroad with Dutch Fokker aircraft.Although the two Swiss companies now had a larger proportion of the air traffic network, they had operating losses.
These unfavorable results prompted the Federal Air Office to stop two airlines for closer cooperation;In addition, they renewed their fleets in 1927, according to the Balair with eight-placed Fokker-F-VIIA machines.The ad Astra used the same large Dornier-Merkur aircraft, with which it set up an express service between Zurich and Berlin in 1928 and fought this longest non-stop route in Europe in 412 hours, an extraordinary performance at this time.
The following years served to consolidate the route networks;As a result of the subsidy policy of the Air Office, three -engine aircraft had to be purchased for the main lines.Both 1929 and 1930, Ad Astra and Balair were able to align a dividend.
The increasing competition from foreign companies and also the demands of the air ram forced the two companies to work more intensively;In order to enable a more rational community company, the merger was also initiated.On March 17, 1931, the shareholders of the AD Astra and March 26 agreed with the merger of the Balair on March 17, 1931.
Basel received the Presidium, Zurich was determined as the seat of the new company and the management was transferred to the previous directors of the two companies, Balz Zimmermann (1895 - 1937) and Walter Mittelholzer (1894 - 1937).The era of the pioneering period of Swiss air traffic came to an end.Alfred Waldis

New African air traffic society / / oh.Johannesburg, 13th
December the state South African air traffic society South African Airways (SAA), the governments of Tanzanias and Ugandas as well as the Uganda Airlines and the Air Tanzania have founded a new air traffic company under the name Alliance.The SAA participates with 40 % in the capital of society, the Air Tanzania and Uganda Airlines with 10 % each and the governments of Tanzania and Ugandas with 5 % each;30 % are reserved for private investors.
The Alliance plans to take up air traffic in March and first come to London, Dar es Salaam, Enebbe, Bombay, Dubai and Johannesburg.The SAA provides the Alliance a Boeing 747.It also trains the office of the new air traffic company and supports it in technical terms.
The South Africans promise an increased common use of the East and South African tourism potential from the joint venture, whereby the attractions of the two regions- the Kilimanjaro, the Krüger National Park and Cape Town- are to be marketed together.The SAA has too big aircraft park after rationalizing its European route network and has hired the flights to Manchester, Lisbon, Athens, Milan and Hamburg.Flight operations on domestic routes are profitable, but not international traffic.
In the 1993/94 financial year, SAA suffered an operational loss of 23 million approx.In the first half of 1994/95, however, it was achieved to win 18 million.to generate - the first positive result since 1990.

Negotiations between Swissair and Sabena / / / The negotiations on a Swissair participation in the Belgian airline Sabena will begin within a short time, as the Belgian transport minister confirmed on Thursday.A decision on the separation from Air France, which together with Belgian partners have a share of 37.5 % in Sabena, is said to be made in January;
According to Belgian newspaper reports, however, an amicable agreement has already been reached. Pmr.Brussels, December 15th Belgian Transport Minister, Elio Di Rupo, confirmed on Thursday that he received a Swissair negotiating proposal.
These goals in particular to strengthen the position of the Swiss company on the European market.According to the minister, the talks should begin in the “very short time”.With this statement, Di Rupo responded to a report by the Belgian daily newspaper “La Libre Belgique”, in which an announcement by the Swissair was promised about the start of the negotiations for Thursday.
According to the Belgian newspaper, a “divorce in mutual agreement” was agreed between the Air France and Sabena before the end of the year.The two airlines would separate, referring to the requirements of the European Commission, which do not allow the battered French society to help the Sabena, which is notoriously under -capitalized, in their further development with fresh money.The spokeswoman for the Belgian Minister of Transport said that there were no "official" decisions.
The results of a study on the collaboration between Sabena and Air France, on which the French Banque Lazard has been working since summer, would be expected at the end of December, so that official decisions can be expected in early January.However, the minister wants to start “working” with the Swissair while already analyzing the results of the study.Swissair participation of 49 percent?
Air France has had an indirect share of 25 % at Sabena since the spring of 1992.The French airline, together with four Belgian partners, had acquired 37.5 % of Sabena capital over the Zwischenholding Finacta.The Air France wore two thirds to the takeover price of a total of 6 billion BFR.
at .According to the report of the Belgian newspaper, the state, which has the rest of the Sabena capital in the hands, will buy the Finacta share back and then negotiate with the Swissair about a participation of 49 % as part of a capital increase.A Swissair share just below the majority is not only a good thing from considering national sensitivities on the Belgian side.
It also appears necessary so that the Sabena does not lose its status as an EU airline -and thus its main attraction for the Swiss side.New connection according to Paris-Orlyunter Exploitation of the EU's internal market, which is also gradually liberalized in air traffic, announced the Sabena on Thursday that it will fly to Paris Airport Orly three times a day on Thursday, the direct connection to the French regional flight network.In contrast to the Dutch KLM and the Austrian Lauda Air, which a few weeks ago with their airplans for Orly, the approval for the Brussels-Orly connection is already available, according to the Sabena spokesman.
The pendulum compound, which was entirely entirely entirely, together by Sabena and Air France with nine daily flights to Charles de Gaulle Airport, will also be maintained.Close cooperation from Swiss.The Swissair announced in a short communiqué that its board of directors authorized the management on Wednesday to take steps to move together with the Sabena;
At the same time, the board of directors has determined the conditions for the corresponding negotiations.According to the Communiqué, these conditions, which have to be considered to be confidential, are currently being discussed in a “promising sense”;The Swissair would enable participation in Sabena to strengthen their position in Europe, with “close cooperation” being considered.

New guidelines of Canada for air traffic / / FDR.Vancouver, December 22nd of the last cabinet meeting before the Christmas break, the government in Ottawa has adopted new air traffic guidelines with abroad.
However, they do not apply to traffic with the United States;Rather, in this case it is still being worked on a bilateral contract that basically aims at “Open Sky” relationships.The ideas of the respective negotiators still diverge far.
The new guidelines essentially contain a confirmation of the long -term status quo, as Canadian Airlines International (CAI), which is domiciled in the west of Canada, in Calgary, continues to focus on the currently increasingly growing routes in the Far East, but at the same timeMay serve Europe.Conversely, Air Canada will continue to have the main attitude on Europe.Specifically, the desire of Air Canada to be able to fly to Hong Kong in the future was therefore rejected.
What is new, on the other hand, is the criterion that a Canadian airline may apply for a destination, provided that this route is either not fully exploited by the competition or is not fleeing at all.Belgium and the Netherlands, for example, are in Air Canada's “portfolio”, but are not served.CAI could seek a “second carrier” right of flight here;
If no Canadian company - also no charter company - is interested, Ottawa ultimately reserves the right to take into account a foreign society.Minister of Transport Young emphasized that this regulation wanted to make it easier for foreign airlines to access Canada;At the same time, the local audience should be given a larger selection of both destinations and airlines.

Performed separation of the Air France from the Sabena / / PMR.Brussels, December 30th The official separation of the Air France from her 25%share in the Belgian airline Sabena seems to be delayed.
The Belgian Transport Minister DI Rupo has announced that his meeting with the President of the Air France Blanc was now planned to the Blanc of Algiers to mid -January.In Belgium, however, it is hardly doubted that Air France will return its stock package acquired in spring 1992 to the Belgian state.However, it does not seem to be clarified whether this will happen at the same price as two and a half years ago.
The Air France has 4 billion BFR for its package.(around CHF 163 million) paid.At the same time, four Belgian partners had another 12.5 % for 2 billion BFR.accepted .
Since the airline has always emphasized its significantly improved position in recent years, the Belgian partners in particular seem to have raised resistance to an overly "cheap" entry of Swissair.Contrary to the speculation in a Belgian newspaper, the Swiss side will in any case be less than 50 %.This was confirmed by the Swissair as well as from the Belgian side.

Flights only for official purposes / / / -ll- The canton of Zurich as a shareholder of the Swissair is not only entitled to dividends (provided that they are distributed, which was not the case in 1993 and 1994), but also receives flight bons worth 15 fre every year.
Anyone who benefits from the discounts that result from the connection between the state and the Swissair now wanted to know cantonal councilor Ruedi Keller (sp., Hochfelden), and the government council answered the corresponding parliamentary request these days.Airbons are made available by the canton, especially for business trips, for delegations from the cantonal council and for the police deportation of foreigners.If the stock allows it, flying can be submitted outside the months of July to September for research and study trips by magistrate's owners, civil servants, employees, employees, full-time teachers (without elementary school), professors, institute and seminar directors of the university and for third parties if the statethe costs covered completely.
No information on the amount "The flight bons are used exclusively for official purposes", the government council's answer, with around 60 to 70 percent on study and research trips as well as visits to congress, around 20 to 25 percent for deportations by the cantonal police and round5 to 20 percent are used for other business trips.In its answer, however, the government council has forgotten to mention which amount the canton the canton can make available to flight bons.It is pointed out that members of the Swissair Board of Directors fly free of charge - unless they are traveling in connection with their other professional activity.
Officials from the airport directorate also benefit from the Zurich Airport Directorate.If the federal government has a significant interest in a business trip by officials from the airport directorate, it provides the corresponding flight ticket free of charge.Finally, employees of the Apron Control office (transport service) complete a so-called Obererver flight on board a Swissair or Crossair aircraft as part of their further training;

"Nomex": Heat-resistant fiber for heat and flame protection / / tr.
For the 25th anniversary of the first landing of people on the moon, old-fashioned, but always astonishing video recordings flicker over the screens.During a slow pace, Neil Armstrong and Edward Aldrin hopped with their cumbersome oxygen supply on the back in a completely gray landscape that is gently contoured by millions of meteorite attacks
around.The prints of their boots are likely to have existed there for millions of years.
From the moon to the earth to the earth, white suits of the astronauts were a survival protective skin under the extreme, absolutely hostile conditions of the moon.The fiber of the “Space Suits” had selected NASA due to a relentless evaluation procedure.The Nomex developed by Dupont was awarded the contract: it was considered a sensation in the 1960s and has remained unmatched to this day.
Nomex belongs to the class of meta-aramide fibers;Aramid is the abbreviation for "aromatic amide".Benzol rings are arranged close together in such polymer chains, which creates stiff molecular chains with high temperature stability and heat resistance.
According to the official definition, at least 85 percent of the amid groups are bound directly to two aromatic rings (mostly benzene rings) in Aramid fibers.In the Nomex macromolecule, the benzene rings are bound in meta position;This gives you a stiff, chemically and thermally unusually stable molecule.
Nomex is characterized by a remarkable temperature resistance and outstanding mechanical and electrical properties.The endlessly spun fiber is processed into stacks, yarn, paper and cardboard, which can be used in the long term at temperatures up to 200 OC, when the dimension is fully preserved.Only at almost 400 OC Nomex charred, but without dripping and burning.
A large family from the beginning of the space age has developed an entire family of products from the exotic specialty.First came Nomex III, which contains 5 percent para-aramid fiber Kevlar.It does not shrink at a high temperature either: it is mainly manufactured from it protective suits for firefighters, author racing drivers, exposed staff in industrial companies and offshore platforms as well as military personnel.
At the beginning of the nineties, improved product series followed in the Nomex Delta series for protective clothing and as filter material for hot industrial exhaust gases.Nomex Delta A has permanent antistatic properties;This is thanks to the shinging of a carbon masher covered with nylon.
Delta C is a mixture of particularly fine nomex fibers with an improved handle and comfort.The product is suitable for the production of knitted goods and ultra -light textiles.Delta FF is even finer, it is used for feed fabrics and laundry.
Finally, thanks to a Kevlar share of 23 percent, Delta T offers a further improved thermal protective effect.Both fibers are colored with pigments in the spinning process.In electrical engineering, nomex paper is widespread as an insulation material.
It consists of short fibers and fiber -like binding particles that are referred to as fibrids.The latter are made directly from the polymer under high shear load and suspended in water together with the short fibers.From this, an endless railway is produced on a conventional paper machine and compressed by calanders.
The alignment of the short fibers in the direction of the paper machine means that the mechanical properties are very directional.Nomex paper, with or without the addition of mica, is primarily used to insulate transformers and engines and ensures better protection against thermal overload and a longer lifespan.As a replacement for environmentally hazardous, oil-cooled transformers, there are now compact, nomex-insulated dry transformers.
Copper and iron are also saved.Nomex wabbar material is very light, impact, vibration-damping and heat-insulating.It is used for indoor and outdoor elements in aircraft and shipbuilding as well as in helicopter rotor blades and skis.
Less exotic applications of nomex paper are labels and lampshades.The latest applications of the NOMEX fibers include fire-repellent carpets, ironing and presser towels for laundries as well as hose reinforcements in the car engine.It is mainly fleece fabrics and needle felt.
The latter are processed from an unknown textile structure by treatment with special bars to a uniformly dense and flexible product.The filter hoses produced from this are widespread in asphalt, cement and lime works as well as in the metal industry.Nomex needle felt and fabric find a wide range of applications in the increasingly compact and therefore hot laser sprinters as well as copying and faxing devices, especially for the storage and transmission of lubricants.
Nomex was produced exclusively in Richmond (Virginia, USA) for the European Aira.A nomex paper factory has been in operation at Osaka (Japan) since 1990.In order to supply European customers, the construction of a nomex work at Oviedo in northwestern Spain began in 1991.
In order to create jobs in economically disadvantaged Asturias, the DuPont was provided with a full industrial site of 345 hectares.The EUR $ 200 million subsidized by the EC to 30 percent.There is enough space for a total of five chemical plants;
The second work, which is intended for the production of tetrahydrofuran (THF), is currently under construction.THF is required for the production of polyther glycol, the main component of the Lycra fiber and the hydrel polymers.In the final expansion, the Asturium site will employ around 1,000 employees, for which investments must be made of one billion dollars.
Despite the loose development, only half of the available country is used.The rest is expanded into a refuge for the primeval fauna and flora of Asturia, including a lake and a swamp landscape for water birds.The grass is not mowed in this protective zone;
Rather, a small herd of animals of the rare local breeds (cows, horses, sheep) ensures the maintenance of the site.The construction of the very complex nomex work, which takes into account the latest knowledge in terms of technology, security and environmental protection, was a real challenge for the construction companies and suppliers in Asturium.In a record time of two years, the work was completed on time, without serious accidents and under the budget;
Then production could be started right away.All critical pipelines are carried out double -walled and overcome to ensure immediate access to maintenance work.The work does not emit any pollutants: if always possible, by -products are added to a useful purpose or then used thermally.
When leaving the biological wastewater treatment plant, the water is cleaner than before it is used in the factory.Only air flows out of the fireplaces, which is enriched with water vapor and carbon dioxide.Polymerization and spinning process for raw materials for the production of nomex (meta-phenylendiamine and isophthaloyl chloride) are imported from the USA.
They are released into Dimethylacetamid (DMAC) and leads them to the continuous polymerization reactor.It basically consists of a pipe that was bent several times;The throughout and temperature determine the degree of polymerization, i.e. the length area of the molecules.
The polymerization provides a chain consisting of Benzolringen, which are connected to each other via peptide bonds (CO = NH groups).After the addition of pigments, the material is pressed from a titanium alloy by nozzles and spun by evaporating the solvent using hot nitrogen.The resulting monofilament endless fibers are washed to remove the last traces of the solvent.
Then they are dried, moved out four times their length and ruffled to give them the grip of a natural fiber.After supplying the necessary amount of Kevlar, the fiber is treated with an antistatic agent, cut on the length requested by the customer, mixed and pressed into bales.Of course, all of these operations are automated;

Stormy reception for the first Swissair-A-321 / / MET.The reception for the first Airbus A-321 of the Swissair in Zurich could not have stopped stormy on Wednesday.
After the one-hour overflight from the factory airport of the German Aerospace Airbus in Hamburg-Finkenwerder, the west wind tower weather made it impossible to find the usual approach from north to slopes 14 or 16;So the bad weather route had to be chosen east and south of Winterthur.Despite the most violent gusts and the necessary mass
“Hand”, Captain and A-321 chief instructor Kasimir Bieli put on the brand new aircraft HB-IOA “Lausanne” in the early afternoon on the west slope.Roll out to the arch hangar.The first had handled itself in the morning where the "Lausanne" was assembled.
With the signing of the transfer documents by Swissair director President Otto Loepfe as part of a small ceremony on the Airbus site on the bank of the Elbe, the renewal of the Swissair short and medium-haul fleet, «with a capital expenditure of CHF 2.35 billion, has the largest in the history of64 year old company »(comparisons NZZ No. 255), began.Over the next two and a half years, a further 28 aircraft from the A-320 family (including the A-321 shorter versions A-319 and A-320 adopted on Wednesday) will arrive in Zurich.They replace the McDonnell Douglas MD-81 and the large-scale aircraft Airbus A-310. «Antizeyclic» Loepfe emphasized in Hamburg that Swissair behaves in a certain sense with the great procurement project if they invest in the latest technology at a time, since the traffic air tripThe effects of the recession are still clearly felt and airlines tend to tend to vose planes instead of obtaining new ones.
However, Swissair is healthy enough to take the step now.In addition, the company could look back on a traditional pioneering role in the introduction of new aircraft and has shown itself through a good feeling for promising products.And it is precisely these qualifications that apply to the A-320 aircraft family.
The Swissair boss referred to the efforts of the new fleet to be particularly proud of the environmental rights with particular pride.With the chosen new French-American engine, which is first built into the A-321 of the Swiss carrier, the aircraft noise will be halved again compared to the now excreting European.Lower fuel consumption and sometimes significantly cheaper pollutant values - the specified destinations have not yet been achieved here - are added.
No airline can afford to ignore environmental bonds today.Because the Swissair wanted to be a good neighbor in Zurich and Geneva to the airport residents in Zurich and Geneva, the additional money spent was undoubtedly well invested.Loepfe named the fact that the Airbus is a European product as the last advantage of the procurement.
Europe remains the crucial home market for the Swissair, and a good partnership with the European aviation industry is therefore in their interest.During and after the overflight from Hamburg to Zurich, the celebration was also dedicated to the celebration on the shipyard area in Kloten.Eleanor Margaret Purser, member of the European Youth Parliament from Great Britain, called for an effort to recognize the mutual dependencies on our continent.

Record utilization of the Swissair / / GT.The Swissair announced in a communiqué that it transported 8.36 (7.78) million passengers last year;
This record status was reached in 1994 with a considerable growth rate of 7.5 (4.7)% compared to only 1.9% in 1992. 68.9 (64.9) was also given in the overall average overall load of the aircraftNew maximum value reached, which is 7.2 percentage points above the low in 1992.The entire loaded transport performance was increased by 9.9 (10.3)% to 3.24 (2.95) million toned kilometers (TKM), whereby the freight / post area with an increase of 13.2 (16.1)% again expanded above average, while the passenger area with 7.4 (6.2)% was able to register slightly higher growth than in 1993.
The seat utilization, which had dropped to only 60.3 % in 1992, increased to 63.4 (61.5) % in 1994.In 1994, as in 1993, Swissair increased more on the intercontinental routes than in European traffic.For example, the increase in demand was 10.7 % on the long distances, 5.8 % in Europe.
The largest increase was achieved in Africa with 18.5 (15.6)%;This is followed by the Far East with 12.2 % (such as I. V.), whereby Japan, especially thanks to the Osaka operation recorded in September, shone with an increase of 36.0 %, and the North Atlantic with 12.3 (12,1)% .In the Middle East, demand increased only slightly, namely by 1.2 (2.1)%, while on the South Atlantic with an increase of only 0.1 (6.9)%, in contrast to the previous year, it was practically stagnating.
The record utilization of 68.9 % mentioned at the beginning was therefore achieved because this increase in demand could be achieved with an offer increased by only 3.6 %.In this context, Swissair again emphasizes that in 1994 - like the previous year - by a further erosion of the tariffs, to which the weakness of important foreign currencies was added to Swiss francs;According to the Communiqué, the income was therefore unable to follow the increase in demand and should thus significantly impair the annual result.

"Open Sky" offer from the USA to Switzerland / / SNA.When it comes to air traffic, according to the various disillers of recent times (failure of the Alcázar project, cooling of the relationship Swissair / SAS, deficient flight operations by Swissair, delayed admission of bilateral negotiations with the EU in the traffic sector) can finally be once again gratifying for SwitzerlandEvent to be referred.
According to the agency reports last Thursday, the Swiss authorities and eight other European small states were submitted by the US transport ministry for a so-called open sky air ride.Although no details of the contract text have been announced, according to the Swiss Depesque Agency, which refers to well -taught sources, it contains the principles sought by Switzerland of mutual liberalization of air traffic.After Switzerland was interested in such an agreement with the United States about four years ago, in contrast to the Dutch, however, no corresponding agreement was able to negotiate before the change of government, this time the chances of successful completion seem to be favorable.
A year and a half after the submission of a new desire - with the American partner of the Swissair, the Delta Airlines, could now obviously be overcome as a drafting advocate in the back - the initial obstruction tactics of the other large American carriers.For the Swiss airline, which is increasingly relying on the American market after the negotiation policy difficulties in the EU space, a rapid breakthrough in the negotiations - the signing of the contract is expected in two to three months.As the most important advantage, the Swissair would in future be possible to charge any destination in the United States, without in any case it would be possible to request a new approval of the US authorities.

25. Davoser World Economic Forum / / TS.Davos, January 31, organizers of the Davos World Economic Forum, which officially ended on Tuesday, have the less modest claim to track down those topics from politics, business, science and art that will be important in the current year.
But actually the whole thing is an event for business leaders (and a few business leaders) from all over the world to continue to establish them on their network of relationships.The official events give them reason for this;The conversations on the edge of the events are much more important- on the edge of the ski slope or during lunch and dinner in the numerous Arven and Graubündenstuben.
But the managers don't come alone, but accompanied.However, there is little known about the women who accompany their men at this meeting (the men who accompany their women are rather sparsely represented).Around 700 wives found their way to Davos this year (compared to 1500 participants in official mission), not just out of love for their husbands.
The Davos Symposium offers the companions something unique: in contrast to other conferences at which the events are reserved for the experts and the support is limited to the supporting program, the women have been equal for a year - at least what access to the lectures andPodium talks concerned.This type of equality that women experience is well received;
Many were interested and committed to the discussions.However, the audience was very male -heavy with various political and most economic issues.A separate program had been set up for those companions who were looking for some variety.
Not only the winter sports side of women was addressed, the organizers also aimed at their psychological interests.A workshop about non -violent communication and all -day deep psychological intensive training were available.It remains to be seen whether one or the other husband could also have benefited from this offer.
There was also a scramble for participating in an spin course for which a well -known automobile manufacturer was concerned.The same company also provided numerous vehicles - their latest model series - in which the prominence plagued by the deadline pressure was made around: in front of this car, as a pedestrian, it was better in the five days, which the business forum lasted, more in eight (further article inEconomic part)

No crash of the Swissair into the red numbers / / SNA.In the middle of the negotiating poker for the Swissair's participation in the Belgian airline Sabena, the Swiss aviation company, which is otherwise rather reserved in its information policy in a short communiqué Schwarze figures for the 1994 financial year.
Despite the massive sales recovery due to the high Franconian course last year, the group management expects both the group and the airline with a "slightly positive" result.According to the press release, the overall revenue compared to the previous year could be increased, which is primarily due to the gratifying results of Swissair investments AG (SBAG) and the Crossair.In addition, the measures taken on the output side had increasingly affected cost -dusting.
As early as 1993, the annual profit of the Swissair Air Travel Society was melted from CHF 20.8 million to CHF 6.7 million, while the group had generated a net profit of 59 (I. 113) MiO..Without the burden on the revenue side, which was considered serious as a result of the continued high -altitude flight of the Franconian, the previous year's result could have been significantly exceeded according to the Swissair.The group management also praised the development of traffic demand, the utilization and labor productivity at the Swissair airline.

Sabena looking for cost savings / / / The negotiations of the Swissair for participation in the Belgian Sabena have stalled according to the Brussels Minister of Transport Di Rupo.The Belgian airline had come across the government's contradiction with a plan to reduce its social costs.
Swissair is now thinking about a new offer that, according to Di Rupos, could provide an intervention by the Belgian government.Brussels, 2. Februarmit of its current cost level, the Belgian airline Sabena only seems to be an attractive partner for Swissair under restrictions.
The communicative Belgian Transport Minister Elio Di Rupo, who has already caused some excitement in the negotiations on Swissair participation in the needy Sabena, openly admitted on Wednesday before the Belgian Senate that the Swiss interlocutors have the situation after the collaboration was failedwanted to rethink between Sabena and Luxair.He expects a new offer from Swissair, which could contain the demand for a "substantial intervention" of the Belgian government.Fourteen days ago, according to the socialist minister, an agreement was within reach.
This almost degree was based on a constructive offer of Swissair, the good relationships with the Air France and the Sabena board of directors, to have a collaboration with the Luxair.However, after the Luxair project had shattered, one is far from a solution and, like in a domino game, has to start building the stones again.Social policy problems of the Eudie's statement by the minister and the prelude to the past few days have revealed how convulsively Sabena is looking for cost savings in order to be a sufficiently solid partner in the eyes of the Swissair.
Di Rupo illuminated the drama of the situation a few days ago when he explained that the connection with Swissair was the only serious chance of survival for the Belgian airline.Due to the failed Luxair project, Sabena hoped her wage costs around 800 million BFR.Up to 1 billion BFR.
Press per year.She wanted not only part of her fleet with Luxair Poolen, but above all her 450 pilots to Luxembourg.The state social contributions, which only make up a quarter of the Belgian level in the Grand Duchy, would have made it possible to save the cost.
If the 9,600 employees of Sabena were falling under English law, a Belgian newspaper calculated, even 2.5 billion BFR could be calculated annually.be deleted in social costs.However, both the Luxembourg and the Belgian finance minister reported energetic protest against the hollowing out of the social policy “morality” by a company that is 62 % in state property.
The impulsive Sabena boss Godfroid then complained in an open letter to the Belgian finance minister Maystadt at the beginning of this week that he drives up the jobs of Sabena employees through outdated dogmas and slogans.If the government suspended its companies in the hard international competition within the European Union, it must also allow it to choose the most socio -political system in the EU.Otherwise they would have to suffer from unfair competition.
After apparently sharp arguments in the Belgian cabinet, the transport minister leaned out of the outrage of his Christian social colleague in the finance department and declared a "pure delocalization" that is not based on economic realities, unacceptable.Under the aegis of his Christian Democratic predecessor, today's Prime Minister Dehaene, Belgium had already flagged his merchant navy to Luxembourg in 1988.Too little sabena pilot?
The Sabena pilots had already drawn attention to the extremely distressed cost situation of their airline a week ago.They complained about increasing overtime and the resulting security problems because the hiring of new staff does not keep up with the rapid expansion of the air network.However, their announced actions were limited to some flight delays last Saturday.
One of the most important prerequisites for the entry of Swissair at Sabena still appears to be avoided by Air France on their Sabena participation.Air France President Christian Blanc had already announced the fundamental willingness to sell at the end of January in an interview with the newspaper “Le Monde”.As an Air France spokeswoman told the SDA news agency on Thursday, the fundamental decision was made.
Now it's about determining the conditions.The French aviation company has been holding two thirds of the Zwischenholding Finacta for almost three years, which in turn has 37.5 % of Sabena capital.The remaining third of the finacta shares are in the hands of four Belgian financial groups.

General growth in Zurich air traffic / / last year over 14.5 million passengers have been counted in Zurich Airport;This means an increase of 7.4 percent compared to 1993.
The freight transports and the airmail also show considerable growth rates.The number of flight movements has increased by 3.7 percent to a total of 242,498 starts and landings;So it has increased less than the number of passengers.
In the airport bill, a net profit of CHF 11.3 million is shown.More traffic- less delay- the growth of Zurich air traffic in all sectors can be seen from the table, in which traffic development after line and charter traffic as well as private air traffic (General Aviation) is broken down.
The top day in passenger traffic was July 30, 1994, a Saturday on which 67,092 travelers were recorded;This is the highest daily total to date for Zurich Airport.The daily average was 39,927 passengers.
- The SBB passenger counting system in the airport station registered 6.98 million people last year, which corresponds to an increase of 2.8 percent compared to the previous year.The number of flight movements at night (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) has increased from 4890 to 5521, which corresponds to a share of around 2 percent of all starts and landings.For the main thing, these movements took place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. 30;
117 movements eliminated the period between 11:30 p.m. and 0:00 a.m.Around half of these permits concerned outpatient clinic, auxiliary and rescue flights.
The delays have decreased: more than half, namely 54 percent of all departures in line traffic took place on time or with a delay of less than 5 minutes (in 1993 this was only the case with 47 percent of the departures).Delays of more than 15 minutes occurred at 14 percent (previous year 20 percent) of all departures in line traffic.
The financial success of the 1994 airport bill resulted from an effort of CHF 277.7 million and a yield of CHF 289 million a net profit of CHF 11.3 million (previous year CHF 2 million), which in the state treasuryflows.In addition, depreciation on the invested capital and CHF 18.7 million was remunerated by the canton of CHF 29.2 million.In 1994, Zurich Airport generated a total of CHF 59.2 million in profit, amortizations and interest, while it was CHF 45.4 million in the previous year.

A binational (and bicantonal) crack nut / / against the two 34 million loans for the expansion of the Basel-Mülhausen (Euro-Airport) airport, through which the cantonal parliaments of both Basel have to be located in January / February, is with a referendumarithmetic if the state contract between France and Switzerland is not legally binding for the protection of the environment and for the population directly affected by aircraft noise.AROUND.
Basel, January 4th of Basel-Mülhausen Airport, the third state airport in Switzerland, is of essential transport and economic policy importance for northwestern Switzerland.It is designed for the handling of 1.8 million passengers annually, but he already reached an emergence of 2.7 million passengers in 1997.
The expansion of the airport has been up for discussion since the beginning of the nineties.The investment project 1997-2004 also sees the expansion of the passenger terminal and the creation of a Y-shaped finger dock, the expansion of the apron, the optimization of the freight terminal, the extension of the east-west slope by 220 meters, improvements in the technicalAnd general infrastructures, the construction of a workshop, the development of a zone for commercial activities and the acquisition of land.The cost of this construction phase is around CHF 379 million in which the airport participates with 246 million (65 %);
The remaining 35 percent (CHF 133 million) are declared as a state investment contribution, half of which is to be financed by France and Switzerland.Half of the Swiss contribution is to be achieved from the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft.Since the federal government appears as a guarantee of the French-Swiss state treaty concluded to the Basel-Mülhausen Airport, the federal councils in the past winter session as part of the supplementary loan in 1998 have approved a commitment loan of CHF 66.7 million, which would then be carried out ifThe two Basel semi -cantons would not approve their shares of 34 million each.
When discussing the further expansion of the euro airport, the focus is on two aspects: the economic importance of the airport for the region and the quality of life in the nearby area of the airport.At the airport, 133 different companies are located with around 5,000 jobs, and about 30 percent of the employees are resident in Switzerland.The governments of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft do not want to turn the euro airport an intercontinental airport, which does not exclude that from Basel-Mülhausen, individual long-haul flights can also be offered.
But it continues to be used for prosperity.For 2007, 99,000 flights are forecast with 4.4 million passengers and 180,000 tons of freight traffic.At the air freight, the threshold of 100,000 tons was exceeded for the first time with 104 317 tons.
Passenger traffic also increases from month to month.With 220,497 passengers, November alone is 10 percent above the comparison month of last year.Clearly opposite people in the municipalities of Allschwil and Binningen are increasing the complaints about increasing aircraft noise.
The population also complains that it is not very heard with her concerns at the airport directorate and is not taken seriously at all.It sounds similar in Alsace.The commissioning of a semi -mobile measuring station in Bartenheim in Alsatian has recently allowed to charge flight routes, aircraft noise and air quality within a radius of 360 degrees.
So far, the noise could only be recorded south of the euro airport.However, the mobile stations are not welcome everywhere, because some French mayors fear that the effectively measured noise could not be as strong as the complaining population claims.The aircraft industry has also made considerable efforts to reduce environmental pollution in recent years.
The noise carpet of an Airbus A -320 is around twenty times lower than that of an old Boeing 727 - 200 from the 1960s.The governments of both Basel also build on the further expansion of Basel-Mülhausen to clear editions that they have deposited at the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek): The “Direct Start Hochwald” is to be limited to a maximum of 8 jetsOn the other hand, it is not ready to justify only 6 direct starts).Today's slope use concept is to be revised with the aim of objectively minimizing the noise pollution for the residents.
An extension of the east-west slope by at least 220 meters in 1999 is to lead to a well-known reduction in flight movements on the north-south slope.Exceptional permits between midnight and 5 a.m. are to be handled restrictively.Through the airport, pollutant -dependent landing tax must be introduced.
Finally, the connection of the airport would have to be ensured to the public rail network.The governments of the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft expressly find that if they are not adhered to these requirements or non-realization of certain parts of the investment project by the airport, they would at best shorten the investment contributions they have to be made.If the extension of the east-west runway is not realized, no funds would be paid out.
Formation of an opposing committee for the opponents of the loan templates are too little concrete and also not scheduled.The demands of the residents were not accepted.The investment contribution or any reduction must be linked more to the fulfillment of the requirements.
Representatives of political parties and environmental protection organizations have already formed a committee of both Basel “Airport loans no” before the cantonal parliamentary laments were treated.The referendum and thus an upcoming referendum in the coming spring should therefore be certain.
In contrast, supporters claim that only the approval of the investment contributions enables influence on the development of the airport and the environmental impact.The requirements are realistic and could be met.The economic importance of expansion for the airport and the region is also emphasized.

SR 111: "Stubborn after checklist" in ruin?: Communication in the crisis / / crew of the Swissair flight 111 did the emergency situation on September 2nd last year "too stubbornly according to checklist", the accusation of amateur aunt, but also some with the piloting of the MD-11 practitioners.
To discredge the checklists, even after the Halifax catastrophe, there is no reason to explain the arguments of the Swissair managers for the MD-11 pilot corps plausibly.Somewhere in the world, the horror happens a few times every year: the aircraft over the slope threshold was carefully brought close to the offspring, the flaps are set in accordance with the prescriptions and begins to pull on the control column in order to easily lift the nose for putting on.
Alone - the bird does not want to and does not want to go to the ground, floats endlessly.Then it crashes, first far behind, then also under the pilot seats.There are checklists for the fact that each crew even under high “workload” thinks that the chassis must be extended before landing.
Depending on the complexity of the aircraft, they are different from some leaves to - for airliners - thick rolls.One of these folders, those who are conducted in the Swissair in the cockpits of the MD-11, and the "philosophy", as should be used by the checklists on board in abnormal situations, has been a controversy in some media for some timeA polemic in the corridor - even if it is still not known and, in the best case, will probably remain unknown for months, which triggered the disaster off the coast of Neuschottland on September 2nd last year.Long list of accusation matter is that the MD-11 of the course SR 111 at travel flight height of 10,000 meters was about 70 nautical miles from the Halifax Airport in question, as co-pilot Stephan Löw told the Canadian pilot that there wereSmoke in the cockpit.
It was 10:14 p.m. at that time.16 minutes later, at 10:30 p.m., the MD-11 opened on the water.With the help of these two corner values, a dairy girl's bill that has been scored, which comes to the conclusion that if the crew had immediately opened to a direct arrival towards Halifax, would have been saved.
And the list of allegations to the crew (and to the Swissair) is long.The pilots would have lost too much time for the discussion about whether Boston or Halifax was to be controlled;You would have taken too much to order the order in the cabin for the emergency landing (tidying up after dinner).
Then, after a request from Halifax, how much fuel the MD-11 had on board, they would have deepened too much into the question of overweight (of around 12 tons with a total weight of 230 tons).Curves on the open ocean to drain kerosene cost valuable time."Even if the plane was a little too heavy, in the worst case it would have overwhelmed the end of the slope with maybe 10 to 20 knots," trusted a chief pilot and MD-11 captain of an American airline on December 16 to the "Wall Street Journal"at .
Furthermore, the specification of Löw, the remaining 25 miles were not sufficient to reduce the amount of 6000 meters to Halifax at that time.«You can slow down the jet, drive out the chassis to create additional resistance and fly S-curves.If you do this right, the plane drops like a stone, »said the same US MD-11 pilot.
A former Air Force bomber pilot and Boeing-727 captain underlines this statement in the "Wall Street Journal": The direct arrival on Halifax would have been "with ease". "Smoke of Unknown Origin" The main criticism of the crew and the Swissair is equal:
The two pilots were stubbornly followed by checklist instead of immediately initiating the Approach towards Halifax by improvisation.So the Swissair crews have just been trained, and so it wanted the culture of the Swiss airline (and the majority of other carriers). What checklist did Captain Urs Zimmermann and Löw work out at all?We viewed the part overwritten with “Smoke / Fumes of Unknown”.
In contrast to the same checklists of other companies, he is only a page long.The checklist for “smoke removal” (smoking distance) is also set by this brevity and in very large writing (readability in smoke development, an apprenticeship from a critical fire on a short -haul flight from Munich to Zurich).With the “Smoke / Fumes of Unknown Origin” checklist, the cabin power supply including lighting is first left (the flight attendants cleaned up the cabin after eating in the light of flashlights).
Then the attention applies to a rotary switch with three possible positions.Each puts part of the electrical systems out of operation;In one case, the screens of the captain become black in another of the co-pilot.
The aim of the procedure is to isolate and shut down the source of the smoke.In addition, the “smoke” part of the checklist mainly performs, which is no longer available in which switch position of the crew.What does the one who is responsible for this checklist on the basis of the manufacturer's regulations?
Ruedi Bornhauser, active captain on this aircraft type and additionally technical pilot MD-11, carried out all acceptance test flights with the Swissair-MD-11 and repeated them according to the large overhaul of the aircraft.So what does he think of the allegations of the crew and Swissair - also of the determination that in the series of manipulations listed is the reference to the emergency landing in the first place?Above all, he cannot understand one thing:
The simple bills with the time span, which passed from the first message to smoke in the cockpit to the crash, left out that a crew always had to be assumed from a current position assessment.SR 111 first discontinued a “Pan, Pan, Pan” message, which means that you require priority treatment through air traffic control.This suggests that the situation did not seem so threatening at that time.
Only six minutes before the catastrophe, Zimmermann and Löw also called “Emergency” (emergency) into the microphone.Even after the emergency call, the crew was able to make times of the pilots that had to read a dial of a two and a half centimeter dial.The situation on board must have escalated drastically relatively late;
For a long time, it was apparently assessed by the pilots in such a way that a risky (non-precision) approach with a "crazy" sink profile on an airport unknown to them and was out of the weight.»The MD-11 would have been possible: Bornhauser points out that the MD-11 can drop at a maximum of 4500 feet (1500 meters) per minute;The maximum value is given by the maximum speed of the MD-11 from Mach 0.87;
There is a risk that the aircraft will suffer structural damage.In any case, an aircraft must be operated within a “Enveloppe” specified by the manufacturer.The consequences of further loads are not estimated for the crew (and also not checked in the simulator).
For equally uncertain feet, Bornhauser claims that the crew had only a little risk if it had made a direct landing despite being overweight.After all, the jet with fuel was refueled for crossing the Atlantic, so that a crash landing could have had catastrophic consequences.Bornhauser finally has no understanding for the accusation that the MD-11- «Smoke» checklist contains no indication of the use of oxygen mask in the Swissair version-in contrast to that of Delta and Fedex.
This is a (trained) a matter of course, for which it does not require a paper indicator.The same applies to the decision to land.«We are not a trained monkey, but are capable and willing to do what the situation requires due to current positional assessments.»
The SR-111 crew was clear that the question was only, based on a risk analysis, the question was only how quickly it had to happen.Incidentally, this is also a question of the "Basic Education".Seen in this way, the accusation of the excessive checklist loyalty as it is made in the Swissair house to the crews.
Thanks to the checklist, the two pilots would have known under growing and later catastrophic stress at all times what they had to do.The controversy to evaluate SR 111 remains delicate, all the more than numerous puzzles of the solution and nobody knows what the accident crew had in the last six and a half minutes of functional.Just so much: The fact that the world's heaviest aviation disaster in the past year speaks about the question of adequate emergency procedures is in itself nothing bad;
The high security standard of today's world air traffic owes a lot to the analysis and discussion of accidents.The advice of those who, in the knowledge of how catastrophic the situation on board SR 111 escalated in the last few minutes, are unfair and dubious.And we consider the formula to be dangerous, more improvisation in the cockpits in emergencies bring more security.
Occupings work as teams that change almost every day;It doesn't work without standardizations.Modern commercial aircraft with their computer technology often impossible to understand pilots to understand what is going on behind the screens;
What to do without clear instructions?And thirdly: transatlantic flights are mostly winding hundreds of thousands of nautical miles of airports.The petty and dilettant 16-minute calculation of Halifax was unnecessary, in this case the insulation of a smoke or fire source, the most promising is according to the checklist .------------------ Communication in the crisis experience from the flight accident in halifaxge.
The crash of the MD-11 Swissair off the coast of Canada triggered passengers, flying staff and in international aviation.With a widely recognized performance, the Swiss airline has managed to avert the almost inevitable loss of the reputation of a company in such a serious event.What did the Sair Group do inside and out to avoid that the previously unexplained accident resulted in a crisis of the company?
This question was the focus of a panel event by Swiss Aviatik journalists.Béatrice Tschanz, head of the Sair Group, Manfred Brennwald Group Communication, took part in the conversation at Kloten Airport.in the introduction to your presentation, but in a specific case it usually turns out differently than you thought.In particular, emotions that are increasingly to the fore in today's information preparation cannot be planned.
Fast information is first handed, with swinging with completeness.Grundfalsch can be seen until you know more.This leaves the field open for speculation that, once brought into circulation, are no longer to be broken.
A hurdle in the factual information is the simplification in view of the technically demanding matter.The former journalist wished the media that the employees commissioned had an appropriate specialist knowledge on the editorial offices.On the part of the company, it was primarily important to let the leadership and specialists publicly have their say.
As a stroke of luck, the head of communication described the fact that at the time of the accident, the top managers were in Zurich and were therefore able to take the lead in the crisis staff without loss of time.Christian Klick shared the opinion that a company had to show faces in a crisis situation that strengthen credibility.With faster and straightforward information, it must be made clear that a company does not lose control even in a difficult case.
Klick pointed out that with CNN's global presence, the airlines were hardly able to comment on a flight accident with a report on site.In the case of code sharing flights, the partners would have to talk about crisis scenarios.The work of Delta Airlines when the Halifax crashed was given the best grades on the part of the Swissair.
Avoiding doubts about communication inwards spoke inwards.He referred to the difficulty of reaching the flight personnel scattered in all corners of the world with direct information and dealt with the long -term processing of the shock.The fact that a lot of time expires until the cause of the accident spreads a lot of time.
Information holes that could offer space for doubts must avoid it.It is better to say that you don't know more than to mention for a long time.The different communication needs of the employees must also be carefully weighed up.
For example, they offer those who are looking for the conversation, this help, do not urge others who do not want to roll up the topic again and again.It was agreed in the competent round that the pressure continues to last.The Sair Group will put the aerospace industry in the picture in due course.

A monument to the early aviation / / The Hamburg airport building built 70 years ago by the architectural team Dyrssen & Averhoff is to be replaced by a new building next year.This destroys one of the oldest and most advanced terminals in its time.
However, it would be quite conceivable to integrate this valuable building into the new building of the Gerkan, Marg and Partner.In the late twenties, the airport architecture experienced a boom, as was only encountered in our time.The form for the then new type of construction airport was worked from California Glendale to Iraqi Basra, from Stockholm to Madrid.
The old architectural dream of being able to put a personal stamp on design to an unused task became true here.Expanded predecessor solutions could be researched.But really visionary designs such as that of a hangar for airships and Aeroplane from Erich Mendelsohn stayed in the drawers.
A new type of construction of aviation from sports to the transport industry should have an effect on the airport buildings, which mostly stylistically resorted to the modern industrial architecture.The terminal, which the architects Paul and Klaus Engler built 1926 - 29 in Berlin, recalled a flat roof box with emphasized simple facades.The restaurant, which the Swiss architect Hans Wittwer designed for Halle-Leipzig Airport in 1929, has already continued:
In its luminous lightness of the fully glazed hall, the only load -bearing element, a number of five reinforced concrete supports, was demonstratively staged, completely obliged the ideas of the Bauhaus.In the style of the new objectivity, the Terminal of Dirk Roosenburg in Schiphol also came.Also built in 1929, the building captivated with one of the first control towers, which rose as the most striking symbol of aviation over the mandatory roof terrace, on the happiness of which an administrative wing, which was staggered by ninety degrees.
Unlike Hamburg Airport, all of these certificates from the airport architecture from the 1920s are destroyed today.In Hamburg, a terminal was created in 1928/29 according to the plans of Friedrich Dyrssen and Peter Averhoff, which Wolfgang Voigt judges as the most innovative of the twenties.In his work through this airport, the architectural historian has been able to disclose and show the qualities of the traffic construction how much influenced this successor to this successor in all of Europe.
But now the shadow of the demolition bulb on the facade of the old Airport Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel, which was still in operation until 1993, is becoming increasingly clear.With the demolition of the building, the architecture history of the 20th century is poorer for one of the last, but certainly the most important still existing testimony of early air traffic construction.Future -oriented
Functionality of the Hamburg airport building, a gently curved flat roof building with brick facade and graded terraces to the airfield, was one of the first of its kind.It generally set standards for the terminal architecture.Above all, the consistent separation of the different functions and their accommodation on their own floors were decisive.
The basement was intended for passion transport, while the ground floor with its counter hall was reserved for passengers.On the first floor there were the restaurant and the upstream viewing terrace, the airport administration offices on the second floor.The construction in the middle of the roof terrace was crowned by a glass viewing pulpit, which was visually extended down to a tower by a convex rounded glass window down to the second floor.
This layering of the functions was only to be maintained in practice through a cleverly created route.The combination of internal zoning of the functions and subtle arrangement of connecting channels guaranteed the trouble -free process.His real strength lies in this forward -looking system of construction.
Dyrssen & Averhoff presented the prototype of the terminal with him.In addition to functional, the route was also based on targeted social considerations, which can be seen from the side staircuts.The visitor to the airport came from the outside to the restaurant terrace and further up to the roof terrace, without ever crossing the path of a passenger.
The ramp, which divided the spectator gardens, came into the building from the roller field via a gently.Lateral stairs in the entrance to sorted out the non -traveler, so that the passengers in the switch hall remained.This solved the architects, which demanded that the tender demanded that the exclusivity of flying should remain preserved, but at the same time a large audience - 35,000 onlookers were expected to fly - a top -eye is offered.
New building instead of architectural monuments of this characteristic, the relatives of the Fuhlsbüttel Airport becomes clear to the hippodrome and carodrome.The sporting element of flying, the fascinating, flying as a mass attraction, reflected in the design in the form of the arena -like curved building moved to the airfield.A direct forerunner for Fuhlsbüttel can easily be seen in the Berlin clubhouse with grandstands, which was built in 1923 according to plans by Edmund Meurin.
Ernst Sagebiel 1936 - 39 in his Berlin -Tempelhof Airport 1936 - 39.The Fuhlsbütteler Terminal, which is future -oriented in functional questions, is the result of the interaction of several forces: the majority of the innovations go back to the competition advertisement:
Neither the ultimately victorious technology - airship, aircraft or flight boat were at disposition - nor about the growth rates were clear.What you knew was that flying was based on exclusivity despite its attractiveness for broad masses.The result was a highly efficient and flexible architecture, where society fell into sophisticated travelers and, as sports enthusiasts, labeled feasts.
In contrast, everyone should have fun at the glamor of the new Hamburg airport designed by the local office of Gerkan, Marg and Partner.The impressive roof structure is democratically swinging over all the headers: architecture as a stage for the traveler, in whose spotlight the service age of the nineties can sunbathe.
You would have hoped for innovation willingness to innovate with regard to the preservation of monuments.However, the competition was not informed about the competition, but with the freestyle of the first prize before the fact that, instead of the terminal of Dyrssen & Averhoff, one of the three new replacement halls would once rose instead of the terminated and extended.Efforts of the then head of the monument protection office, Manfred Fischer, together with the architects to develop a solution integrating the construction, remained unsuccessful.
The building would only have a chance, according to Fischer, if it could be used differently.But that is obviously not feasible at this point and at this point.However, the destruction of this architectural monument would no longer be averted.

Checking the wiring of the MD-11 / / Washington.-On Monday, the National Road Safety Authority of America (NTSB) recommended that the US Agricultural Agency FAA have to arrange inspections of all MD-11 aircraft in connection with the crash of the Swissair machine before Canada.
The NTSB was concerned about the recent discoveries of the Canadian investigation authorities in connection with the crash.A short circuit that has obviously occurred on board the accident machine was not yet proven to be the cause of a fire on the plane and no irregularities were discovered in the Swissair voluntary inspections, according to the NTSB.Nevertheless, the FAA should order that the cabling in the cockpits of the cockpits of all MD-11 are examined for loose cables and cable strands, scraped and damaged cable insulation as well as further damage.

MD-11: Suspicion confirms / / Washington.
The US Transport Security Authority (NTSB) has spoken out for checking the cabling in large-scale aircraft of the type MD-11.It recommended the US Air Force Authority (FAA) on Monday, in connection with the crash of a Swissair machine of this type in September last year before the east coast of Canada.All 229 inmates died in the crash.
NTSB is concerned about the recent discoveries of the Canadian authorities who examine the crash.Although a short circuit obviously occurred on board the accident machine, the cause of a fire on the plane has not yet been proven, and no irregularities had been discovered in the Swissair voluntary inspections, the faa said in the letter.Nevertheless, the FAA should order that the cabling in the cockpits of the cockpits of all MD-11 are examined for loose cables and cable strands, scraped and damaged cable insulation as well as further damage.
A FAA spokeswoman said that corresponding recommendations were expected soon.186 MD-11 aircraft are currently in operation worldwide, 65 of them in the United States.FAA arrangements are taken over worldwide.

All MD-11 are checked / / Washington / Halifax.After the crash of a Swissair machine in front of Halifax in September, the US authorities recommended that the MD-11 type aircraft be checked.
The head of the Canadian investigation commission, Vic Gerden, said on Monday (local time) in Halifax that during the checking of some of these machines, cockpits torn or brittle cables were discovered.According to the National Road Safety Authority in the USA (NTSB), all types of the type should now be checked for possible cable damage.When the MD-11 machine crashed, all 229 inmates died.
Gergen pointed out that traces of overheating of electrical lines were also found in the wreck of the crashed Swissair aircraft.However, the exact cause of the accident is still unclear.The investigations are far from complete, said Gerden.

In practically all business areas, the group will massively miss the profit budgeted for the 1998 financial year.At the airlined subsidiary Swissair, the ERGRAG is in front of interest and taxes below the budget by more than fifty percent.It is not much different with the commercial companies.
Only the aircraft rental company Flightlease and the crossair effortlessly meet the planned guidelines.According to the official reading, falling income as a result of the increasing competition and the Asian crisis are to blame for the debacle.However, this is only half the truth.
First, the crisis mainly affects inner -Asian traffic - the Swiss are not committed there.Second, the market continues to grow, only slower than before.The Civil Affairs Association IATA expects an annual growth of at least 4.4 percent (instead of 7.7 percent, as predicted before).
Thirdly, the crisis mainly affects financially weak companies.The Filipino Airline Pal is already bankrupt, Garuda (Indonesia), Malaysian, Asiana (Korea), Korean Airlines and others are close to the abyss.In contrast, stable financed airlines like most European are still strong in business, yes, yes, they sometimes even benefit from the misery of the weaker.
The repressed other half of the truth is called: the Swissair still produces too expensive.Her boss Jeffrey Katz has not managed the gymound that has been overdue for years.
This is devastating in an increasingly free market, because here the cheapest providers determine the tariff.KLM, which has been successfully reducing costs for years, can afford to fly from Switzerland for CHF 840 to Japan and back;For the Swissair, this would only be possible with loss.
She only demands 496 francs for the cheapest flight to Brussels?Flight tariffs will soon be even deeper. The prospects that something quickly changes.A new personnel reduction would inevitably lead to a quality of quality and thus further weaken the market position.
Renewal wage cuts would probably trigger uprisings in the staff and are therefore hardly up for discussion, especially since Katz's position in the company is no longer unchallenged anyway.Some insiders already openly count on its early departure.And with the integration of Switzerland that has now become possible into the European Economic Area, not only the business opportunities for the Swissair, but as well as the possibilities of cheaper EU competitors, in their hunting grounds.
Swiss monopoly routes and their partners like those to Brussels and Vienna are likely to be the first destinations.Switzerland, which is still above average today, will inevitably slip.For the management of the Sair Group, this development is surprising to the extent, but not in that direction.
For years, its boss Philippe Bruggisser has been focusing on buying up potential competitors or binding them to enlarge the market base.So far, however, the invoice has not worked.The European qualifier group listed by the Swissair mainly consists of either renovation cases or politically uncertain partners.
Austrian Airlines (along with their daughters Lauda Air and Tyrolean), Turkish Airlines and Air Portugal do not feel comfortable in the alliance.It would not be surprising if one or the other of these names soon disappeared from the qualifier logo.Air Littoral (France) is miserable - because of the lack of pilot, she had to stand still several planes - and does not bring any synergies.
The Belgian Sabena fights with high costs and relentless unions.In the charter area, the German LTU is a valuable acquisition, but is currently also a loss loan;The same applies to the Belgian Sobelair and the two Italian charter airlines Air Europe and Volare, which also currently require high investments.
Remains the French AOM.To the outside, she is a full partner in the qualifier group.As a local governor, she will soon take over the sale of Swissair in France.
In fact, however, it is not yet certain whether the Swissair can ever control the company and, if so, at what price.The company belongs to the bankruptcy of the Crédit Lyonnais and is currently being auctioned.In addition to the Swiss, British Airways, KLM and Lufthansa also offer vigorously.
So there is a double danger: Swissair can lose the fight and will then be forced to re -establish itself in the important French market with huge effort.Or it offers to the bitter end and pays too much.
That would be in advance in the interest of the German Lufthansa, which still cooperates with the Air Littoral.If this occurs, that would not be the first time: According to insiders, the Sair Group paid too much for the British Duty-Freee company's survivors in 1996 after British Airways had driven up the price with exactly this intention.
The imponderables abandoned - and yet Bruggisser fully relies on qualifier, fully at risk.This year, the brand is to be formally launched as such, with an effort of a hundred million francs?The game of the Sair Group is also risky from a different aspect.
The Air France and the American Delta, the latter, will still announce a close partnership as part of the “Atlantic Excellence”.If the deal comes about, the Swissair is significantly weakened in the survival-important North America market.It would then be forced to find a new partner under high time pressure - and thus in a position of the weakness.
It is clear who it will be: American Airlines (AA), because negotiations with the former employer of Jeffrey Katz are already unofficially underway.However, this would mean that the Swissair also riveted British Airways in the area of sphere of influence-exactly the airline that has been aiming for a partnership with the Swiss for years, but has always been rejected by them because the Swissair managers (And especially Bruggisser) did not want to play the second violin.Sooner or later, the qualifier alliance would probably break apart during this constellation.
Because her actual purpose is to establish the Swissair as a leader of a group of rather weak airlines.Loss of independence?Delta's generally expected decision for going together with the Air France could show far -reaching strategic consequences for the Swissair.
In extreme cases, even the loss of independence threatens.Because the “OneWorld” alliance that arises around British Airways and AA - also Iberia, Aerolineas Argentinas, Canadian Airlines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Air Liberté, German BA and others - needs a strong basis inCentral Europe.After all, Germany and Scandinavia are largely occupied by the “Star” alliance (Lufthansa, SAS, United and others), Holland and Italy by a group with KLM / Alitalia / Northwest.
Switzerland could be the basis for Central Europe if it actually opens up to Europe.It is clear that the Swissair in the “OneWorld” group would be comparatively a lightweight and not the number one as today in the qualifier club.As the sole shareholder of the Swissair, the Sair would be able to contribute the airline to a connection either through stock sales or other forms of irrevocable cooperation, which it de facto deprived of its entrepreneurial independence.
Philippe Bruggisser can go through such things without emotion if he is convinced of its correctness.It is clear that the name and legal status of the company would remain in Switzerland, otherwise the traffic rights for most long -haul routes would be endangered.A swissair that is remotely controlled by London or Dallas does not need to be a brain clamping forever.
It would also not be a national catastrophe.Finally, a different sanctuary of our country, the Toblerone, has been the product of an American company for years, without the nation having been recognizable.Even the Swiss Jass cards will soon come from Belgium?
Image: New alliances in air traffic: In extreme cases, Swissair threatens a loss of the self-employment brand with space-faithful stones “Killer-Brand” is the Swissair, its boss Jeffrey Katz nurse.In German: an unbeatable top brand.
According to his vision, it should be the basis for the company's success.How exactly this is meant can be observed on the Swissair flights to Venice and Bologna since the beginning of December.There is no longer a Saab 2000 of the sister company Crossair, but a British Aerospace Bae-146, which is characterized as a “Swissair Express”, that belongs to the American US airways and as part of a so-called franchise surgery from the British Discount Airline Debonair on behalfthe Italian Air One is operated.
Nothing against this plane;It is the predecessor of the jumbolino, which is also used by the Crossair, somewhat (14 years old and was parked in the desert for several years due to non -use), but was technically reliable.It is more astonishing that the plane is written to with the “elite name” (Katz) of the Swissair.
Because his passenger seats are arranged in six rows and the closest width: exactly 41.9 centimeters wide;That is still 4.1 centimeters less than in the Crossair aircraft, which is used as "too little customer-friendly".Most continental European Bae -146 - like the jumbolinos of the crossair - have only five seats per row.
This applies even to those five jets that operates the same debonair as part of another franchise contract for Lufthansa.Officially, however, it sounds very different from Swissair.Original sound by franchising boss Mark Ellinger: «Swissair Express should be as good as the original.
It is about expanding the brand without causing its damage.We don't try to take the public around the nose. »What then?Does Katz want to kill his “killer brandy”?

Approaching corporate goals for the airport / / Zurich Airport Kloten should secure its position as an international traffic hub in the competition of European airports with a customer -oriented offer and thus strengthen the Swiss economics.The Airport company also wants to work internationally.
The new strategy was presented on Thursday by Josef Felder, the designated head of the future airport company.While the Preliminary Commission of the Cantonal Council advises on the government councilor's template for the independence of the Zurich Airport Kloten, the new operational head of the airport real estate company (FIG) and designed future head of the airport, Josef Felder, deals intensively with the future perspectives of the airportZurich .As Felder said after ten weeks of active activity in his new function in the context of a media breakfast on Thursday, Zurich has the last dependent state airport in Europe and has fallen back in the "ranking".
The new FIG boss described the starting point for the way to the future as not necessarily optimal.The competition among Europe's airports is carried out with all hardness, whereby the position of the large hubs (traffic hits) Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London and Paris can be described as secure while Kloten has to fight the connection.In order to secure the livelihood of the hub function in Kloten, which is of great importance for the economy of our country, the step from monopoly thinking must be carried out for orientation towards the laws of the market economy.
According to Felder's vision, Zurich Airport should develop into a worldwide leading and successful company, not least from the realization that the development opportunities of the Sairgroup must be secured with a well -functioning home airport, all the more than the intended bilateral agreement with the EU ofSwissair opens new possibilities.More sales and more jobs for the Association of FIG and Airport Directorate Zurich, the sales of around CHF 450 million should be increased from CHF 1 billion to CHF 1 to 2003 and the profit from CHF 50 to CHF 150 million, the number of jobs is increasedshould increase from 1000 to 1500.
This is sought with a two -part strategy.First of all, Zurich Kloten should experience a strong qualitative upgrading as part of the 5th stage of the construction, and the range of services in the non-viatic sector is also to be significantly increased, for example with the settlement of large distributors, hotels and leisure activities such as cinemas, fitness and wellness centers.In the cultural area, fields thinks of exhibitions and concerts.
In the actual airport area, he is considering starting the handling business.With a privatized airport, Felder also wants to use the extensive knowledge acquired under difficult external conditions abroad, whereby he granted the previous management authorities to torment top services that Zurich Kloten secured a leading role in the areas of flight operations, environment and security.These experiences are in demand worldwide today.
However, the prerequisite for a profitable marketing is entrepreneurial freedom.Fields sees uses in planning, construction, expansion and operation of new or existing airports, but it also thinks of investments and alliances.Creating trust is a great concern to Josef Felder to create a solid base of trust, which is particularly important in the airport neighborhood.
He therefore already explained his ideas on Wednesday evening on the agricultural elegations of the airport communities;His openness was welcomed, his explanations came across critical attention as well as a clear rejection.Fields did not want to comment on the current political situation.

Sidestep approach procedures should definitely be / / With regard to the southern German neighborhood, Zurich Airport has been tested a new approach procedure during a year, which is now to be introduced - although a positive appreciation of the measure from the German side has failed to materialize.The airport directorate wants to introduce the so-called Sidestep procedure for the approach to slope 14, which was tested in a one-year test phase, and will definitely introduce the corresponding permit to the Federal Office of Civil Affairs, as the government council in response to a request from cantonal councilor Thomas Büchi (GP.
The procedure with the side step consists of a hint by means of an instrument landing system (ILS) on the axis and the sliding path of the slope of the slope 16 to 9 km before its upturn point, a clearly defined visual flight section with a right curve and subsequent left curve on the axis of the slopes 14, as well asa 4.5 km long, straight final approach.Agreement with Germany as the government council, which has been explained in its answer, is stated in an administrative agreement between the German Federal Ministry of Transport and the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Aviation from 1984 that the approaches from the north should be distributed to the two landing slopes;This means that two thirds of the southern German territory should take place on the axle of flight 14 and one third on the axis of flight 16.
The main reason for this agreement was a more balanced distribution of the approach noise on the two slopes.It is of great importance for the airport holder that the obligation received by the federal government can be observed as far as possible, as the government council writes.The sidestep procedure is currently the only procedure that allows you to achieve this without impairing flight operations in an inadmissible way.
Both for the SwissControl as well as the Swissair and the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, the procedure is easily feasible and absolutely secure if used correctly.More negative than positive reactions.
the measurement results within limits;Therefore, the airport directorate intends to definitely introduce the sidestep process, although the statements received in the consultation carried out were majority.A total of twelve affected cities and municipalities as well as the protection association of the population around Zurich Airport and the cantonal aircraft noise commission were included in the consultation.
The majority spoke out against the definitive introduction of this procedure.The statements of Bülach, Oberglatt, Niederglatt, Hüntwangen, Kaiserstuhl and the cantonal aircraft noise commission have been positive or neutral.The communities mentioned show understanding because they are little or no affected or, as in the case of Kaiserstuhl, are even relieved.
In terms of the matter, the Stadel and Weiach would also have to find a noticeable relief.However, these two communities formally refrain from comment.The cantonal aircraft noise commission states that the new process does not increase the noise pollution overall, but will change in the area.
After weighing up the advantages and disadvantages, you appear to be justifiable.The representative of the Waldshut district does not follow this opinion for principle.The procedure is rejected by Wasterkingen, Zweidlen, Glattfelden, Höri, Hochfelden, Neerach, the Protection Association and the Waldshut district with the communities in the approach area.
Wasterers and Zweidlen are both almost below, Glattfelden near the piste 16 approach and therefore have increased immissions, albeit with a relatively low sound level at a low level.It is understandable for the government council that these communities are against the sidestep procedure.Hochfelden, Neerach and Höri are below the curve part of the flight.
This means that the perception of the outdoor areas is different from the case of a normal approach to the slopes and the question of the security of the procedure is asked.In terms of content, rejection of German Seeper Schlagenverband does not take a position on the accompanied project because he wants an overall show of all intended, noise-relevant changes to arrival and departure procedures.The Waldshut district office and the German communities represent the clearly refutable view that the SIDESTEP procedure would not meet the agreement and therefore reject.

High-flying plans in Zurich / / Zurich clot Airport wants to expand rapidly after the planned independence.The designated director of the future airport company, Josef Felder, is aiming for worldwide alliances and participations in foreign airports. "We want and must have doubled sales within three years, otherwise we run the risk of losing our independence," said Felder on Thursdayin Zurich .
Felder wants to grow with international cooperation and with the expansion of the airport into a turnstile in intercontinental traffic (hub) and to a service and entertainment center.He sees opportunities for alliances and selective cooperation with the airports of Brussels, Vienna, Copenhagen, Munich and Milan.Fields on the capital market want to procure the money for any investments.
Fields wants to sell smaller and new airports traffic, security and environmental technology.Felder assumes that Europe will still have five airport groups in ten years, each of which has several airports.Today it must be decided whether Zurich wanted to count among the corporations.
The airport faces the same decision as the Swissair a few years ago when it built up the qualifier alliance and thus brought herself to the first airline league.Doubting sales of the Swiss airports.
Realistically, Switzerland only stands one hub.Today the airport is operated by the Cantonal Administrative Department Airport Directorate (FDZ) and the mixed economy Fluhafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft (FIG).The two structures are to be merged and organized privately this year.
Both organizations generated sales of around CHF 450 million in 1998.Until 2003, Felder expects an increase to CHF 1 billion and a leap in profits from 50 to around CHF 150 million.The number of airport workstations is expected to increase from 1000 to 1500, said Felder.

Fig Zurich plans to take off under fields / / targeted expansion to the extent decided to bring the merger with the cantonal management
Fig a lot of imagination.When the Zurich government announced that it wanted to merging Airport Immobiliengesellschaft AG (FIG) with the Zurich Airport Directorate (FDZ), the course of the FIG share skyrocketed.
This week, Josef Felder, new director of the FIG and designated head of the future airport company, has oriented it with a lot of charm about his plans.The decided 5th expansion stage, which is financed by the canton of Zurich, such as the fusion of FGI and FDZ lay the basis to make the largest Swiss airport a powerful hub within Europe.Cooperations with other middle airports such as Vienna, Copenhagen or Munich could be a way.
Fields hopes more traffic - and thus opportunities for expanding the range of services.After all, “Kloten” is not only an international airport, but also a city with 20,000 jobs.Without state bonds, know-how could also be exported into operation, maintenance or security.
If the new, unbureaucratic thinking succeeds, a new withdrawal of the FIG share - highly valued today - is conceivable.However, Felder's visions do not yet convince all regional decision -makers.It is even more important that Swissair remains loyal to Zurich's home airport.

Space station: Send Swiss to “Pharaoh” to All / / Zurich - high -precision atomic clocks, new measuring devices, special robots: Swiss scientists are involved in the international space station ISS.
For example, the physical -meteorological observatory in Davos: It developed Sovim (Solar Variability and Irradiance Monitor) - a device for the exact measurement of solar energy on board the space station.Observatory director Claus Fröhlich, one of the gurus of Swiss space research: "With the help of our radiation measuring apparatus, we will be able to study solar radiation with far greater accuracy than before." Expert Fröhlich and his team hope with your high-precision measuring device, a three-Mio-projectto be able to snatch the last secrets to the sun:
"It is extremely important to know how the energy flow of the sun changes over time because this also has a very concrete impact on our earth's climate." Another ISS project is the alpha magnet spectrometer of the Geneva Professor Maurice BourquinAnd the Nobel Prize winner Samuel Ting: There should be information about where the mysterious antimatter is hidden exactly in the depths of space. "Biopack" is called another research project.Professor Augusto Cogoli from ETH Zurich is involved in him.
Biopack is intended to provide the scientists important insights into life processes in space.Another millions of experiment, which Swiss scientists are on board on board, is the use of a new generation of nuclear clocks.A model for space called “Pharao” was tested on parabolic airways by aircraft.
Giovanni Busca from the Cantonal Observatory in Neuchâtel in the Swiss research magazine “Horizonte”: “Our new hydrogen atom clock is highly precise and - since it is intended for use in space - also very easy.It weighs only around 35 kilos. »The Oerlikon-Contraves company, in turn, designs the formwork of a new vehicle.

In 1998, despite Halifax, there was no disaster year / / a total of 1244 people in 1998 in aircraft accidents, less than in previous years.Despite the crash of the MD-11 Swissair on September 2 at Halifax, in 1998 there was no disaster year for flying.
With 48 accidents worldwide, 1244 people were killed.Despite the air traffic, which was significantly increased worldwide, this number is below the average of the past ten years.1801 people died in 1985, and in 1996 there were 1840 deaths in 57 accidents.
Every year, over 1.6 billion people are promoted in world air traffic by more than 11,000 commercial aircraft at approximately 20 million starts.Despite the Swissair disaster with 229 deaths, an old finding was also confirmed in 1998: The third world and many old aircraft from Eastern Europe are disproportionately represented on this repeatedly bitter annual balance.
Although most accidents between heaven and earth have several causes - rarely one reason alone leads to crash - there are focal points.Man is the weakest member: 30 of the 48 accidents in the past year are also due to pilot errors, according to previous knowledge.13 crashes were registered as CFIT accidents.

Those who travel properly save time / / time is money, especially for the business tripller, who tries today in London and tomorrow in Berlin to bring their business to a successful degree.Various, sometimes little -known services that are offered around the flying are based on this principle.
The business trip on the plane usually begins with the transfer to the airport.Anyone who does not climb the train to Zurich airport in Zurich, but preferred to travel with their own car, has benefited from the Valet Parking Service since last summer.Once at the airport, the signaling departure / Car Rental Return is followed on the ramp of the departure level, whereby one sticks to the right -wing trace for taxis and buses.
The car is finally parked on the left side of this lane and the vehicle key is handed over to the opposite Valet Parking switch, right next to the entrance to Terminal A.Back in Zurich, the car keys are handed over to the same place, and the car is ready to be picked up in the parking garage A. The vehicle is parked for an additional charge at the time of return before the terminal A;
On request, the car is cleaned and serviced.Valet Parking not only eliminates the often tedious search for parking space, but also shortens the way to the departure hall.
The service was originally initiated by Europcar, Swissair and BTI Kuoni and has existed at the EuroAirport Basel-Multhouse-Freiburg since the spring of 1998. According to the Europcar-Switzerland manager Carlos Sardinha, discussions with the Geneva airport are currently running to introduce Valet Parking at Cointrin Airport.Valet
Parking is open to everyone interested 365 days a year from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. 30.Additional information and tariffs can be called up on the Internet (www.europcar.ch).Check in
Easy for acceleration of the check-in procedure, there are various options to choose from.The electronic check-in, which is feasible with all tickets that have a magnetic strip, turns out to be well established.At Zurich airport, more modern devices have recently been installed for passengers without luggage and also placed in the terminal in the terminal areas.
According to Sandra Karl-Wälchli (Swissair communication), an additional machine will be set up again in the next few weeks per check-in area.And where the former express check-in took place, the range of machines will soon increase from four to six devices.In addition, express check-in switches for travelers without luggage are available.
The situation for Swissair-First and Business Class passengers as well as for the Travel Club members who have a smart pass and also travel without luggage is even more comfortable.The classic check-in is eliminated because the desired seat is already reserved when booking.The passengers receive their boarding pass in advance and can find themselves directly on the gate up to 15 minutes before departure.
Anyone who travels with luggage and can belong to the above -mentioned passenger segment will handle the handling procedure by phone.In Zurich, the check-in can be done on phone (01) 812 26 00 from 24 hours before departure.The board card is then available at the airport (for example at the Swissair Welcome Desk).
The luggage can be handed in at the same place.In Geneva, Telephone (022) 799 38 36, and Basel, Telephone (061) 325 23 36, there is an identical offer.Ticketless
Flying the future, however, means a ticket -free flying.Lufthansa has been offering the so -called ETIX since the end of 1996.According to press spokeswoman Monika Göbel, the electronic ticket is used in the meantime of over 40 percent of passengers.
With Lufthansa, as of January 1999, fleeing can also be flown after 42 international destinations.The only prerequisite for ETIX is a credit card or a customer card (Miles & More).When booking in the travel agency, on the phone or on the Internet, the corresponding card number is simply specified.
The ticket is stored in the Lufthansa computer system in connection with the card number, and passengers at the machine or check-in switch with their credit or customer card at the airport.Another advantage of the paperless ticket: bookings can be made until shortly before departure.According to Swissair, the ticket -free flying in Germany is expected to be a current topic this summer.
The first tests are to be carried out from the end of March 1999.Back to the present, back to conventional check-in offers.By train to flight still offers numerous advantages.
In the meantime, 23 train stations all over Switzerland offer the opportunity to handle check-in for CHF 20.The luggage can be abandoned at another 116 train stations (Fly & Rail).However, the check-in formalities have not yet been done.
Lounge service travelers who appear at the airport at an early stage or are faced with delays can take advantage of the special lounges.In Zurich Kloten there is, for example, the Business Class Lounge, which has Reuters terminal, laptop connections, email access or telephone and fax services.And if you end up in Zurich after a long flight, you will advise a stopover in the Arrival Lounge (arrival area Terminal A) before the next meeting or return to the office.
The offer: showering, relaxation rooms, description with telephone, fax and laptop connections as well as snacks and drinks.First and business class passengers enjoy free access here;Economy-class passengers pay 30 francs. «Time Saving Menues» and SMS travelers in one of the two front classes can shorten the meal time by means of a special «Time Saving Menues» and their hunger instead of in several courses simply with a pre-ordered meal, which in one roundis served, breastfeed.
Laptop connections will soon be in all three classes in Swissair, the CNN News will provide information about the world events on long-haul flights, and the wife or secretary greets on the go with a bouquet of flowers or another present from the "Shopping on Board"-Offer .On the other hand, the newly offered Flight Irregularity Broadcasting Service from Swissair should be far more useful in daily life: Anyone who specifies the Natel number when booking will be informed about any delays of their flight directly by SMS (initially only for first and first andBusiness Class and Club members).In addition, the Swissair flight schedule from the Internet (www.swissair.com) has been downloaded to your own computer for around three months.

A straw for the Swiss World Airways / / ww.Geneva, 21.
Januardie Arranged Young Geneva Airfage Swiss World Airways (SWA), which is in the consent of a default, carried out an extraordinary general assembly on Thursday at the instigation of a group of shareholders.This group is a community of interests that was Hani Yamani, a son of Sheikh Yamani, the former oil minister of Saudi Arabia, and designed a plan to revive the SWA.This is probably the only serious attempt to extend the SWA, which has so far been very short, barely two -month “operational life”.
The shareholders approved a proposal initiated by Yamani to undergo the past and the accounting books of a special reveal in order to find out the truth about the mistakes and the actual financial situation.This examination is first paid for by Yamani and at most burdened the airline later if it continues to exist.At the same time, the currently present sketch of a plan to revive the SWA is specified and refined.
The approximately two and a half hour shareholder meeting brought some basic knowledge about the SWA and its environment.First of all, the estate was obviously granted on a very poor basis, perhaps even on an insufficient basis for political reasons.Second, the Geneva Airport uses significant forces in order to be able to form its own traffic hub with a local airline.

"Mobility is freedom" / / G. S. A more plastic introduction to his lecture, Dr.H.c.Horst Teltschik, member of the board of BMW AG, cannot wish for his lecture from Tuesday at the Swiss Institio for foreign research.
His topic was "possibilities and limits of mobility".And since his plane had to avoid fog to Basel, the speaker only arrived at the University of Zurich.Despite this monitored pitfalls of technology, Teltschik, which was experienced firsthand, into overall optimism and ultimately saw no convincing alternative to the car.
At the same time, however, he made it clear that the auto industry is very thinking about integrated traffic concepts and not one -sidedly only forced its own product. «Stauzen” of 200 billion dollar dentors, who had been a personal employee of Chancellor Kohl for many years before starting BMW, initially emphasized that it initially emphasized thathow much mobility is a characteristic of a free society.It is not for nothing that the withdrawal of freedom, taking away mobility, is one of the toughest punishments in all companies.Mobility is a basic need for humans that it is economically necessary and not a wish created by the car producers.
In addition, mobility or a good transport infrastructure is one of the most important location factors in worldwide competition.The traffic sector also accounts for around 20 % of gross value added in Germany and provides around 5 million jobs.However, the downside of this medal - traffic disabilities, transport sales and environmental damage - did not fail to do so.
According to the BMW calculations in Germany, the “Stauben” alone amounts to around DM 200 billion per year.Here the traffic infarction threatens.The speaker was less dedicated to the environmental impact.
Since the estimates of the external costs of road traffic for Germany fluctuated between 21.5 billion and 222 billion DM, these could not form a basis for a responsible transport policy.This must cope with a delicate ridge.On the one hand, it is about having as much traffic as necessary to secure prosperity and employment, but on the other side about only allowing as much traffic as possible to burden too much without the environment and infrastructure.
Avoid, relocate, tolerated Machenteltschik called three solutions.Firstly, under the motto "avoid traffic"
Economic and traffic growth are increasingly decoupled.To do this, the transport systems would have to be rationalized, from market -based parking fees in city centers to the better linking of private and public transport to the use of telematics.Second, traffic must be shifted, which requires real alternatives.
Since today neither the railway nor public transport offer such an alternative, investments in the transport infrastructure and not, as the populist demand often sound, it is needed to shorten the street space or mobility disabilities.The most examples listed Teltschik, third, to the compatible design of traffic.They range from the reduction in consumption - between 1978 and 1985 the fleet consumption fell by 22.7 %, between 1990 and 2005 it is to fall again by 25 % (for newly approved cars) - driven to exertion to CO2 reduction and alternatives.
It is often evident that the efforts of industry alone are not sufficient.In the judgment of the BMW manager, the elimination of infrastructure bottlenecks is necessary, one does not want to destroy the technical savings success.And for the success of environmentally friendly fuel, as BMW wants to have developed together with other companies until the end of 1999, the corresponding framework conditions and then a sufficient supply infrastructure are needed.
In view of the globality of many environmental problems, Teltschik was also committed to using western traffic know-how for the creation of sustainable infrastructures in the Third World, since the border costs of further consumption reductions are much lower than in the industrialized countries.Intelligent networking welfare of the speaker repeatedly advocated eliminating bottlenecks and increasing capacities - such as third lane on the motorways - the focus of his explanations was on the concerns of intelligent networking of a wide variety of means of transport.For this integrated traffic management, the cooperation of everyone is needed - also across borders.

The Swissair crash in the dispute of the media / / u. Sd.Washington, January 22nd "Wall Street Journal" ("WSJ") published another report on the crash of Swissair 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia and cited from a preliminary report that the Canadian investigation authorities created for the government.
The report is confidential, and therefore it was not commented on by the responsible bodies.According to “WSJ”, the Canadian traffic safety authority (TSB) found that there was an examination of the appropriate approach between the pilot Urs Zimmermann and co-pilot Stefan Löw, who flew the MD-11 after the first problems appeared.While Löw apparently pleaded several times in view of the smoke development to land as quickly as possible and to lead the plane into a steep descent, Zimmermann has rejected or ignored the suggestions of his co-pilot.
However, there can be no question of a bitter dispute over the right procedure.Controversial sinking speed man was obviously leafing through the checklist during the intensification of the crisis and was not always acceptable, the WSJ writes.However, he had instructed Löw not to "sink too quickly", whereupon he withdrawn from 4000 to 3100 feet per minute.
Löw seemed to alert this.According to the report, he is said to have told the pilot that he believes that the machine sinks as quickly as possible in order to enable landing in the cockpit even with dense smoke.When asked Löw's question, whether he thinks it is right to drain flight petrol, Zimmermann did not clearly react;
The “WSJ” suspects that the pilot wanted to postpone this decision.Later, when Löw flew a left-wing curve to let go of kerosene over the sea, Zimmermann is said to have acknowledged the question of the co-pilot whether he could fly more slowly with the remark that he does not want to be disturbed now.Apparently the pilot was still desperately looking for indications in the checklist.
A little later, the situation escalated dramatically.The pilots sent out the well -known emergency call;Then the contact with the floor station broke off and the technical devices on board failed.
If the "WSJ" cites a confidential report and thus further awesome the extremely delicate debate about the causes, indeed the "guilt" of the accident, two must be taken into account.On the one hand, the printing of confidential or secret material has long since mutated into a virtue in the American press.Lecks and the disregard for confidentiality regulations are more common than in Europe, and many journalists feel it as a quality feature if they break the law in the fight for the misunderstood “rights of the reader”.
On the other hand, it is an advantage for all those who complain about the Swissair because of the crash if they can prove inconsistencies or misconduct in the cockpit and do not only have to rely on technical defects - which obviously existed.This is known to the “WSJ”.Hesitant
All of this is usually forgotten that there is simply no question of clear “errors” in this situation.Nobody knows what would have happened if the plane had been forced into a steep descent in retrospect.It is possible, but not safe that such an improvisation would have been successful.
The opposite is also conceivable: that the machine would have crashed as a result of maneuvers that should have been due to the reasonable.Imagine the following scenario: Pilot Zimmermann - mind you, contrary to the provisions of the checklist - would have arranged an extreme descent and the machine would have crashed.
Then it was now called - because afterwards you are always wiser - that it would have been indicated to take off fuel in accordance with the provisions and only then risk the landing approach.Zimmermann, who fought for his life in the cockpit as well as Löw, to be explained in retrospect as a "guilty", is not only too good: it is dishonestly dishonest.

Misleading Swissair speculation from America / / CJA.Ottawa, January 24 With the investigation of the crash of Swissair 111 in front of the Canadian east coast, Safety Board of Canada (TSB), entrusted to the “Wall Street Journal”, has the latest “revelations” published by an alleged confidential preliminary report by the TSB as “misleading speculation" designated .
As the head of the TSB examination team, Vic Gerden, stated at a press conference, he was not aware of which document was based on the report of the Wall Street Journal.The interpretations of the cockpit talks given by the American sheet - including the reports of an alleged discussion between the pilot Urs Zimmermann and co -pilot Stefan Löw for the appropriate procedure - are "misleading, incorrect and unfair".It was a wrong representation ("Misaracterization") of the actual event, emphasized Gerden.
Although the global publication of all cockpit talks under Canadian law is not permitted, the head of the investigation team of the traffic safety authority said that all available data confirmed the professional and corrupt behavior of the Swiss pilots.According to VIC Gerden, the apostrophized misleading speculation is only unnecessary stress for the relatives of the pilots and all other victims.In this context, Gerden mentioned as a further example
The rumor, which had been put into circulation months ago, that the pilots should have left the cockpit as a result of the unbearable heat before the MD-11 machine crashed.However, the evaluation of the material parts recovered so far has shown that Stefan Löw was in his seat during the crash, since his seat belt and the associated buckle have clear distortions.The remains required for the examination have not yet been found from the Pilot's Seat of Zimmermann.

"Airliner" drives from Belper Bahnhof to the airport / / from Monday the "airliner".The bus will connect the airport to Belp station.
The Belpmoos can connect to public transport.The line is operated by the BLS.· Christine Nydeggerschon On Monday the time has come:
The “airliner” will drive back and forth between the Belp station and the airport.The bus produces the connections to the S-Bahn.This enables the airport directly from a public transport.
To this day, the Taxi Airport runs from Blaser and Co between Bern station and the airport.The new bus will drive once every hour from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the week from 6 a.m. to evening.In the peak times in the morning, over lunch and in the evening every half hour.
Not only Passengereda's new offer should not only address flight passengers, in terms of a message from the canton.Walkers, airport visitors and the guests of the Belper Badi are also called target groups.The bus also enables the Neumatt district to be opened up.
The journey with the “Airliner” will be included in the general subscription, in BärenaBi (Zone 31) and in the train films on the package arrangements for tourists.A vouch for a train station airport will cost three francs without a half-tax subscription.
The canton has given the BLS Lötschbergbahn AG the order, the bus is operated by the Belper local bus company.Competition for taxi-dieters Elsener, the co-owner of the airport taxis Blaser and Co, wants to wait and see."We could lose customers," he says.
All of the GA owners will consider the train ride to the Gürbetal and the change in Belp, he believes.The trump card of the airport taxis remains the direct connection with the train station in the city of Bern."Above all, we have customers who pick up from the airfield and chauffeure directly into the city," explains Elsener.
The airport taxi will continue to be available after every landing.Anyone who ends up in Belp in the near future will have the selection between two driving options: with the “Airliner” to the Belp train station or with the Blaser and Co airport taxi to Bern.0000 ·

In the snow, everyone is the same / / the violent snowfall in Davos showed how susceptible to general top events are.Andy Bantel "We are in Davos for the 29th time," says World Economic Forum President Klaus Schwab, "but we have never had so much snow.»
In fact, the 40 centimeters of fresh snow, which just fell over the Alps at the beginning of the global economic summit, have given the organizers and participants with some problems.The German Federal President Roman Herzog expressed the difficulties of his journey at the beginning of his speech in a bon mot: «Very revered Mr. Schwab, they said in their greeting that they were happy that I came to Davos.
In fact, I almost didn't come here.“The hall acknowledged Herzog's statement with a laugh.The opening ceremony had previously started only half an hour after the scheduled start due to its delay.
Vehicle instead of helicoptera, the American Vice Al Gore had to accept activities because of the weather: Four heavy helicopters were probably ready at Zurich-Kloten Airport, but because of the wild snow, the American politician had to travel to deeply cut by a hurried vehicle caravan.Since his speech was only on the program on Friday, he had enough time.
Only with chain skewed numerous other guests of Davos got to know the unbill in nature: Those who traveled by car were forced to assemble chains by the Graubünden police in Kloster.At 30 kilometers per hour it continued to Davos.
The Landquart-Davos route, otherwise a matter of three quarters of hours, took about two hours of driving.The snowfall was a routine matter for the Davos itself: the snow masses pushed aside dozens of excavators from tons.
And although it slightly continued at night, the Davos streets almost presented themselves in normal state on Friday morning.A weak consolation for Roman Herzog.1419 · Image Reuterschlich

A remarkable "non -event" / / met.In a statistically remarkable fact, the Washington Post and the "International Herald Tribune" make aware: Last year, on board an American commercial aircraft - Commuters included - not a single passenger in line traffic.
Since 1967, since the National Transportation Safety Board has had the statistics, this has never happened before.The figures behind this message are impressive and they represent almost half of World Airus traffic: in 1998 aircraft transported 615 million passengers on an average of 640 kilometers on an average of 14 million flights.Not a single accident in the American air traffic industry throughout a year is an extreme value - but it is in the statistical trend.
In 1997, too, only two people died on board aircraft of the larger US airlines;There were also five accidents in feeder transport.And since July 17, 1997, the puzzling catastrophe ahead of Long Island (TWA 800), no airline has been affected by an accident in America.
In 1978, when President Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act, completely different: the airlines would save in material maintenance and the formation of the crews that flying must be less uncertain.The opposite has occurred.
And the tariffs have dropped by a third;The Washington Post is calculating that today the American passengers save $ 12.4 billion a year.In 1980 in the United States the probability of losing life during an airplane accident was 1.3 per million departures;
Today the value is 0.5.The American air traffic system, according to the report, appears chaotic, but it worked incredibly efficiently: in 1994 there were five deaths per passenger miles covered in the plane, while 4100 deaths were complained about on the equivalent route in road traffic.

A personality has died to Hedwig Brack / / with Hedwig Brack, whose life and work was very closely associated with Swiss traffic air ride.Growing up in Lenzburg, she took up a job as a secretary of the famous director and flight pioneer Walter Mittelholzer at the Zurich Air Society AD Astra-Aero AG at the end of 1929.
As she writes: «...As an accountant with a focus on girls for everything.»
So soon she was a manuscript secretary for Mittelholzer's book “Kilimanjaro flight”.In 1931 the merger of the AD Astra with Basler Luftverkehrs AG Balair zum Swissair followed, with Hedwig Brack in the function of a so -called fusion accountant.At the first major air disaster in European air traffic, the crash of the Swissair aircraft Curtiss “Condor” near Tuttlingen on July 27, 1934, Hedwig Brack's life comrade was one of the victims.
In pain and despair, she concentrated on her further training and in the spring of 1935 she was the first woman to pass the federal accountant diploma exam.Hedwig Brack was now head of the Swissair's entire accounting.The Second World War followed, where it was mainly to "keep the fortress" with a greatly reduced staff.
Hedwig Brack received the signature authorization and finally the procuration.The bookkeeping department developed into a finance department, which finally assumed such a scope that Hedwig Brack was happy to be able to switch to the planning directorate in 1957, where it was responsible for financial planning.In 1971, after 42 years of service, she retired well -deserved.
She remained even connected to the flying with her work for the “Pro Aero” foundation, which she together with Prof. Dr.H.c.Eduard Amstutz supervised.Despite age -related health problems, Hedwig Brack continued to take a lively share of everything that affected her beloved Swissair.It was the most competent point of information in terms of company history, so to speak the personified Swissair chronicle.
She has no longer been able to put up with the wild development of "her" company in recent years.The renaming to Sairgroup was deeply contrary to her.Last December, Hedwig Brack was admitted to the hospital, where a serious illness was diagnosed, which she succumbed to on January 17, 1999.

A control instrument for air traffic / / the design of the Subject Plan Infrastructure of Aviation (Sil), which has been in public for a few days, is on the one hand an inventory of all systems relevant to air traffic, and on the other hand, after the noise limit for state airports, it comes to the function of a spatial planningControl instrument too.An optimal interplay of air and rail traffic is expressly required.
A strong growth of air traffic is still to be expected world and Europe.The Federal Council wants to create a planning and control instrument that coordinates and brings in accordance with the requirements of spatial planning and environmental protection.The SIL is a comprehensive overarching of today's state of the aviation infrastructure, it shows possible developments and the resulting demands, contradictions and potential for conflict.
It formulates goals and set priorities.Civil aviation as part of the national and international transport system is intended to fulfill its role safely and efficiently and take into account the fundamental needs of society, business and the environment.An optimal interplay of air and rail traffic is expressly required.
In the foreground is a better integration of the Swiss rail network into the European high -speed network.The competitiveness of faster rail connections on distances between 500 and 800 km should be used better in the future, which would lead to a relief for the state airports.In addition, increased cooperation and division of labor among the airports will be postulated, whereby it is reminded that it is important to bring complementary potentials and forces and use synergy effects on a broad basis.
In the explanations of the SIL, it is also pointed out that privatizations can create important prerequisites so that the airports remain independent, capable of acting and for investors and alliance partners.The statements about the environmental area are important for the environment for airport residents.This means in the stipulations of the state airports: «Airport and aircraft operators are still to be obliged to prevent the avoidable noise pollution and pollutant emissions and to restrict the inevitable to a minimum.
In the foreground of the measures for noise and pollutant limitation are the emission-dependent approval of the aircraft, emission-dependent fees, night flight restrictions, optimized traffic and operating processes (arrival and departure processes) as well as monitoring of aircraft noise development. »for the population can only fully develop if the noise is set limit values for the state airports.Based on these values, the noise zones can be excreted, which form an integrating component of the sil.The assignment to the individual noise levels decides on the measures to be made, which range from the exposure to construction bans, conversion orders to structural noise protection.
It is still premature to speculate about the financial consequences, even if there are major estimates.With regard to air pollution control, the responsible authorities are encouraged to align the planning to the goals of the air pollution regulation.Third construction stage from Zurich
Closing BUND in the draft on the Infrastructure Subject Plan expresses a priority interest in an economically and ecologically justifiable increase in performance of the three state airports, whereby the airport holders are instructed to keep the effects on the population, settlement and landscape as low as possible.The canton of Zurich also has to ensure that the necessary options are kept open to the development of the airport capacities.All objects of the 5th construction stage are entered in the fact plan.
In addition, the canton is encouraged to check the following projects in more detail: the extension of slopes 16, the expansion of the cargo systems (3rd stage), the expansion of the west zone and the development of the zone east.In addition, the airport-side development opportunities must be examined, taking into account any conflicts with existing protected areas and the military use of the Kloten-Bülach weapon place.Geneva Airport is particularly instructed to advance the implementation of the systems listed in the development program from 1996 to 2005;
This includes buildings for passenger handling as well as for freight and aircraft hangar as well as traffic and parking facilities.In Basel, where the airport is fully on French territory, the total Swiss interests of maintaining and further development of the airport are to be met.In the foreground is the expansion of the terminal in a first phase for 4.5 million passengers and the extension of the east/west slope by 300 meters.
The French building permit is available for the buildings;The financial resolutions are in preparation on both sides.In the far, the Sil demands the earlyest as soon as possible connection of the airport to the Swiss rail network and the European expressway network.
A look at the regional flight places to the state airports also apply to regional airfields that combine regions with destinations in Germany and nearby.Its network is to be improved with regard to the spatial distribution of offer and benefits with a sensible division of tasks in the interest of a powerful overall system.The nine licensed systems of Bern Belpmoos, Birrfeld, Ecuvillens, Les Eplatures (La Chaux-de-Fonds), Grenchen, Lausanne La Blécherette, Lugano, Samedan and custom are to be determined.
Dübendorf and the Zurich airfield is proposed by St. Gallen Altenrhein and Locarno when the conditions to be observed are met.The creation of a regional airfield near Bressaucourt in the Canton of Jura is also proposed as a replacement for the Pruntrut airfield.- Local and regional conflict is undoubtedly in the statements of the Sil to the Dübendorf military airfield.
It is emphasized that it is currently not possible to move certain civilian traffic shares to relieve Zurich Kloten to the military airfield, but such opportunities should be examined with a view to future needs and developments.The use of Dübendorf by Zurich Kloten is therefore to be included as an option in the SIL and also treated in the Military Subject Plan.
The examination of relief concepts and outsourcing potential for Zurich Kloten Airport is assigned to the canton as an airport holder in advance.(Here it should be said that the city council Dübendorf has set a program focus of the ongoing term of preventing a civilian use of the military airfield, where it can count on the support of neighboring communities.) Finally, note that the future of the Zurich Hasenstrick, Hausen, HausenAm Albis, Speck-Fehraltorf and Winterthur is considered secure.In close cooperation with the authorities of the federal, canton and municipalities, a airfield area must be created for this.
Expansion are not provided.The nature and function of the fact plan.According to the federal law on spatial planning, the subject plan is an instrument of the federal government for comprehensive planning and coordination of its space -effective activities.
It basically shows the same depth of statement as the cantonal directional plans.It is limited to the necessary spatial, temporal, organizational and financial principles and instructions for further planning.The fact plan Infrastructure of the aviation helps to relieve the content of the concession, approval and approval process for aviation systems and to accelerate it in terms of time.
Overarching questions such as the need and space structural classification of buildings and systems are already decided with the inclusion in the SIL.In contrast, in -depth detailed clarifications about the effects of projects on space and the environment are reserved for the following procedures.This applies in particular to the examination of environmental compatibility.
In order for the silver to remain a dynamic control element, it should be checked and adjusted periodically.The stipulations of the fact plan are binding for all stages.The SIL is a joint work of the leading Federal Office for Civil Aviation and the Federal Office for Spatial Planning.
It comes to the public edition and hearing in all affected communities these days.After the adjustment talks with the interpreters, the necessary adjustments are made.According to the examination report of spatial planning and two office consultations, the SIL will be sent to the Federal Council for determination.

Disillusioning flight attempts / / To the old dream of flying, Jürg Amann constructs a life story in his novel “Ikarus” that is also a poetic history of technology.We have made great progress through the ventilation: slide shade is trendy, aircraft are used as ordinary means of transport, balloon drivers circle the whole earth, astronaut build a laboratory in space - and where is it?
Exercises in the lifting Jürg Amann focuses on the history of flying in "Ikarus" on a human life.His protagonist has to cope with the first crash even in childhood: a sparrow he picks up is eaten by the cat during his early flight attempts.
In fairy tale age, the boy tries to withdraw from the ground with the flying carpet, in the "Dökterli" age with a tensile ointment.He spends the youth together with his father in scientific observations, calculations and technical drawings.Together they develop aircraft.
But: «There could be no question of flying, at best of swimming air, more of air diving.“And the result is a wreck every time.With the mother's skirts, the breakthrough succeeds:
The boy recognizes the principle of hot air balloon by them.From now on, father and son construct test balloons.Each crash is made up for with even more sophisticated technical facilities.
The balloon finally flies so high that the two run out of air and the father dies.The longing even exceeds these human limits: "After I buried the father, I started building a capsule", because without protection man does not endure heaven.
The last crash is the accident that came too close to the sun: the gas balloon opens in flames, the capsule falls back onto the earth."When I collapsed with my shadow, I opened".
End .Feather -light technology jürg Amann is fond of technical details that he describes meticulously.And yet his novel is about human longings;
From the development of a personality and the question of the driving force of progress that is in each of us.The fascination of “Ikarus” is precisely the successful synthesis of technology and poetry.Amann's world, in which a single person understands the development from mythical Ikarus to the world recordler Bertrand Piccard of the high -tech world of our present, is a thoughts.
Much of it may correspond to historical facts, others not.This is unnecessary to check, because Amann creates a primal scene of humanity in “Ikarus”: from the struggle of dreams and knowledge with the laws of nature.
With his feather -light novel - in the very casual humorous pictures of flight tests from earlier times, the author lets the thoughts of his readers disappear to philosophical heights.To wherever you think about why people actually dream of flying to this day and this dream could only be fulfilled to a limited extent, how tragic flight disasters - keyword: SR -111 - repeatedly illustrate.Perhaps it is just the unfulfilled dreams, the longings that inspire our spirits.

Mesmer's dream of dreaming all over life has dreamed of flying Gustav Mesmer (1903 - 1994).The man who came from near Ravensburg on Lake Constance wanted to fly from village to village with his own power.
Now there is his life on a radio play CD. After a broken carpentry apprenticeship and the diagnosis "Schizophrenia", the son of a Catholic family of farmers was brought to a psychiatric institution where the doctor held the following: "Has invented a flight machine.»Magazine articles on flight tests with bicycles apparently inspired him.
From then on, Mesmer constantly drew his models, "over which the layperson shakes its head," said the institutional files.Mesmer repeatedly attempted to escape from the institution.He has also expressed his dream of being as free as the birds "in pictures and poems. In 1964 Mesmer was moved to an old people's home to the Swabian Alb.
It was only there he and his work slowly met with attention.The first exhibition took place in Switzerland at the turn of 1985/86 in the Musée des Arts Décoratif in Lausanne.The name has been created that Mesmer has accompanied since then: "Ikarus vom Lautertal".

The night flight ban remains, but.../ / Even if the airport is privatized, no planes should be allowed to start and land in Kloten at night.
Night flight ban on Jürg Schmiddas is only regulated in an attachment of the operating concession and in the operating regulations for Kloten Airport.A legal anchorage has so far been missing.Many residents and the airport protection association therefore fear that the ban could one day be loosened or lifted.
The reasons: the increasing air traffic, the expansion of the airport and its privatization for years.The government councilor Ernst Homberger, responsible for the airport, has repeatedly assured that the regulation today is not shaken.Even with any independence, a future Flughafen AG must adhere to it.
Canton is not responsible. The distrust is therefore not removed from the world, as a request from the SP cantonal council members Ruedi Keller (Hochfelden) and Luzia Lehmann (Oberglatt) shows.They wanted to know whether the government council would be willing to anchor the applicable night flight restriction and the night aperture.The government council replied on Thursday, due to the applicable legal situation, the government was reserved for the federal government due to the applicable legal situation.
In order to regulate the night flight restriction in a cantonal law, the government is required to adapt the federal aviation law beforehand.The federal government will hardly offer any hand for this.However, the night flight regulations are to be anchored in connection with the determination of the noise limit values for the state airports and comprehensively in the regulation on the infrastructure of aviation (VIL).
This is at least the declared intention of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) and the Federal Office for the Environment, Forest and Landscape.The Aviation Ordinance does not have the status of a law, but the same effect because the regulation is generally binding federal law, explained the Bazl representative Adrian Uti.He is a project manager for the construction and operating permits of Kloten Airport.
A regulation of the night flights in the regulation is binding for the airport holder, regardless of whether this is the canton or a private company.The intention is to take over the night (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and the blocking period (midnight to 5 a.m.).So there are night flights in Kloten -regulated canton as an airport holder can only push the start of the blocking period for charter traffic by one hour and set their end to 6 a.m.
Furthermore, the canton can set the blocking period for private air traffic within the legally defined night time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.The government council did this in 1972.The traffic restrictions for Kloten Airport 1 are regulated in detail in Appendix 1 on the operating regulations.
Simplified the following applies: Line aircraft must not land from midnight to 5 a.m. or do not start until 6 a.m.The night flight lock begins at 11 p.m. for charter traffic and ends at 6 a.m.
And private aircraft are neither allowed nor land from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.There are half-hour tolerance areas for delays in line and charter traffic.The blocking period can also be lifted for emergency landings, rescue and state flights as well as for exceptional events (strikes).

Half of the flights canceled / / "There were conditions over Zurich yesterday as in years not.
Liliane Leuenbergman cannot say that everything was steadfast at the Kloten Airport yesterday.The residents came to an unusually quiet day: more than half of the planned 400 starts and landings were canceled until late afternoon.
"" This does not mean that all other movements have actually been carried out, "said airport spokesman Harry Sivec in the evening."" A part will be canceled at night."" Until noon only 11 planes had just started and 30 were able to land;
No numbers were available for the afternoon.In order to be able to carry out as many movements as possible, the airport directorate approved starts and landings in exceptional cases until 0.30 a.m.."" I've never experienced something like this, "said Peter Spühler, the deputy head of the airport maintenance.
"" "1986 fell 25 centimeters of snow, but at that time there were much fewer flight movements.We still had time."" Yesterday the fresh snow blanket was 30 centimeters thick at noon.
And it continued all afternoon.From two in the morning, 130 people were deployed and tried to keep the slopes and roller fields with 74 plowing and snow spinning.Sisyphean work, as SIVEC confirmed: "" We had both slopes free, an hour and a half later there were six centimeters of snow again.
"" The slopes could never use more than one or two planes in a row.Nevertheless, a closure of the airport, like in Basel, was never up for discussion.
The huge vehicles that blow the snow next to the slopes could not clear the roller paths in the face of the continued snowfall.However, that is not a problem, said Swissair press spokesman Erwin Schärer: "" Landing on snow is routine for the pilots.This often happens in Nordic countries. "" Giant mowing and green sneaking more, the room on the apron, around the parking spaces, was made.
There the snow cannot simply be blown away there, said Spühler: "" Otherwise there are half -meter -high Mahden that block the way for the aircraft."" So the snow was picked up between the parking spaces and only removed it to today.Meanwhile, the snow turned light green under the aircraft, and the planes themselves also presented themselves in this color.
Because the environmentally friendly stew that is injected on the planes is colored green.So it is clear which aircraft has already been escaped.In the departure halls, the feared chaos failed to materialize.
Many passengers had informed themselves in advance or got stuck in the snow themselves.Some flights could be diverted to Geneva and Milan;Some passengers switched to the train.
Because only a few machines could land, the transit hall was not too strub.Additional staff ensured that the waiting guests were catered for. "" You really want to go?With the beautiful snow?"" An employee at the information switch tried with humor.
But ultimately she couldn't help the passenger who wanted to rebook his flight to London.The few planes that could start are already hopelessly full, she said.He had to ask the airline that he had booked with the time he booked.
"" We cannot refund anything.Snow is force majeure, "said the Swissair spokesman."" But the right to the flight is preserved. "" Image Dominique Meienberg end

Ghostly calm at the airport / / asp.For once, yesterday the airport residents were able to enjoy calm.
Snow and fog swallowed the noise of the few machines that were sent on the trip or arrived.Until shortly before noon, 11 starts and 30 landings were counted, the latter placed less high demands on the slopes.The snow removal quipes were already offered at 2 a.m.;
An hour later, 120 people with around 100 vehicles were professionally prepared, as was found by Peter Spühler from the maintenance service of the airport directorate.The slope clearance is assigned to two well -rehearsed trains.Substantial and moving one after the other, 8 path sleds are used with attached sweeping windows per train.
In alternates, a slope could always be kept free for more or less long time.Yesterday the temperature allowed the waiver of the use of de -icing agents.However, the brake coefficient of the slopes is continuously determined to maintain security with a special device.
The evacuation of the apron was difficult.Soon huge snow piles piled up on limited space, which finally hindered the parking of the planes.Because the absorption capacities were not sufficient in view of the filling of snow, the path sled had to be pulled off in the afternoon.
A large evacuation, however, started at 10 p.m. after the flight operated.A large part of the flight passengers took the deletion of flights and transcripts relatively calmly.For once, the heads of station and their employees were not unhappy that the snow chaos hit a rather weak day.
The Swissair found that a large number of passengers made use of modern information and dispensed with the trip to the airport.Nevertheless, grapes from unsettled passengers formed in front of the information switches.The waiting areas in the transit area were looked after as much as possible by the airlines and provided with meals and tranking.
When no relaxation indicated around noon, the Swissair tried to reserve hotel rooms for stranded air passengers as a precaution.In particular, the Swissair operations center, which had to hit new dispositions on an ongoing basis, was particularly challenged.In view of the weak traffic, according to the boss Andreas Heiter, the control tower was rather calm and closed.
The greatest effort gave the traffic managers the lack of stands.Sometimes more than two dozen planes are said to have been in the air in the waiting rooms.In view of the uncertainty, the pilot of a flight of Hamburg-Zurich even decided to reverse the time of landing.
The situation visibly spoiled in the evening.However, precise statistical information was not available.What is certain is that at least half of the 400 movements planned until 5 p.m. had to be canceled.

Reason: 152 flights had to be canceled on Tuesday, only 16 could be diverted to Geneva or Milan.Overall, more than half of all flights had been canceled.A reasonably normal operation could only be recorded after 11 p.m.
Until shortly before one o'clock there were 30 starts and landings. "" The circumstances are good "" Flight operations went yesterday Wednesday."" Only "" around 100 flights had to be canceled - however, a large part was a return flight of flights that could not start on Tuesday.There were delays of departure of up to three hours.
Tram derailed from a blocked soft soft yesterday in Zurich, a 13 tram at the confluence of Bahnhofstrasse into Bahnhofplatz.The route had to be closed for half an hour.Nobody got hurt .
"" The cause of the derailment is probably a piece of metal that we have found in a switch, "said VBZ vice director Anton Wittmer on request.Where the metal comes from is still being examined.Two derailments had already occurred on Tuesday;
At that time, however, the cause was the snow that had been pressed into the course during clearance work.Snow removal from 3.30 a.m. With a record requirement, the snow was started in Zurich at 3:30 a.m.
"" There were 510 people and 205 vehicles.25 private individuals also helped with their vehicles when plowing ", said street inspector Hans Hedinger.It was quiet with the city and cantonal police.

Grandpass in the Swiss sky / / "The air routes in Switzerland are not as wide as in the rest of Europe. This leads to bottlenecks.
The result: more delays and canceled flights.Bern.- On February 25, Switzerland, together with some neighboring countries, introduces a new air road system.
Due to the changeover, Switzerland threatens flight delays and cancellations.In the first four weeks, Swisscontrol expects that it can offer less capacity.With the new air road network, the so -called Arn (Air Traffic Services Route Network), which is introduced in all 27 Member States of the European Air Traffic Organization, EuroControl, the capacities of the air routes in Europe are to be increased.
Difficult change for the coming years awaits strong growth of airline traffic: According to the EuroControl forecasts, in Switzerland alone, an increase in approaches and departure by 72 percent can be expected until 2010.The SwissControl, responsible for air traffic control in Switzerland, describes the new air road system as future -oriented.
However, it is not happy about the transition phase.In the first two to three days, it will be able to offer up to 50 percent fewer capacities.After that, it would be about 30 percent less during the first four weeks.
The effects on Zurich Kloten are still uncertain, said Swisscontrol spokesman Geli A. Spescha.Measures are currently being checked."" But there is definitely delays and flight cancellations. "" The Swissair emphasizes that the new air road system is very important.
Delays on European flights have increased in recent years.Swissair spokesman Martin Kaspar said that at the moment it could not be estimated how high the delays would be in the first few days.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) also expects significant disabilities in air traffic according to the announcement in the initial phase in Central Europe - and thus also in Switzerland.
The new situation wants to react, among other things, with an increase in the air traffic control staff.According to Spescha, Swisscontrol wants to recruit at least 20 air traffic controllers abroad and promote future air traffic controllers.From February 25th, according to Swisscontrol, the most flown air routes over Switzerland can only be flown over a width of almost 26 kilometers;
This makes air traffic three lanes in certain times instead of only two lanes.However, because the air routes in the other countries are 30 kilometers wide, the sky over Switzerland becomes a bottle neck.And if the Swiss Air Force flies training operations, the civil air traffic in our country is just under 15 kilometers wide corridors available. "" This means that civil air traffic is at least at the time when the Air Force claims its rights, a little less space available "" "", said Bazl press spokesman René Aebersold.
Before that, the width was about 18 kilometers.The solution found corresponds to the "" politically feasible "".A regulation regulates that the military can decide how much airspace it takes, said Aebersold.
The Swiss Air Force is accommodating the Swisscontrol in that it planned fewer flights in this phase, said Swisscontrol spokesman Spescha.The Air Force does not want to do without flights during this time.Swissair wanted to give away straight this has swissair according to
Press spokesman Kaspar challenged - but in vain.Specifically, she would have liked the Air Force to carry out no flights during the first four weeks.However, she was grateful that the Air Force will make "very extensive" "concessions of civil aviation in the first four days. (SDA / SMD)

Hans-Peter Wagner becomes too much / / aircraft noise from Belpmoos suddenly becomes the topic in Köniz.Wind makes - of all things - an FPS politician.
In Belp, in a sweeper, but also beyond the Aare in Muri, they speak up.The critics from the nearby residential quarters are always on the spot if the airport operator Alpar AG wants to expand the company in Belpmoos in any form.On the other hand, it has so far remained calm in the nearby Köniz.
To this day, at least today: Suddenly Hans-Peter Wagner speaks up and demands that his local council take measures to "reduce aircraft noise and air pollution by exhaust gases".Hans-Peter Wagner sits in the Könizer Parliament.He politicizes for the right -wing party PGSP and for the Freedom Party - and thus of all things for those forces that are otherwise fighting for unrestricted mobility.
It is not unselfish Wagner says it openly: he does not act unselfishly."The 6.15 o'clock flight awakens me every day," he confesses frankly.
In particular, that is affected by noise and exhaust gases that is part of Wabern, which lies north of the Sittigenstrasse, he writes.And thus means the single-family house zones Eichholz and Maygut, where he lives. «In these quarters, criticism of the Belpmoos is nothing new.“Wagner confirms, however, that she has never become loud so far.
His explanation: The affected areas only make up a small part in the extensive community. "Does nothing harm" The noise is becoming increasingly greater, Wagner complains.This is responsible for this, among other things, “increasing line traffic”.The airport is simply too close to the settlement area, it states, at least much closer than in Zurich.
The situation there is fundamentally different there.According to Wagner, the airport employee lived close to the Zurich airport in advance, and the noise doesn't matter.Wagner does not believe that the right -wing bourgeois surroundings resent him.

Kloten: Much more dirt into the air / / "Significantly more pollutant emissions and more noise at night- this is what the extended environmental report on the expansion of Zurich-Kloten Airport. By Jürg Schmidkloten.
- The Zurich airport is considered one of the ecologically leading airports in Europe.Even after the planned, a good two billion francs, this should not change, and had repeatedly assured airport managers and government council.However, this promise could soon dissolve into air, as the revised environmental report on the framework concession for the fifth expansion stage shows.
The report is available to the TA.If the forecast 401,000 starts and landings of line and charter traffic are handled in Zurich Kloten in 2010, nitrogen oxide emissions in and around 1995 take by 76 percent (without expansion) or even by 134 percent (with expansion)to .With this additional burden, the canton cannot achieve its goals for the renovation of the air, the report states.
The aircraft noise is judged no less concern.The noise of multi -traffic is largely compensated for by the less loud aircraft.But in the two hours before midnight and in the early morning, the noise values, especially in the north of the airport, will be considerably and large -scale above the limit values (temporarily defined to 55 decibels).
On the basis of this findings, the report comes to sobering and at the same time explosive conclusions: The environmental measures in the 1996 air program in 1996 were sufficient because of the "significantly higher emissions of air traffic".The development and thus the existence of the Zurich Airport would question harder requirements. "" Expansion nevertheless reasonable "" Because the airport is of national importance, it must be assessed privileged, the report is required in the report:
"" The expansion is justifiable despite the considerable environmental pollution."" Airport director Josef Felder did not yet want to comment on the extended environmental report, which will be presented on February 23 by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation.He knew the direction of the report, but has not yet studied it in detail.
Zurich, like any other large airport, is faced with environmental issues.At the end of June 1998, the Federal Supreme Court decided that the environmental report for the framework is based on false air traffic forecasts and must therefore be checked.A total of 240,000 starts and landings per year were expected for 2005;
1999
Kloten Airport: At night a lot more noise / / "The fifth expansion stage in Zurich Kloten will put a lot more stress on the environment than previously assumed.
There are many more air pollutants and more noise before midnight.By Jürg Schmid "" With the implementation of the fifth expansion stage, an area, which is already heavily loaded by aircraft noise, is even more stressed by aircraft noise, "" is the basis for the expansion in the additional environmental impact report on the framework.Although this was fundamentally protected by the Federal Supreme Court on June 24, 1999, the court had decided that the environmental impact report had to be revised primarily in the areas of air and noise, since it was based on outdated air traffic forecast.
The revised environmental report, which is available to the TA in extracts, is now based on the latest forecasts for Kloten Airport.According to this, in 2010 in line and charter traffic, 401,000 movements (starts and landings) per year will be expected;Including private air traffic (General Aviation) with 421,000 movements.
Then, five years after the end of the expansion, 38 million passengers are to be handled annually.The air is badly strained by the air, according to the report, the air, with and without expanding the airport.The nitrogen oxide emissions (NOX) generated by the airport increases around 1800 tons per year to 3440 tons in 2010 (operating state).
"Flight operations contribute to the lion's share of about 80 percent", the report states.In the start and area area, nitrogen oxide emissions will increase by 76 percent (without expansion) and 134 percent (with expansion) in the future.One reason for this is that "" the technological improvements in small and medium-sized aircraft are (over) compensated for by the increase in traffic.
Significant improvements in engine technology can be expected in 15 to 20 years at the earliest. "" The immission load with nitrogen oxide (NO2) will also be significantly higher than the limit for larger parts of the airport region.And in the partly carcinogenic VOC (fleeing organic compounds), the 1996-expected share of air traffic is exceeded by 60 tons per year.The limit is also exceeded for lung -like fine -congestion (pm 10).
These have been measured on the roof of Terminal B since May 1998.The values indicate that the limited limit of the federal government's air resistance regulation is exceeded by 25 percent.Canton fails air hygiene target
The air traffic in Kloten, which is predicted today in 2010, will also be handled real, the canton will not reach its destination for renovation.The conclusion for the nitrogen oxide pollution is: "" The proportion of airport in the overall emissions in the canton increases to 20 to 25 percent."" With all measures ordered in the cantonal air program in 1996 in 2010 in the cantonal area with a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by 2800 tons to 12,550 tons annually.
The renovation goal is 12,000 tons.With the newly calculated load on the airport (plus 3440 tons), the total load will increase by 1490 tons to 16 840 tons.The report also includes: "" The nitrogen oxide renovation goal is not being achieved from 2005 to 2010 due to the predicted air traffic growth, even when the emission-dependent steering tax requested. "
Aircraft noise is largely compensated for the increase in movements with the replacement of older aircraft by new, less soft types.According to the report, the aircraft noise pollution increases only slightly during the day in the north and in the south of the airport, with simultaneous relief in the west.However, there is no reason for a relieved breath.
The residents are likely to worry about the following findings: "" In the night hours, however, the loads are increasing significantly, especially in the north and lead to large -scale crossing of limit.Their "" significant increase during the night hours (not to be confused with the night flight locking time) results from the starts between 10 p.m. and midnight and the landings before 6 a.m.Because the airport directorate and Swissair have already carried out all possible measures for noise limitation at the source, the privilege provided for in the law must be used for the remaining loads, the report is proposed.
In concrete terms, this means according to the information of a recognized state expert: According to the federal noise protection regulation of the federal government, public investments may, and this includes a concession -like airport, make any amount of noise if avoiding noise is economically unacceptable.If this exceeds the alarm values, the operator must pay the residents the sound insulation.
Air traffic before the environmental of the overall assessment comes to the conclusion: The Federal Supreme Court equated the Kloten Airport as a transport system of superordinate importance to the national roads and thus also granted a certain privilege in the field of air hygiene.A prerequisite for the concession is the presence of cantonal measures planning (Air Program 1996).
However, the existing planning can no longer be sufficient.The conclusion of the supplementary report is explosive: "On the other hand, there are no measures in sight that can reduce this burden without questioning the future development and thus the existence of the Zurich Airport.
In the sense of the Federal Court, the concession decision must therefore include the national importance of airport in the balancing of interests.The expansion is therefore justifiable despite the considerable environmental pollution."

Oldest cabin aircraft damaged by fire / / raron, February 16.(sda)
The fuselage of the oldest still able to fly in Europe was damaged by a fire on Monday evening in Raron (VS).The fire was created in the hangar during welding work on a neighboring plane.Nobody was injured.
The police put the damage at CHF 100,000.The Comte AC-4 “Gentleman” from 1928 should be repairable, as the owner, the “Geo Chavez Flyers”, was said on Tuesday.The fuselage in particular was damaged;
However, the engine and wings are not affected.The plane was completely restored in 1996.The one -engine machine was bought and restored in 1961 after 3616 flight hours from the “Geo Chavez Flyers” in Raron, a club by lovers of old planes.

Higher nature violence / tst.After the one -hour drive on the Piccadilly Line, which we have witnessed as standing space passengers, we are happy to finally arrive in Heathrow and have our luggage ready.We wanted to be at the airport in good time to climb the viewing terrace before sunset and take a few pictures of the beautifully painted rears of the local airline aircraft.
However, our vigor is slowed down at the check-in switch.The flight from Zurich is "canceled".Reason: 50 centimeters of fresh snow in Kloten.
At the Swissport London switch, we inquire a little dazed at the switch of SWISSPORT.We have several options: One of them is to look for a rebooking option.
The second variant to go back to the city and spend another night in the hotel on your own account ("We cannot pay for additional costs in the event of unpredictable natural events"), we are just as important as the suggestion to spend the whole night at the airport, we are just as important("It has a lot of shops") and the first plane to climb the first plane to Zurich the following morning.The somewhat surprisingly succinct answer of the representative of a European quality airline contrasts strangely with the remark of a young man from Malaysia, who, like us, chose the first option and when asked why he chose Swissair: "It has a good service.“We still believe him and line up in the infinite queue of those who want to get a seat on another flight.
Now it is an advantage to have a mobile phone with you in order to continue to register the changed signs of the return trip and its effects in your home.We are lucky .A compensatory compatriot who spends himself as an experienced businessman despite the lack of a tie spontaneously loaned his device.
The fate also means well with us at the rebooking switch.There are still places available on the flight SR 837 to Geneva.We don't hesitate for a moment and release our luggage, although the target airport is different and we run the risk that no train will run in Cointrin.
In the meantime it has become evening.When the gate number is still not known half an hour before departure, we fear further inconvenience.It is also strange, which is why the passengers are never informed about the emerging delay of the aircraft from Geneva, neither on the monitors of Terminal 2 nor through Swissport's staff.
On the plane we will later receive the somewhat rugged answer of a female flight attendant: the delay is a result of the poor conditions in Zurich.Boarding takes place at 7 p.m. 55, five minutes before the planned departure time.
Then, around 40 minutes late, the Airbus 321 still lifts off.After the problem -free landing in Geneva it turns out that the traveler from Malaysia should be right.Since shortly before midnight on a journey home with public transport, there is no longer any way of thinking, we are immediately offered a hotel room of the upscale class - including a transfer in the taxi.

A giant bird must not crash / / by Anatol Johansen · The Swissair should become dear child of the European aircraft manufacturer in the next few years.
Because in 2005 at the latest in 2005 the Swiss aviation company will be the only airline in the world that only flies European Airbus.At this point, the last non-European machines, the Jumbo-Jets Boeing 747, are to be replaced with the most modern long-distance jets in the Airbus Industry, the four-engine A340-600.Already today, the Airbus farmers, who almost thirty outsiders started their fight against the then overwhelming American competition as a quasi-hopeless outsider, almost reached their old goal.
In any case, a total of 556 fixed aircraft from Toulouse is now registered for 1998 - options and declarations of intent are not expected.The Europeans have thus conquered around 48 percent of the global market for transport aircraft with more than a hundred seats.So you are almost on par with the American market leader Boeing.
In Toulouse, a stroke is prepared in eight hundred and a blow, which should catapult Europeans worldwide to the top of the aircraft manufacturers.Together with twenty large, internationally operating air lines as well as with airport companies and aviation authorities, Airbus industry is working on the concept of an aircraft that the world has not yet seen.
The Airbus A3xx should offer space in basic version 555 passengers.Later versions could have seats in a “high density” design up to eight hundred.To date, there is no passenger plane of this order of magnitude.
The largest nozzle traffic plane, the Jumbo Boeing 747, has - for example at Lufthansa - to about four hundred passengers.So far, he is completely unrivaled in his size, much to the annoyance of the Airbus Industry in Toulouse.So far, Airbus has nothing to oppose the Jumbo and has to watch Boeing clearing up the market in this area.
After the Airbus team has continued to meet the representatives of about twenty air lines for years in order to determine the exact needs and expectations that the new super flyer is supposed to satisfy, the draft for the A3xx is brought into its final form.Then a detailed offer will come from Toulouse, in which not only the exact configuration, but also all performance data and the costs of the A3XX are communicated.The reaction of the companies will then depend on when those responsible in Toulouse will give the final starting signal for the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
The development costs are ten to twelve billion dollars and are therefore hardly higher than those of the Airbus long-haul family A330 / A340.This speaks for an inclusion of production.
And also: Boeing, which wanted to dig up the water with a stretched version of their old 747 of the A3xx, is flashed with the air lines.If the companies already want to buy a new large aircraft, the opinion of Airbus, then rely on the latest technology and not on a machine that, like the Boeing 747, is now forty years old.In fact, the A3XX breaks with conventional technology.
It starts with the length of the machine.It reaches 78 meters, with a span of almost eighty meters - the jumbo jet, on the other hand, only brings it to sixty meters in length and seventy meter span.Completely new in the history of the aircraft construction, the double -sized fuselage of the machine from front to back: with an upper and middle flight deck for passengers and a lower deck for freight and other.
When using conventional technology, the dimensions of the A3XX would have to mean that the tips of the wings would hang down by 3.5 meters just because of the weight of the wings and struck up in the flight accordingly.Likewise, when using classic materials, the entire aircraft fuselage would no longer be stiff, but elastic.Figurially speaking: the plane would soon have a curved back and soon a hollow cross.
Such bending vibrations are extremely undesirable.Among other things, they affect the controllability of an aircraft.In addition to the traditional aluminum, which still bears the main load, the A3xx should not only provide new materials for the strength of the super airbus, but also for weight savings.
The material aluminum aluminum will make up 140 tons of the expected maximum starting weight of the machine in the amount of 540 tons (with passengers).In addition, there are now 35 tons of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, 15 tons of titanium and 13 tons of high strength steel.As far as aerodynamics are concerned, Airbus himself speaks of "unique challenges".
Nevertheless, all attempts in the most powerful European wind tunnels would have shown that the requirements placed could be met both at low speed and in the high -speed range.The new aerodynamics of the A3XX are not just about performance and security.The so-called vertebral tower, i.e. the zone of very restless air, which the super airbus is also behind it must also be observed.
In the interest of other aircraft.Because this vertebral drag, which is currently only a few thousand meters on the largest aircraft, the jumbo jet, would have to grow to the A3XX, because of its significantly larger volume, for at least thirteen kilometers.So large would have to be the safety distance to the next landing machine, which would of course be a clear disadvantage in heavily frequented airfields.
Development goal at Airbus: The vertebral towing of the A3XX does not make it longer than the jumbo jet.There will also be innovations in the wings.They are to get a so -called laminar profile that ensures that the air is as smooth as possible and resistance -low as possible.
For this purpose, the wing and the pantry edges are covered with a titanium layer, into which a laser drills countless tiny holes - diameter 0.05 millimeters, distance from hole to hole 0.5 millimeters.Appropriate research has long been promoted at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).Currently, the new technology is already being tested on the ailer of a smaller A320 Airbuss.
With the use of a laminar profile at A3XX, Airbus technicians want to save around 13 percent fuel.That would be a very important margin in an area where every percentage point counts.The new machine should become cheaper and better than everything known.
Weight savings, new materials, laminar wings and what the innovations are more, have this goal: to be able to offer the passenger place about 15 percent cheaper than the jumbo jet.The air giant also contains new problems to the engine manufacturers.The new Super Airbus, according to Rolls-Royce, could weigh up to fifty percent more than the Jumbo, which is brought to speed by four drives, each with around thirty tons.
The A3xx would need four engines with about forty tons of thrust each - which must also work as economical as possible, environmentally friendly and quiet.Appropriate developments are currently in the works with the “Trent900” motor at Rolls-Royce.Huge engines required. The European aircraft manufacturer is therefore challenged with the A3XX.
Particular care in the development of the A3XX is used to reliability and flight safety - no wonder in view of the high number of passengers that the major flyer can take on board.In the event of a disaster, all passengers must be evacuated from the machine within ninety seconds, and only by half of all aircraft doors - for an emergency, you calculate that not all doors are free and intact.As for the Black Boxes, i.e. flight writers and voice recorder, the Airbus designers consider whether they should place several in their new machines.

A giant bird must not crash / / von anatol JohansenAirbus wants to build the world's largest jet - require new risks
New technology Swissair should become a loving child of the European aircraft manufacturer in the next few years.Because in 2005 at the latest in 2005 the Swiss aviation company will be the only airline in the world that only flies European Airbus.At this point, the last non-European machines, the Jumbo-Jets Boeing 747, are to be replaced with the most modern long-distance jets in the Airbus Industry, the four-engine A340-600.
Already today, the Airbus farmers, who almost thirty outsiders started their fight against the then overwhelming American competition as a quasi-hopeless outsider, almost reached their old goal.In any case, a total of 556 fixed aircraft from Toulouse is now registered for 1998 - options and declarations of intent are not expected.The Europeans have thus conquered around 48 percent of the global market for transport aircraft with more than a hundred seats.
So you are almost on par with the American market leader Boeing.A eight hundred seats In the meantime, a blow is being prepared in Toulouse to catapult Europeans worldwide to the top of the aircraft manufacturers.
Together with twenty large, internationally operating air lines as well as with airport companies and aviation authorities, Airbus industry is working on the concept of an aircraft that the world has not yet seen.The Airbus A3xx should offer space in basic version 555 passengers.Later versions could have seats in a “high density” design up to eight hundred.
To date, there is no passenger plane of this order of magnitude.The largest nozzle traffic plane, the Jumbo Boeing 747, has - for example at Lufthansa - to about four hundred passage.So far, he is completely unrivaled in his size class, much to the annoyance of the Airbus Industry in Toulouse.
So far, Airbus has nothing to oppose the Jumbo and has to watch Boeing clearing up the market in this area.After the Airbus team has continued to meet the representatives of about twenty air lines for years in order to determine the exact needs and expectations that the new super flyer is supposed to satisfy, the draft for the A3xx is brought into its final form.Then a detailed offer will come from Toulouse, in which not only the exact configuration, but also all performance data and the costs of the A3XX are communicated.
The reaction of the companies will then depend on when those responsible in Toulouse will give the final starting signal for the largest passenger aircraft in the world.The development costs are ten to twelve billion dollars and are therefore hardly higher than those of the Airbus long-haul family A330 / A340.
This speaks for an inclusion of production.And also: Boeing, which wanted to dig up the water with a stretched version of their old 747 of the A3xx, is flashed with the air lines.If the companies already want to buy a new large aircraft, the opinion of Airbus, then rely on the latest technology and not on a machine that, like the Boeing 747, is now forty years old.

As for the Black Boxes, i.e. flight writers and voice recorder, the Airbus state-of-the-art authors consider whether they should place several in their new machines.And whether it would be reasonable to install video recorder as Black Boxes, which then also show optically and no longer only acoustically, as was explained in the cockpit in the now half hour before an accident.Anatol Johansen is knowledge of knowledge with a specialty Air and Ramfahrtin Toulouse is prepared for a coup:

Directional flight roads in the sky / / with the Air Route Network (ARN), a new European route system for air traffic, EuroControl wants to increase capacity in the air as a umbrella organization of the national flight safety companies and liquefy traffic at the same time.With the simultaneous introduction of legal transactions on direction -separated flight roads, Swiss air traffic will initially be threatened difficulties and bottlenecks.asp from February 25.
The high increase rates in international air traffic force to better use the airspace.To achieve better traffic rivers, the new European concept of Eurocontrol demands new air routes of 16 nautical miles, a directional traffic routing and legal transactions.Switzerland can only partially meet these demands, as civilian and military interests collide in the limited space.
The aircraft is currently not willing to release the space allocated to it to the extent required.The defense of the acquis is justified with references to your army order, which requires extensive training.In the case of military use of airspace, civil air traffic is therefore only available to two air routes with 8 nautical miles to the south and southwest (Geneva).
During the military -free period, the air routes can be flown with a side distance of 14 nautical miles.This means a capacity gain of at least 20 percent, as can then be flown in three lanes.During the first four days of the transition from February 25, the two air routes are available in full width, which should make work a little easier.
The upcoming conflict of use between the military and civil aviation will be solved at the political level.A first intervention has already taken place.The reorganization shows how Josef Meier, head of the company Swisscontrol, explained at a media conference, but clearly that the capacity of the Swiss airspace is insufficient in the long run and that a fundamental political discussion about the future design of aviation in Switzerland is necessary.
Diverse difficulty difficulties during the introduction time of the new system are complex in nature.Because the previous soil aids can no longer be used in the direction of use of the air routes, after radionavation, flown must be flown.
This requires new software in the aircraft on the on -board computers.It is still uncertain how the pilot deals with the innovation.The situation is more difficult by the fact that half of the airplanes used by Swiss airspace are located in a climbing or falling flight of or to one of the neighboring airports (Milan, Munich, Frankfurt).
The height and width, which are divided in height and width, require a very intensive radar monitoring with the necessary safety distances.Swisscontrol therefore clearly gives security in all matters.Great is the challenge to face the air traffic manager.
You must leave the well -established processes (which convey security) and approach the new constellations and gain new experience.They have been intensively prepared for the new circumstances for a short time and a half.The transition to Zurich is primarily found five additional crossing points in Zurich by the placement and drainage routes specified in the operating regulations and thus (temporarily) sacrosankt.
The threading and threading into the and from the air routes requires five additional crossing points, so that ten crossings can be monitored, which causes additional work for traffic control in the lower airspace.- In Geneva with just one slope, the transition, which is carried out at the same time as France, should be associated with fewer difficulties, especially because fewer crossing points can be managed.The situation in Basel is comparable to Zurich.
However, a new challenge can be expected at the time of the start of the summer flight schedule in 1999, as the Crossair will increase the number of its flights by 25 to 30 percent.A relief option towards the southwest is to bring a corridor agreed with the aircraft over the Jura.Based on the experience of introducing the new regulation in Scandinavia, Swisscontrol calculates with an introductory phase of 4 to 6 weeks.
As before, work will take place in the control tower by teams of two.As Josef Meier emphasized compared to the NZZ, an additional surveillance team will continue to observe the respective location and the development.Of course, a sufficient personnel reserve is also provided so that there are no additional bottlenecks in the event of possible failures.
Swisscontrol, airport directorate and Swissair have also built up a task force that can critically pursue the processes and can arrange measures at short notice.The Swissair has prepared very intensively for the changeover and capacity bottlenecks in all areas."For us, February 25 brings conditions like on a medium snow day, and we have enough experience with that," said Daniel, neither, Head of Operations Control of the Swissair.
The situation is not described as threatening, although flight cancellations and delays between 30 minutes and 3 hours are expected.The customer information is given great importance, whereby all modern possibilities today are exploited.From February 25th, a call center with the free telephone number 0800 800 750 is also available.
Neither reassures: "We transport all passengers to their destination." Night flight regulations Loofer The Airport Directorate Zurich contributes to mastering the situation with loosening the night flight regulations for line traffic, which, however, are still to be approved by the government council.If necessary, the beginning of the night flight ban will be pushed out until 1 a.m., with a restriction to initially two weeks, as was to be found by the deputy director Alfred Ruh, who hopes for the exceptional situation.

Should the airport region become uninhabitable?/ / "Kloten: Much more dirt in the air, TA from the 15th of 2. even more dirt, even more and longer noise.
The horrendous increase in pollutant emissions in the next ten years makes the so -called ecological model airport mutate into a harmful slingshot.The noise compensation of the multi -flights through less loud aircraft, if at all, opens up at most mathematically on paper.The calculation method used has hardly anything to do with the feeling of the approximately two hundred thousand affected children and adults.
Under the guise "" National Significance of Airport "", the responsible, so far less innovative politicians and civil servants, are not forced to do something for the population, which is massively affected in their quality of life and health.If the forecast development is approved unhindered, this is equivalent to an aggressive resettlement policy.A sensible limitation of flight movements in qualitative and quantitative terms is urgently necessary and must now be enforced.
A simple example: The international connections for the business world must be ensured within reasonable times of the day.However, low -cost tourist flights of individual travel agencies do not meet "national importance" "and are therefore clearly prohibited.With the introduction and enforcement of the cost truth, unnecessary flights would also be drastically reduced.
Walter Hunziker, Dietlikonauf the Zurich Airport, has a quality before quantity, repeated government councilor Homberger at every occasion.An additional burden by 134 percent of nitrogen oxide pollution is the now known reality of the unchecked traffic gain.
Aircraft noise is in no way stagnated - as claimed - the noise events over the southern communities have increased by more than 200 percent in the past three years.The strain from the noise carpet lasts all day without an interruption.Furthermore, with the increase in the number of flight movements, the likelihood of a crash above the densely populated agglomeration is significantly increased.
It is now about compliance with limit values, that is, law and law.It is finally time to set limits to air traffic.With Alpine Transit, you don't pursue politics to attract as much traffic as possible.
The role of Zurich Airport should again be classified as "" Airport for Switzerland with a good international connection "".The "" "arms arm" "around the largest hub is to be abandoned.Fritz Kauf, Bassersdorfim Last autumn, the airport holder published the revised forecast values for Zurich Airport.
In order to take into account optimistic growth for the environmental report, around 400,000 starts and landings were assumed, which would be possible after the 5th expansion stage.When and whether these numbers are reached at all is on another sheet.Through a (targeted?)
Indiscretion have now been handed over to the "" Tages-Anzeiger "" a good week before the revised environmental report was published.From my level of knowledge, I have to assume that the "" Tages-Anzeiger "" "has deliberately only leaked those facts that help paint a dark future.It is not said that not all technical possibilities for improvements are still exhausted in terms of noise and pollutant emissions.
Likewise, it is not mentioned that the fleets of many airlines will become much more environmentally friendly in the next few years.The fact that there are certain additional pollution for the environment with traffic gorges, be it on the street, on the rail or in the air, is a fact that is not questioned by anyone.It is important that you do everything that is reasonable to keep these additional loads as deep as possible.
And so far the Zurich Airport and its main user, the Swissair, have repeatedly proven this.You will do that in the future.Willy
Fighter, head of operational regulations
And procedure, Swissairwie long will this nonsensical madness go on?What we need would be an occupancy of the kerosine with a tax that contains all external costs according to the cause principle and a flight ban for routes under 500 km.That would automatically reduce the flight movements.
Admittedly, the profits were a lot smaller.But isn't it that the largest part of our today's prosperity is based on a loan that the next generations have to shell out?Gerhard Cornu, Zurich "

"" "" "" "" "" / "" The revised environmental report on the expansion of Kloten Airport considers the increasing burden on residents to be bearable- and for competitive reasons is essential.
By Jürg Schmid and Erwin Haas "" The airport is more, and significantly more than just a source of noise and stench, "said government councilor Ernst Homberger (FDP) on Tuesday in Kloten.The expansion of the Swiss goal to the world is a question of fate for the competitiveness of the economic and work region in the area of Zurich, yes across the country.In 1995, the Zürchervolk answered this question with a two -thirds majority.
Nevertheless, "" not a single cubic meter excavation could still be removed, not a single load concrete and not a single nail was broken.And that in a country that wants to connect to the EU.There must be thinking that the approval process takes longer than the construction itself. "" With these words, the economy director at the Airport Conference Center initiated a long -awaited press conference.
Airport director Hans -Peter Staffelbach, the overall project manager of the fifth expansion stage, Albert Brunner, and the planners held the same opinion: the expansion of the airport was inevitable and reasonable and must be tackled - now.Bleak
The supplementary environmental impact report (UVB) was presented with the fifth airport construction stage, which the Federal Supreme Court had requested from the canton of Zurich as an airport holder at the end of June 1998.The framework concession granted in 1997 was challenged by a number of affected communities and the airport protection association.In Lausanne, the concession was then fundamentally protected, but the forecasts based on the UVB were assessed as "" clear and inevitable "" "" clearly and inevitable ".
The traffic forecasts had been massively corrected, from 240,000 flight movements per year (forecast 1990) to up to 400,000. The federal court therefore asked for a new assessment of air hygiene and noise.This revised report was already presented in the basic features by the "" Tages-Anzeiger "" on February 15.
It not only relies on the demand forecast - like the previous UVB - but also on the maximum capacity of the airport in 2010. The paper provides for the "Worst Case" ", the worst case.Pollutant pollution in particular becomes increasingly a problem.
Flight operations including rolling movements, the handling on the roller field and the country traffic and parking garage were taken into account.The nitrogen oxide emissions were in 1997 at a good 1800 tons.Flight operations contributed to 1175 tons or 65 percent.
The handling produced 170 tons, the road traffic a good 460 tons.In the actual state (without expansion), the sum increases to almost 2620 tons by 2010, in the "operating status" "" with 400,000 flight movements per year to 3440 tons, of which 80 percent go to the account of flight operations."" For larger parts of the surrounding area "" The nitrogen oxide burden is also "" significantly above the limit "". Additional Parkhausetwas Rosiger is according to
UVB for the country's traffic, which will grow by 52 percent today.However, the system will be able to cope with the growing passenger flows (now 19.3, 34 million in ten years).With this forecast, however, the Glatt Valley, not even projected, is expected.
In addition, an additional parking garage with 3000 parking spaces appears in the plans of the airport directorate, but this does not bring any additional burden due to the proportion of long -term parkers.The airport representatives are even more confident about noise: the extension of the blind landing slope to the north will bring noticeable relief to the most troubled communities of Opfikon-Glattbrugg and Rümlang.
In addition, in 20 Zurich communities and in Buchberg SH Schallfahrferne (see graphic). Requirement on a privileging report comes to the conclusion that the planned measures of the canton are unable to meet the new, significantly higher emissions of air traffic.Additional measures are not in sight, and Ernst Homberger does not think it makes sense that the government council would still think about them: "" The ball is now with the federal government."" The airport as a traffic system of national importance is entitled to the privilege provided for in the law.

"" "I don't want to dispel fear" "" / / "In aviation, the economic element should not be weighted more than the environment. This said Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger in a conversation with Ta.Min Moritz Leuenberger said Jürg Schmid with the end of theThe Swiss Airlines receive bilateral contracts the admission ticket to the liberalized EU air traffic market.
The downside: Air traffic strains the environment more than expected.What does the Federal Council do against the excessive air traffic?Air traffic is actually increasing, but not because of the bilateral agreement.
This is more likely to lead to a rationalization of flights.There are contracts with other countries, for example the OpenSky Agreement with the United States, which rather cause air traffic.The task and responsibility of politics is to ensure a coordinated transport policy.
For this purpose, the external costs should be blamed for all transport companies.At the international conferences of transport and environment ministers, Switzerland is therefore committed to taxing the kerosine.However, this question can only be addressed globally.
As a former Zurich government council, you know the problem of Kloten Airport very well.Air traffic develops at a sharp pace.They carried out the airport on the 50th anniversary of the air:
Switzerland needs a prospering airport.However, growth must not be limitless.Where is the pain limit for you as a transport minister?
At the moment, the broad discussion of the very important fact plan Infrastructure Aviation, the SIL is running in Switzerland.There are questions like: How much air traffic do we want?
Which air traffic?How should the existing airfields be used?After the consultation, for example, we will have to decide whether charter flights should not be carried out from Basel instead of Zurich or whether a previous military airfield for private flying should be converted.
One thing is clear: air traffic must also be built into an international overall traffic concept.For flight times under an hour, fast trains may be more suitable than aircraft.That is why we expand the rail infrastructure with Neat and Bahn 2000.
And that's why Europe is investing in the railway high-speed network.The new environmental report is on the airport expansion that the airport will endanger stricter measures against noise and pollutants.Does politics surrender to the economic constraints?
Just not.Politics sets a framework.The airport directorate is also aware that traffic development and noise cannot be limitless.
The focus is on a sustainable transport policy.This means that the Federal Council also takes into account environmental and social aspects in addition to the economic importance of the airport.It is no coincidence that environment has become the central topic in research and development in aviation.
The economic element must not be weighted more than the environment.According to the revised air law, the federal government sets the guardrails for civil air traffic.These are currently still missing.
The airport residents, also bourgeois, are suspicious and fear bad things.Do you have a recipe against the fears of the population?I don't want to dispel fear, especially if they are justified.
Our task is to clarify the population, to have them commented and then implement their will.The voters have approved the airport expansion, as they have said to all larger expansion stages since 1946.Further votes will follow.
Nowhere are the procedures as democratic as ours.We have a democratized planning system.The population will continue to actively exercise their insight and design rights.
When does the Federal Council intend to determine the noise limit values for the state airports?The noise limit values will also go into consultation.It is planned to send the documents to anyone interested before the summer holidays.

Airport expansion and environmental pollution / / In the airport, the revised environmental impact report for the 5th stage of the airport expansion and the soundproof concept were presented on Tuesday morning, the public edition of which begins this week together with the construction concession requests.The most important environmental effects in the event of maximum loading on the airport system are a striking increase in nitrogen oxide emissions and an increasing aircraft noise pollution in the north with decreasing noise pollution in the west.
After the new air traffic forecast for Zurich Airport had been presented on September 8 of last year, the revised environmental impact report and the soundproofing concept requested by the federal authorities have now also been published, which include the documents of the construction concession procedure for the 5th construction stage.The economics director, government councilor Ernst Homberger, once and then oriented the media on Tuesday morning together with airport director Hans-Peter Staffelbach and the responsible project managers and then the media about the state of affairs.Overall economic
Aspekie Homberger, the canton of Zurich is obliged to ensure that air traffic can be safely and correctly handled as public transport as a airport holder through the concession to the federal government.Zurich Airport is a traffic system of national importance, as the Federal Supreme Court also states in its decision on the framework concession;
According to the words of the economics director, he has become "to the Switzerland Airport", and what happens here or does not happen here has direct effects not only on our economic region, but on the whole country - on the fate of the Swiss civil aviation as well as the competitiveness of the locationSwitzerland .From this aspect, the 5th construction stage and its effects on the environment are to be assessed.The Federal Supreme Court in Lausanne, which the framework concession approved for this, asked for a revised environmental impact report for the construction concession procedure, since the report submitted with the framework concession was based on a now outdated air traffic forecast.
The new report is no longer based on assumptions about the development of air traffic, but represents the case of maximum capacity utilization, whereby it remains open when it will be achieved and whether the maximum case can occur in practice.The economics director turned against a one -sided consideration of the effects on the environment.The increased loads, which have been calculated with the revised environmental impact report for the worst case, can be countered that the total noise pollution has remained approximately constant since 1990, despite the strong increase in flight movements, the number of heavily stressed people who have a permanent sound level (LEQ)over 65 dB (a) have to endure, has decreased to about half.
And as far as the current nitrogen oxide concentrations are concerned, the values raised for Zurich Airport (which are only partly from air traffic) are rather favorable compared to urban conditions (but are above the limit value of the air resistance regulation).Insulation publicly listed.During a period of just more than a month, the Swiss Federal Department for the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek) can be raised, which at best lead to so -called unification negotiations.It is counted with a procedure for around ten months to issue the construction concessions for the various objects of the 5th construction stage.
The concessions can be challenged with the administrative court complaint with the Federal Supreme Court.What other delays would result in such a case remains uncertain.Government councilor
Homberger, however, clearly expressed the opinion that after the clear referendum of June 25, 1995 for the 5th construction stage should finally be carried out;Because if the expansion continues to delay, the “Switzerland Airport” is threatened with the foreign competition very quickly to infect competitiveness - although there are no winners on the Swiss side, but a lot of losers.Different reactions (sda)
The reactions are different from the revised environmental impact report on the expansion of the airport.The Greens are calling for a new project, the “cosmopolitan Zurich” committee wants to build quickly.The communication of the Greens states that the government must present a new project for the airport, with which the limit values of the air clipping regulation could be observed and the noise pollution could be reduced.
For the SP, the “massive restriction of the quality of life” is unacceptable;She does not assume that the environment "gets under the bikes in this way" when weighing up the interest between ecology and the economy.The Swiss Protection Association of Flight emissions explains that the forecast growth of air traffic total contradicts Swiss environmental and climate policy.
The North interest group warns of an impending noise and pollutant avalanche in Zurich lowlands, which will lead to an enormous impairment of the quality of living and life as well as a price decay on the property market.- Different the committee “World Open Zurich”: The new report shows that the environmentally relevant effects of the airport “are justifiable in the overall show”.
From the federal government, the committee expects the treatment of the concession application for the expansion “with the highest urgency”.The basis for the new examination of the environmental compatibility of the 5th construction stage forms the instead of real supply capacity of the airport system after completing the 5th construction stage;This corresponds to 400,000 movements per year of line and charter traffic and 20,000 movements of General Aviation.
This offer capacity exceeds the demand forecast for 2010, which means that the calculations are based on a scenario of the worst case."This ensures that the results of the examination of environmental compatibility are on the safe side," emphasized government councilor Ernst Homberger.Modified slopes use concept concept has been taken into account in the calculations, the applicable night flight locking regulations as well as foreseeable options for reducing environmental pollution on the source.
Based on the operating regulations that are valid today, taking into account necessary adjustments to compacts of the flight schedule, especially in the afternoon and evening hours.As Airport Director Hans-Peter Staffelbach explained, it is necessary to use slopes 28 (“Westpiste”, the main start slopes) and the slopes 16 (“blind landing slope” with starts to the south) over the entire operating time for starts and to be used for starts andto assign additional landings to the slopes 28.The “16 Straight” departure variant is new, which after the start of slopes 16 leads straight towards Dübendorf with a light left turn over Opfikon.
These excursions to the south do not cause any additional expansion in the aircraft noise map.Because there are still no legal bases for the extension of the blind landing slope to the north, the effects of this measure, which also includes the so -called “right turn” with an excursion via Zurich 11, were not included in the environmental report.Different noise development The great weakness of the statements of the new review of environmental compatibility lies in the noise sector because the stress limit values for the noise of the state airports to be determined by the federal government are still missing.
The calculation of the noise pollution is based on the temporarily defined immission limit of 65 dB (a) (equivalent permanent sound level) for sensitivity level III (residential zone, in which moderately disruptive companies are permitted).can be compensated for by the increasing proportion of aircraft with quieter engines.While the loads remain practically the same in the south and north during the day, they significantly reduce themselves in the west.
In contrast, in the night hours (10 p.m. to midnight and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), the loads, especially in the north, increase significantly and, due to the larger number of movements and the lower immission limit values, lead to large -scale border value crossing.The corresponding border curve for the night time, which extends around to Zweidlen today, is moving out to the German Klettgau community of Griessen;In the east, Eglisau, Rüdlingen and Berg are affected on the Irchel;
Stadel, Bachs and the Bachsertal are also included in the west, while the expansions in Rümlang and Opfikon are hardly noticeable.It should be noted that the additional loads in the north essentially do not depend on the expansion of the airport, but correspond to a full use of the existing capacities.The additional capacities after the expansion would be primarily in the expansion of the areas with a nightly border value crossing towards the mountain on the Irchel and beyond Bach
Low down towards Wehntal.Increasing air pollution is the further growth of the air strain by pollutants, as project manager Walter Brunner from Envico AG explained;The goals of the cantonal air program that the Federal Supreme Court had taken as a comparison basis cannot be achieved.
If the airport produced around 1800 tons of nitrogen oxide in 1997 (the country -sided road traffic), this freight will increase at around 400,000 movements to 3340 tons a year.The proportion of airport in the entire nitrogen oxide emissions in the canton of Zurich thus increases to around 20 percent.The cantonal air program provided to reduce the entire nitrogen oxide freight to 12,500 tons a year by 2010, with a share of air traffic of 1600 tons;
The increase in air traffic does not allow this.The VOC (hydrocarbon) emissions only grow to a modest extent, namely from 570 to 670 tons.The annual average limit is exceeded in large parts of the settlement area of the canton of Zurich in the lung-related fine dust (pm10).
A clear direct contribution to air traffic cannot be seen;However, there is a clear dependence on motorized traffic.The airport has not remained idle in the field of air hygiene in recent years.
With the introduction of the emission -dependent landing fee since September 1, 1997, Zurich Airport has been the first airport in the world to take on a pioneering role.The aim of the measure is to process all flight movements with the best technology in the future.In contrast, the IATA, the International Air Transport Association, has raised a constitutional complaint.
A decision of the Federal Court is expected in the course of this year.In 1993, the airport owner submitted the BUND to the creation of a legal basis for the collection of a steering tax.The work is started;
However, the introduction of the levy cannot be expected before 2004.Part of the environmental report is also the country -sided road traffic.In particular, it showed that in addition to the additional parking places in the 5th construction stage with a new parking garage C and the increase in existing parking garages B and F, another 3000 parking spaces will be needed later.

61 deaths in aircraft crash in China / / Beijing, February 24.(Reuters)
When a Chinese transport aircraft crashed in the east of the country, all 61 people died on board on Wednesday.There was contradictory information about the cause of the accident.Representatives of the police and the aviation authority said that the Tupolew TU-154 had exploded in the air when approaching the city of Wenzhou.
The state news agency Xinhua, on the other hand, later reported that the machine of the China Southwest Airlines only had exploded during the surcharge.Accordingly, she drilled to the bottom before Wenzhou and exploded two or three seconds later.The plane was completely torn.
The aircraft crashed about 30 kilometers from the destination airport in a clear view.A doctor from the accident area reported that body parts, scraps of clothing and aircraft debris were scattered across the fields.Not a single body was found intact.
Hundreds of police officers and members of emergency teams searched for the area.All victims came from China, the airline announced.The plane started in Chengdu in the province of Sichuan.
The domestic flights in China are currently being used by many people who celebrated the Chinese New Year in their home tations and return to their jobs.The last major aircraft accident occurred in China in May 1997.At that time at least 35 people died when a Boeing 737 of the China Southern Airlines made a crash landing at an airport in the city of Shenzhen.

Does Delta Air Lines the Swissair fly away?/ / "At the end of this year, Air France wants to decide whether to form an alliance with Delta.
Delta partner Swissair can only watch - and fear.By Victor Breu, New Yorkam Sunday morning everything seemed perfect, project "Stockbruch" "a success.Delta Air Lines should take over Continental, number three in the USA swallow number five.
But everything was different on Monday morning.Continental had changed the opinion at the last second.Suddenly the takeover offer from Northwest Airlines, number 4 in the USA, preferred.
There is talk of a lot of awakening by Delta boss Leo Mulllin took place exactly a year ago.It is an example of what is currently going on in the air traffic industry: everyone talks to everyone who is flowing between the alliances, surprises everyday.
However, some talk more - and Delta Air Lines, the Swissair partner from Atlanta, are talking particularly much.As soon as the Continental deal had burst, the US company announced last April that with United Airlines, the industry leader in the USA, a expanded partnership would be received, with joint marketing and mutual seating sales.Only one thing has remained of the high -flying plans: United and Delta have combined their frequent flyer programs.
But that's interesting.Because United and Delta belong to various international alliances.United is the engine in the largest network, the "" Star Alliance "", in which Lufthansa, Varig, Thai, Sas and All Nippon are also included.
Delta, on the other hand, belongs to the "" Atlantic Excellence / Qualiflyer Group "", whose European partners are Swissair, Sabena and Austrian Airlines.A third international partnership, "" One World "", includes British Airways, American Airlines, Air Canada, Cathay Pacific and Qantas.Finally there is a fourth large structure with the brand new name "" Wings "".
Northwest, Continental, KLM, Alitalia, Air France, CSA CSA CZECH Airlines and China Airlines are located in this basket.Air France with a key role role in France pauses a key role in the carousel of the changing partners.The French cause Delta to once again try to shake the industry through.
They run together on a flight number with Continental - and in one case (from New York to Paris) with Delta.For a few weeks now, Delta, already number one in transatlantic traffic, has been negotiating with Air France, to launch a further 28 so-called code sharing flights to Europe with the French. "" Delta is interested in his relationship with Air Franceto expand, "" says Delta spokesman Todd Clay on request, "" that would result in a perfect marriage."" Of course Delta remains connected to the European partners Swissair, Aua and Sabena, according to Clay, there is "not either-or a both-too" ".
Delta boss Mullin became more snappy last week: "" Atlantic Excellence "" is just a partnership about the Atlantic, but Delta is looking for global cooperation.And there Air France offers a lot with his connections to Africa and Asia.Swissair: "" We have to look "" Such words are shouting on Swissair.
"The negotiations hurt us", "said spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz yesterday.Philippe Bruggisser, head of the Swissair mother Sairgroup, said earlier: "" We cannot ban Delta and have to live with Air France to strengthen their cooperation.We have to see how the two partnerships will develop side by side. "" Loud
Delta spokesman Clay announced Air France both Delta and Continental, at the end of 1999 they will choose a partner with whom a far-reaching agreement would be concluded."" We hope to win, "said Clay.Swissair is now playing the game as it allows your own strength.
In the United States, a code sharing with another partner is "" in the pipeline "," said spokeswoman Tschanz.According to analysts, this is said to be American Airlines on the traffic node (Hub) Chicago.

E. Marti drives two -lane / / The Carreisenverlierter E. Marti feels the erosion of flight prices.Despite falling sales, the operational result could be improved.
With a two -brand strategy, E. Marti AG now wants to open the low -cost segment.Theo Martin, Zurich the erosion of flight tariffs also has a negative impact on car prices.The difference between flight and cararrangements is getting smaller and smaller, said managing director Alfred Marti in front of the press in Zurich.
The holiday regions Alicante, Malaga and Ischia are therefore operated more and more by air.On the other hand, the northern Spanish coasts Costa Brava and Costa Dorado keep well, which will continue to remain cardestinations in the future.The turnover of E. Marti AG was CHF 124.5 million by CHF 3.6 percent behind that of the previous year.
The decline is due to cheaper arrangement prices and declining sales in the area of group and business trips.In contrast, the car tours and the area of goods transport and warehouse logistics show an increase.By optimizing the occupancy of flights and cars as well as by reducing production and sales costs, the sales must be compensated for well by increasing the yield.
Second brand knocking stone the number of cars was reduced by 5 to 31 vehicles to save costs.For this, tips are increasingly covered with rental vehicles.
The competitors traditionally help in this industry.Because Marti continues the strategy to strengthen the niches, the yield has increased.In order to position itself even better in the core business of the car travel, the company will in future rely on a two -brand strategy.
According to Heinrich Marti (Head of Reisen), the Marti brand sees itself as a generalist with a focus on quality tours of cultural imprint.In addition to the successful car program, the aircraft is also increasingly used on round trips as a feeder for local car.In the sub -segment of the cheap car trips, Marti will market targeted products in the future under the second brand Klopfstein.
The program, which appears in March, mainly contains trips to a target destination with a stand quarters, combined with an offer of excursions on site.For the time being, the main markets for this segment are the large spaces Zurich and Bern.In the area of the bathing holidays, the Marti brand stands for family holidays, which thanks to generous children's discounts had a very good value ratio, as Heinrich Marti explained.

Delays were limited / / "The threading to the new European air roads led to delays at Kloten Airport. But there were fewer waiting times than feared.
By Erwin Haas "The Sky Is Under Construction" ", it said yesterday on the Swissair homepage.In the current case, this means that the sky is re -networked.In France and neighboring countries, including Switzerland, a new, simplified, traffic -accelerating air road system came into force on Thursday.
Since security is going on, everyone involved must carefully get used to the new routines.The people responsible for the airport, Swissair and air traffic control (Swisscontrol) had therefore predicted that around 80 flights would be between 30 minutes and three hours delays on Thursday.Few cancellation -punch
Everything went much better than expected.Swissair press spokesman Martin Kaspar spoke of "" a little more, but much less delays than expected "" yesterday afternoon.The delays were between 30 and 60 minutes.
Only isolated flights were canceled, although even hard competitors ran up for once.In order to save on a certain amount of airspace, Swissair and KLM had painted some Amsterdam flights in the morning and put together neighboring courses.At 4 p.m. the delays for the evening were quantified on the Internet:
Departures west and southwest 30 to 60, arrivals from the same direction 60 to 120 minutes.Arrives and departures from and to the north and east up to 30 minutes.Flights from and to Spain and Portugal 30 to 60 minutes.
Delays of up to 120 minutes were announced in Geneva.The contrary to expectations, according to Kaspar, was due to three reasons.First, the Air Force made almost no use of its preference claim on Swiss airspace due to the weather in order not to trigger avalanches.
In addition, the pilots, air traffic control and airport staff would have prepared well for the innovations.Sonja Zöchling, press spokeswoman for the airport, did not find a huge rush for the attractions provided in the transit area (cinema, children's corner, chess).The new air routes were introduced in most European countries on Thursday.
The Scandinavian countries had already changed last autumn, Germany follows in early December.The key points of the new system are directional separators, continuous and straightened flight routes with better overtaking and fewer crossing points as well as the elimination of bottlenecks.A capacity increase of 30 percent should result.
Complex air traffic controller Josef Meier, the head of the Swisscontrol in Kloten Airport, have to master air traffic controllers and pilots in the narrow room via Zurich, especially in the narrow space of the traffic constellation and the navigation system.After the starts, the new routes have to be threaded differently, before landing it has to be threaded differently than before.The increased need for attention is cushioned by targeted thinning of the airplan.
For the time being, further delays are expected.Information on delays: Swissair free number 0800 800 570;Internet (www.swissair.ch, flight delays).

Sairgroup protests with reprint / / asp.The Sairgroup rejects the recent demands of the population of the population around Zurich Kloten Airport as incomprehensible and at risk of existence.
The intended three traffic -free two -hour time windows per slopes and day would make the Swissair impossible for an orderly company on their home base;After the Swissair assessed, the noise restriction for individual events should also lead to the decommissioning of two thirds of their long -haul fleet.The requested plan of the number of flight movements is called unacceptable, which would have to lead to a massive restriction of personal freedom of choice and unresolved questions about the allocation of the available aircraft seats.
The required expansion of the night flight blocking regulations is also rejected because this would not be possible for operational, not least for reasons of global time differences.The Sairgroup emphasizes that it will comply with the applicable night flight ban and will continue to work to exhaust all possibilities to improve noise and pollutant situation.It has therefore taken the renewal of her entire fleet by the hand more faster than originally planned.
With investments of almost 5 billion francs, it would massively reduce the noise and pollutant emissions.The Sairgroup is disappointed that much higher requirements are placed on the airport and air traffic than on the other modes of transport.In its statement, the Sairgroup also reminds that it has achieved a size with an offensive strategy that enables a massively improved offer for Swiss customers and with almost 20,000 jobs in Switzerland, good opportunities for survival as an independent companyFix the location of Zurich.

Airfield expansion Grenchen: "Defend the beginnings" / / "Of interests and conflicts in the Witi", "Neue Mittelland Zeitung" of February 24, 1999. To Grenchen Airport expansion, which is said to be:
Slope extension around 200 m (45 m towards the west and 155 m towards the east) and a new instrument approach system.Now what do these “improvements” in the region bring?- the airfield: the same traffic volume (only about 70 percent of the slopes can be used due to the European standards), which mainly means: some hobby silots their pleasure and some privileged business people conveniently reach their companies or business partners.
- the residents: overflow of inhabited area in 140 to 150 m height in old loy and larger noise pollution in all surrounding communities of the airfield (a new approach route from the west is planned). The consequence: mainly on beautiful days, on weekends and always,If all residents of the airfield are entitled to relaxing free time, the planes will disturb the well -deserved rest.For day tourists, the cozy get -together in the garden management and on the banks of the Aare are constantly interrupted by departing and starting aircraft.How the storks of the well -known stork settlement react is not predictable.
With 90,000 flight movements a year, this is about 260 starts and landings per day, and on top days in summer probably much more.This is a matter of national importance in an area that has 8 protective objects within a radius of 5 kilometers, among other things, a water and migratory bird reserve, floodplain areas and amphibian spawning areas.Therefore defends the beginning.
The extension of the slopes must be rejected, especially the replacement of a proven instrument approach system with a new one with all its disadvantages for the population and the environment.Roland and Marlys Favre Selzach / Altreuzerbits Wildwuches lifts the "lid" when you read that special reptiles should occur around the fishing hut that is to be canceled.
I wonder why just about this fishing hut, and why do you know that?You know that the wild animals also adapt and stay where it is easiest to get to the food, such as the city foxes in Zurich.Furthermore, one reads from an ironically meant idea from Rüegg, FPS, which he had to withdraw because there are apparently people in this local council who (and obviously also) simply do not "check".
Nature is there and does not need people, it means that these people only forget all -trains that people are also part of nature, and has the right to recover and move freely, or does someone already haveA prohibition that turns directly to an animal group, banned in a school building, or in a grocery store "mice and rats have no access" or in the summer in the Badi mosquito and braking is prohibited from stinging the bathers ".And in a few years everything may be much easier, since you fence people in the zoo's (i.e. cities) and let nature run wild.Incidentally, you would also have to fence the mountains, because they are far too dangerous, as too many people die every year, as well as on the street, which you would have to prohibit immediately (indication for individual municipal councils from Grenchen:

The airport threatens permanent jams / / "Delays in air traffic, as it triggers the changeover to the new air routes, are likely to become everyday life. From Erwin Haasjosef Meier, head of the SwissControl air traffic control in Zurich Airport, no secret yesterday.
On Thursday, when the new European air road network was handed over to traffic in Switzerland, France and south -facing countries, delays of up to three hours were due to the new procedures for pilots and air traffic controllers (TA from Friday).The airways are now straightened, shortened, usually widened to 30 kilometers and separated direction.On the edge you fly back, back to the same height.
The system causes different paths when turning after the start and when it comes to forming before landing.Air traffic pressure increases the changeover of a capacity increase of 30 percent.With the new air road network, the possibility of using airspace on different floors (flight levels) also opens up even better, and Meier's concerns begin.
"" The way this European concept had to be narrowed in Swiss airspace will lead to the fact that Switzerland cannot keep up with the increase in capacity."" According to Meier, the delays that now arise from the carefully accomplished system change should increase under the constant growth pressure at the latest in the coming summer months.The introduction of the new airways are "the triggering moment" "to open the discussion and tackle the problem.
The Swisscontrol is worried about the new Crossair Eurocross network, which wants to expand the flight schedule by 25 percent in the summer.Meier said nothing to expand the Kloten Airport, which would bring a huge boost of growth.To the political component of the freedom of heaven, however, he did not take a leaf out of his mouth: "" It is a question of airspace management over Engen Switzerland.
Either you expand framework conditions and capacity, or you ensure that Switzerland becomes a needle farm in Europe. "" International agreement of poorly excluding international floating, European Switzerland cannot simply enforce the global partners like the Sunday driving ban for truck.This was already shown by the difficulties that were now preparing for the preparation work on the air road change.On Thursday, 736 movements were counted in the airport - about the same many as a week ago.
However, 36 aircraft (5 percent) were unable to meet the new system, or their crews rustled with non -dated documents.A wreath therefore only might wind the top European airlines."" The smaller and more exotic, the more flatter the information stand."" The umbrella organization Eurocontrol published the upcoming changes in autumn 1998 and started a survey to control the preparation.
Finally, she threw the beggar down because the airlines did not even react.The fact that the difficulties and delays on Thursday still remained in a bearable framework attributed those responsible for Swissair, Swisscontrol, Airport Directorate and Swissport of professional preparation in Kloten.There were fewer delays and cancellations than expected, the passengers were "well informed and understanding" ", the team of employees motivated.
31 Swissair flights were canceled, six of them because of fog in Basel, two because of an accident at Genoa Airport and 15 for Geneva.However, Daniel did not want to trivialize the moderate delays from Swissair.The departure punctuality in the 3-minute frame (normal 47 percent) was 18 percent, the arrival and departure punctuality in the 15-minute frame (normally around 75 percent) fell to 41 percent.
150 people were accommodated in hotels - ten times less than on the snow day of February 9th.The entire passenger warting times added up to 20,000 minutes.On normal days, this threshold is 5000, on snowy days at 25,000 minutes.
Between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. and after 8 p.m. the punctuality suffered the most.The night flight permit until one clock did not have to be claimed.The last course left Kloten at 11:45 p.m., the last landing was already at 11:17 p.m.
The layer extension of the employees - including 170 volunteers - will be maintained until 2 a.m. until and with Sunday.However, the toughest test is only carried out from March 9, even if the Swiss Air Force also takes up its full activities and the corridors for the civil aviation must be reduced.PICTURE
Thomas Burlafreier air traffic or trimmed wings?This is the question of capacity. "" Long -haul flights in danger ""
Sairgroup considers the demand of the population to be protected by Zurich Airport to be at risk.The protection association asked for the announcement of the new environmental impact report to limit the number of flights from and after Kloten for reasons of immission (air and noise).Traffic -free time windows should be set up per slopes, so that there is at least temporarily calm.
And the noise level should no longer increase over 92 decibels from 2001.Circumcision of the flight movements would, according to Sair "", "not least for reasons of global times of time" "" in fact a ban on the long -haul flights, or it would have to switch to Brussels: "" As the only airport in the world, Zurich would have to determine who can and can climb an aircraft andWho does not. "" With the early retrofitting of the fleet, the Sair Group has long started the proof that they exhausted all the technical possibilities to improve the noise and pollutant situation.She invested five billion francs.

A new American in Zurich / / Continental Airlines wants to establish itself in the Swiss market with a daily flight of Zurich-New-New / Newark.The start scheduled for April was postponed to June 2nd.
A DC -10 - 30 is flew, and Continental is particularly targeting passengers who have previously flown to the USA via Paris, Frankfurt or London.After American Airlines have given up the Zurich-Washington route from the New York-Zurich and United route, another big US carrier is now trying to do his luck in Switzerland.SX.
Continental Airlines threatened at the beginning of the nineties due to persistent unsuccessful unsuccessful, which other American airlines had already happened in the 1980s: bankruptcy and the disappearance from the market.The Continental Airlines, which emerged from the Varney Speed Lines in 1937, made headlines under the regime of Frank Lorenzo in the 1980s under the regime of Frank Lorenzo with high losses, equally dissatisfied passengers and employees.From 1983 to 1986 Continental was under creditor protection, half of the employees had to be released and many jets left on the ground.
But the airline recovered and catapulted itself through the purchase of People Express, New York Air and Frontier to a largely foreign mega carrier.In the pull of the Gulf War with rising kerosene prices and lack of passengers, Continental had to look for refuge again under the "Chapter 11".After Lorenzo's departure, the problems of this airline were far from solved, although in 1993 it escaped bankruptcy for the second time.
There was a lot of coming and going on the executive floor, and in ten years the airline had ten different bosses.It was saved at the expense of passengers and staff.Accordingly, the reputation was: whether late flights, misguided luggage or complaints from dissatisfied passengers, Continental formed the bottom of the ten largest US airlines. «From worst to first» with a Texaner1994 the 53-year-old Gordon Bethune from Boeing came to Continental and claimed afterA few months the left seat in the cockpit of the leaning airline.
Bethune is a pilot itself and licensed for the types 767 and 757 as well as for the DC-3.He also knows his way around as an engine mechanic.Before moving to Continental, he was responsible for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in Renton for the Baumston 737 and 757 since 1988.
Bethune had previously gained experience in the management of airlines at Braniff, Western Airlines and Piedmont.The self -confident Bethune brought Continental to a new course and created a much -noticed turnaround within three years.He gave this story in a book with the unexcited title “From Worst to First” *.
Together with the 34 -year -old consultant Greg Brenneman, he designed the rescue plan for Continental, which she called "Go Forward Plan".The two managers of their airline put four destinations.With “Fly to Win” they wanted to free the backpacker image and regain fully paying business travelers with better coordinated airplans and better service.
The tariffs were increased so far that they were cost -covering, and routes that could not be operated profitably. "Fund The Future" was the name of the program for new investments on the customer front, especially for the fleet and the terminals.To this end, the company had to convince its donors of the new plans and gain new funds for the investments.In your own house, too, the stereotypical sinking of the costs and salaries was used and, for example, successfully invested in new yield management and new reservation systems. "Make reliability a reality" was the ambitious third goal.
Continental should advance among the top five in the punctuality and satisfaction of the passengers in the ranking of the American Ministry of Transport as the previous light of the ten large American airlines.As a bonus, the management suspended $ 65 per employee.This quickly gave the airline closer to a central goal: to fly passengers with luggage safely and on time where they want to go.
Continental achieved this goal in the third quarter of 1995.The costs for the bonus to all employees were only half as high as payments for late passengers in earlier years.The fourth goal “Working Together” was aimed at the staff.
Only if it succeeds in motivating the 30,000 employees again after the ups and downs of the past ten years and awakening the belief in the success of the turnaround.That is why the employees have been involved in the company's success for four years.The approximately 43,000 employees flowed at $ 270 million.
New routes and aircraft 1994/95 Stand Continental financially at the critical point with the tenth annual loss in a row.But with the help of the economy and the gripping measures, the airline flew into the black in 1995.Since 1996, the airline showed a net profit three times in a row, which was over $ 300 million.
The airline and its managers entered this comeback from Continental.Then Bethune tackled medium -term projects.At Continental, ten different aircraft types were used in the bad times.
The former Boeing Manager Bethune ordered for the short and medium-sized planes over 100 aircraft of the types of Boeing 737- 700/-800 «Next Generation» and 757. For intercontinental traffic, Continental temporarily put five further DC-10- 30 in operation in 1997,at the same time ordered 36 Boeing 767-400 and 8 Boeing 777, with which the DC-10 fleet is replaced.The flexible five -year plan allows continental growth up to 2.8 % in internal American traffic and an increase in capacity of up to 8.2 % in international traffic.
At the turn of the millennium, the fleet of Continental will compose 60 % of Boeing 737 of the series -300/-500/-700 and -800, which allows considerable savings in operating and maintenance costs.Continental is particularly intercontinental on a steep growth course.This summer alone, the company increases its capacity in traffic with Europe and the Middle East by a third.
In addition to the daily flight New York / Newark-Zurich from June, Brussels will also be added to the route network from August and from August Tel Aviv.The Hubs Paris, Frankfurt and London are flown to with the new Boeing 777 from Houston and Newark.Continental is one of those airlines that only offer two classes in intercontinental traffic.
Today Continental is the fifth largest airline in the United States and the eight largest worldwide, measured by the passenger miles (1997).It offers more than 2,200 flights to 128 American and 79 international destinations every day.The New York-Zurich route gave up difficult Swiss Market Merican Airlines two years ago because, according to her President Don Carthy, she cannot keep up with the Atlantic Excellence from Swissair and Delta.
Continental, in the USA with Northwest, has entered alliances with Alitalia and Air France, but is a lone fighter in Switzerland.On the one hand, one relies on passengers who have previously been flown to the United States from Switzerland via other European hubs.On the other hand, it is believed that the two financial centers New York and Zurich could generate a sufficient volume on business trips.
With Newark, according to its responsible person in Switzerland, Claudio Grass, Continental has a hub with connections within the USA and Mexico.Deep prices are planned for June in Economy Class to make Continental.For the Business First Class, on the other hand, the quality of the product is rely on and does not provide for any special conditions at the start.

Protect to death / / "controversial expansion, TA from the 24th 2nd flight traffic and its noise pollution is very uncomfortable and can undoubtedly become a real plague depending on the place of residence. The fact that the protection association is the right instrument to solve the noise pollution of the population is shownaccording to his latest demands.
The almost ingenious demands for a further restriction of flight movements, the expansion of flight locking times, the ban on loud large aircraft, e.g.B. the Boeing 747 or the MD 11, "" "the solution to the problem" "represent.With the implementation of such "" "balanced" "demands, the airport Zurich will have to set the company safely in the medium term.This solves all problems - where nobody can start and land for economic reasons, no more noise arises - at least no aircraft noise.
The resident population around the airport can finally sleep undisturbed again and enjoy the "" unique calm "" in the Zurich lowerland.The fact that we then no longer have a airport, have to fly somewhere else business or holidays, have buried the international connection of our region itself, are of course admittedly small blemishes - we finally have the calm that we also deserve!The operation has succeeded and the patient is finally dead.
The protection association has performed its task - Bravo.The only problem that we still have is the protection association itself - it has become unemployed.Peter Utzinger, Bülach "" Economic Council "," notes the commentator, "" dictated...
The framework of aviation "".This profane knowledge applies to every industry that pays wages and contributes to the economic prosperity of a region.In the communities around Zurich Airport, tens of thousands of people live at least indirectly from wages or orders from the airport companies.
Many residents have understood the causal relationships, and in the higher interest of good, safe jobs - which they may even have moved to the airport region - they accept an inevitable level of immissions.Airlines and aircraft manufacturers have invested huge amounts in the enormous technological advances that have significantly reduced the stress due to noise and exhaust gases.Modern commercials are worlds from, for example, the jets that the military air freight (Dübendorf) uses.
People around Zurich Airport are entitled to ensure that air traffic takes place with the most modern, environmentally friendly aircraft and the use of such machines is effectively controlled by a corresponding fee schedule: Economic constraints as a steering instrument, Zurich Airport is a leader.However, it is incomprehensible to me that the fragile acceptance of what is necessary for the economically necessary is endangered by the tolerance of unnecessary splash flying.For security, capacity and environmental protection reasons, private flights do not belong to a transport airport according to visual flight regulations (VfR).
After all, you don't let any trottinetts on the highway.Ralf Etzold, Winkeldie Beautiful keywords from the national importance of the Swissair, from its key point for the Swiss economy could also be replaced by the keywords "my bank account" "or" "My wallet" ".People (I adorn myself to use people here) don't live in the catchment area of the airport anyway, but maybe on the gold coast, somewhere in the canton of Schwyz or in the canton of Zug.
It is time that the people who are the residents of the airport together and really do something about it - they should not leave the word leadersResidents can count - they should finally compete against politics and the politicians and definitely demand a stop every further expansion of the airport and air traffic in this region.It is simply not true that the Swiss economy is based on Swissair and without huge air traffic in the Zurich region - the economy has always understood to search and find solutions.These are also easy:
Switch to the train for routes such as to Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, Milan, etc., fewer flights also for holiday guests, more expensive kerosene, cost-appropriate ticket prices, in particular the use of the transmission options available today (fax, internet, etc.).The statements that the expansion of the airport creates further jobs and enables the construction industry are also eyewashing - the expansion comes to an end, and the construction industry has to talk to today's needs.Maurus A.

Difficult search for the stress boundaries / / With the determination of stress limit values for the noise of the state airports, the federal government wants to set the framework for the development of air traffic and create the basics for the control of future structural design of the airport regions.The area of tension is not free of economic considerations.
The search for balance is more difficult than expected. Asp.On November 23, 1973, the federal government issued a regulation on the noise zones of the three country airports.A look at the settlement card, however, shows that the zone plans developed in a lengthy process have had little effect.
The Environmental Protection Act, which has been in force since April 1, 1987, has laid a new basis for settlement control, with the associated noise protection regulation, which determines the corresponding stress limit values for all noisy forms.The Federal Council used the Federal Commission to assess the assessment of noise immission limit values to develop the decision -making bases.In September 1997, she presented the stress limit values for the noise of the airports together with her recommendations in September 1997.
The stress limit values are divided into planning value, immission limit and alarm value.These are calculated for a 16-hour day value (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and 3 night hours (10 to midnight and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.).In order to take into account the different need for rest in the individual usage zones, the noise protection regulation distinguishes four sensitivity levels, while three zones were eliminated in the previous noise zone plans.
For the 16 hours of daily hours, the federal commission proposed immission limit values of 55, 60, 65 and 70 LR in DB (A) for the four sensitivity levels.The following values should apply in the individual sensitivity levels: 45, 50, 55 and 60 lr.It should be noted that the first night hour from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. in level II is increased by 5 dB (A).
This avoids the dominance of the first night lessons regarding the spatial planning restrictions of the noise -affected areas.In contrast, to protect a sufficiently long and uninterrupted night rest between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.Objections of the Swissairdie Swissair, which is very aware of the value of a good neighborhood, has long recognized the need for protection of the population.
She also made billions in investments in one of the world's most modern aircraft fleets with heavily lowered environmental pollution.However, Swissair encounters the officially proposed limit values with great skepticism.It has therefore created her own project group and, for the scientific support, was involved in the Carl Oliva office, basic sociological research and development planning.
The basis for the argumentation of the Swissair forms recognized scientific field studies that show that very different people react very similarly.It can be assumed that health consequences can be expected in the case of sound emissions over 70 LeQ.Now, however, the “noise study 90” commissioned by the national research program 26 (NFP 26) for disorders of communication in the living area shows a threshold area that is between 67 and 69 LeQ in DB (A).
According to the Swissair, an immission limit of 65 dB (a) (for the hours of the day) can be justified from this, which can be assigned to sensitivity level II, which comprises a large part of the residential area.The Swissair goes one step further: it wants to merging sensitivity levels II and III because the whole area around airports is ultimately noise.
In the further case, the Swissair turns against the equality of street noise with aircraft noise.It has been proven that different types of noise have a different annoying effect with the same load.In the living room, a traffic noise of 65 decibels is perceived more disturbing than an equally strong aircraft noise.
In order to enable meaningful comparisons between the two noise sources, a annoyance scale must therefore be created with a correction factor.The investigations employed in the “noise study 90” lead to the conclusion that a bonus of 3 dB (a) is justified in favor of air traffic compared to the street noise.The difference is that the aircraft noise is significantly less disturbing and sleeping thanks to the night flight blocking regulations.
Night brearning is kept as a result of documents of the Swissair, the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication is currently being transferred to the existing regulation of the night flight locking regulations in the regulation on the infrastructure of aviation.The values proposed by the Commission for the three night hours are based on a critical waking threshold of 60 dB (A) on the ear of the sleeping person.However, Swissair now finds that the proposed immission values are not based on a sufficient basis of facts.
Most studies have been carried out in sleep laboratories, in which the sleeping people are played artificial noise events such as industrial noise, impulse noise and the like.Carl Oliva opposes field studies that were carried out in the apartment in the apartment who have a completely different picture for interviewed people.They show that with a current level of 60 dB (a) the likelihood of waking up or sleep disorders is only one percent of the subjects;
At 110 dB (A), this probability increases to around 8 percent.Captain Willy Kämpfer, head of operational regulations and procedures of the Swissair, found in a conversation with the NZZ that the horror scenarios (worst cases), which were very often conjured up in the past few daysthe population would be dispensed with, which is not certain.For the time being, fighters referred to the great technical advances in engine construction.
A graphic impressively shows the huge increase in noise in the first ten years after the introduction of the jet engines in the mid -1950s.Willy Kämpfer is convinced that the entire airport region and in particular the southern communities, which are heavily burdened today, can expect a significant reduction in noise in the coming years.With the sloping extension in conversation, the starting noise will be practically completely withdrawn into the airport area thanks to the higher riser power of the engines and the much reduced noisy carnival.
The mass for noiseasp.Because the noise pollution as a subjective reaction cannot be measured with instruments, a load measure is necessary with which the nuisance can be "mapped" as well as possible.So far, in Switzerland, the noise noise of the Noise and Number Index (NNI) has been used, which, in addition to the sound energy, takes into account the number of movements.
The equivalent permanent sound level LeQ in DB (A) is filtered, which means that the sensitivity of the hearing is taken into account, which is less sensitive to deep frequencies than to high.This is a pure sound event measure.The Mass LR listed in the noise protection regulation takes into account all noise events accumulated in one place with average intensity and calculates the mean value with a correction factor.

Fresh air over the clouds / / ell.Minus 50 or even 60 degrees and an air density that let us snap like a fish on land for oxygen:
Such inhospitable conditions prevail at a height of 10,000 meters.A sophisticated air conditioning system ensures that we feel little of this as flight passengers.She pumps air on the plane, puts a lot of pressure, heats and cools.
The source of well -being in the hermetically completed cabin is the engines.They are not only responsible for rapid propulsion, but also supply the cabins with air.It is taken from the compressor as a so -called "bleed air".
In it, the air flowing into the engine is increasingly compressed and finally inflamed in the combustion chamber together with a sprayed kerosene.Due to the high pressure from the compressor - in front of the combustion chamber - it already has a temperature of around 180 degrees Celsius due to the high pressure.It is cooled onto the desired room temperature in so -called climate pakets in so -called climate pakets.
In theory, the supply of 100 percent fresh air would be possible, but the airlines look at it.The fresh air prepared by the climate pakets is mixed up from the cabin at Swissair a maximum of 50 percent.Before that, it is filtered, although even tiny particles like bacteria get stuck.
The mixture makes sense for everyone.On the one hand, very good air quality is achieved - better than in many places on the ground, for example in most offices - on the other hand, energy is saved because the engines do not withdraw too much compressed air and their performance is impaired.Some airlines have also installed ozone converters.
Because cold air has very low relative moisture, the air on board is also extremely dry.Humidifiers, as we know them for better living climate, are not possible on commercial aircraft;The necessary amount of water would be too big and too heavy.
The moisture would also condense on the cold cabin walls and also drip on the passengers.Experts also warn of the risk of corrosion.The air pressure in the cabin is just as important as pleasant temperatures.
It is kept at a value at larger heights by means of a adjustable discharge valve that corresponds to a maximum of 2400 meters of sea level.The lower air density is already problematic for people with breathing diseases.Oxygen is often the only solution here.
A higher cabin pressure is not built up because it would make the difference to pressure too big.The result would be too strong stress on the aircraft structure.If the cabin pressure is suddenly falling below a certain value due to a disturbance, the crew initiates a rapid descent at a height of 3000 meters.

This writes his defender Stefan Suter in a press release on behalf of Werner K. Rey.On the one hand, it was a consortial loan recorded by the Omni Holding in 1986 and fully paid in 1988 and on the other hand a fixed takeover of new owner shares by the Bernese Kantonal Bank on the occasion of the capital increase of the Inspectorate International in May 1986.The Omni still the Bernese Kantonalbank had taken "the slightest damage" in connection with these transactions, Suter continues.

A Zeppelin in the Expo heaven?/ / The Expo's tender for balloons and zeppeline reacted three companies.Because none of the projects satisfied, the management of the Expo has reached the companies directly.
Since the three -sea region is very flat, it is particularly suitable for transport with air traffic means.That is why the EXPO started an offer advertisement last November with the aim of using zeppeline, balloons or other airships as a means of transport between the different artplages.This would allow Expo visitors an attractive view of the region.
However, only three companies reacted to the tender.It is the American company Skyship Group, the Skyship Cruise company from Lindau Zurich's and the Aargau company Skybus from Schneisingen.However, none of the projects withstanded a precise examination by the Expo management.
So it decided to proceed differently and negotiate directly with the companies.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) sent the three interested companies a detailed questionnaire to get the lack of information.Two airships from Expo.01 are reported by two airships from the Directorate for Finance, Traffic, Environment and Tourism Directorate, two airships are ready for use.
There are still no documents that prove that the machines correspond to the international rules for passenger transport.The third airship currently exists on paper at the moment.Maissen is convinced that at least one of the airships are used on Expo.01.
Special approval and additional concessionhans Ulrich Aebersold, spokesman for the Bazl, declared that in Europe the joint aviation authorities (JAA) are responsible for the certification of the aircraft.This is valid in the 27 countries that belonged to the JAA.In order to be able to promote passengers, a special permit is then needed.
An additional concession is required so that a contract can be concluded with the Expo.The landing spaces for the airships are intended for an anchor mast to the mooring of the cantonal development regulations.For the Biel species, this is located behind the Erlenwäldli in the Ipsacher area.
A fifteen -meter -high anchor mast, which can be attached to a truck, is sufficient for landing.So that the stability of the airship is also guaranteed in strong winds, solid anchor points must be ensured on the ground.Now you need private companies that participate financially and use the airships as advertising medium.

A policy of the trimmed wings / / "In the sky, the Gau, at the Zurich Kloten Airport, threatens traffic jams- and politics is increasingly being wiped up between economics, ecology, civil and military flying. By Erwin Haasder
Suffering in the region around Zurich Airport grows and grows.Materiell waves increasing prosperity.But the quality of life sinks as quickly as the volume of traffic on land and air routes increases - and there is obviously nothing anymore.
The crowding-out struggle in the airline business is ruinous and allowed trips to London for CHF 49.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation expects a doubling of traffic volume over Switzerland by 2015.The forecasts for the flight movements in Zurich Kloten are continuously corrected upwards.
Measured by reality, even worst-case forecast tends to understatement.In 1990, 250,000 starts and landings were expected in Kloten for 2010.This number was almost reached in 1994.
Almost 270,000 flight movements were counted in 1997.In the meantime, 316,000 movements are expected for 2010 even without the expansion of the airport.When the system is enlarged, 420,000 come to us annually - or more.
Sometimes the impression cannot be defended, the politically responsible, above all, especially economics director Ernst Homberger (FDP), considered this growth to God.It is not so .We let it proliferate because almost everyone - including people from Bülach and Oberglatt - likes to travel to Bangkok and Chicago and benefit economically.
21,000 people work at the airport, 16,000 of them at the Sairgroup alone.30,000 others depend directly on the airport.Eight percent of the population in the canton are immediately dependent on the Zurich goal to the world.
Protection association in the defensive canton, which operates the airport with a federal concession, this fits well into the concept.The bourgeois government argues with the favor of location, just like the Sairgroup.This fears that it will have to outsource long -haul flights if the airport is not enlarged.
The expansion is urgently in the interest of the Zurich economic region, indeed the whole country.As for the burden on the environment, this traffic system is of national importance to grant the right to be louder and dirty than allowed.The residents of Rümlang, Opfikon-Glattbrugg and Höri have to dispose of their garden grill.
The airport protection association is in the absorption of the jets that thunder over its heads.He is not allowed to hope for help from the government and the cantonal council.Ernst Homberger is not even due to a problem in the air - he delegated the responsibility to the federal government.
The application in parliament to ask the people again due to the revised forecasts should not have a chance.All overall traffic on the country side is no improvement in sight.On the contrary: the airport wants to become a market in accordance with the market, which brings multi-traffic on the streets.
The planners want to increase the proportion of public transport.But they expect the Glattal Stadtbahn, which is not even planned.They boast the bike friendliness around the airport and are known at the same time, without an additional parking garage with 3000 seats.
Emission -dependent landing fees or not: compliance with the limit values of noise pollution and air pollution has moved far away.The wallet is close.The economy and the quality of life of the residents: This is one, by no means solved politically.
However, even more urgent is a second problem, namely the traffic security in the air.The air traffic controllers are at the stop.Already three years ago, an employee of the SwissControl air traffic control in Zurich said: "" Sometimes our first order goes, security, almost given the second task, efficiency.
"Nowhere in Europe is airspace as tight as over Switzerland - not least because of military flying.While the SwissControl privatized in 1996 tries to keep the nerves in growing excitement, the Air Force rests within itself as 40 years ago.She moves her billions of toy park and insists on the privilege of using the airspace for training purposes.
The military alone decides how much sky should be left to the room - as if the defense policy was still at the status of the Cold War.When the military pilots fly, the 15 -kilometer wide air routes of the civil aviation from Chiasso and Geneva to Schaffhausen are too narrow.Not even when Tigers and FA -18 stay on the ground - early in the morning, at night, on weekends, in bad weather - the airways reach the international standard width of 30 kilometers.
There are delays, which in turn gnaw on the argument of economy.The Swissair calculated in 1996 with delaying in the three -digit millions.Lufthansa alone operates 14 aircraft more than necessary to make up for failures due to delays.
And while the aviation is looking for shorter paths and wants to delegate air space management to pilots and digital electronic cockpits, military air traffic control usually takes the phone when communicating with Swisscontrol.A ball of interest in interest is suckled.Airlines and business demand more capacity and the expansion of the infrastructure, the air traffic controllers fear collisions, the residents around the airport want their calm, the Air Force insists on its controversial defense order, which peaceful experts describe as outdated, and wants to f / a-18-Fleet even increased by eight to eleven copies.
An international specialist congress in Geneva found priorities and smears in 1992, and the bottlenecks of air traffic were on the ground.Today it has become clear that there is generally lacking airspace in central Europe, and it cannot be expanded.Meanwhile, Swiss air traffic policy is exhausted in uncoordinated pieces.
Emission -dependent landing fees, soundproof windows, stronger taxation of keroses, quieter aircraft, faster trains for medium -sized routes - that's all good and right.But it takes a fundamental decision.An interest - economy, quality of life or the military - must be put on in favor of another.

Blick point Switzerland / / Flight accident avoidable?Sedrun - On July 25, 1997, the pilot of a Cessna from Grenchen wanted to fly to Parma (i).
In the Bündner Oberland he lost control of the icy machine at Cuolm Cingia - he and his three passengers died during the crash.The experts from the Flight Accident Investigation Office found in their report yesterday that a warning from the air traffic manager to the pilots might have prevented the accident.Tons of illegal waste lurring - away with it:
In the city of Zurich, unknown people illegally throw three to four tons of waste every year.The city costs the “wild” landfills around two million francs.City councilor Kathrin Martelli now wants to replace the sack fees with fairer financing options.
Student Auffahrschafhausen - An almost 13 -year -old student got out of the bus at the “Kegelgässchen” stop yesterday morning.When she wanted to cross the street behind the bus, she drove onto a van.The student suffered serious injuries when she was thrown away meters through meters and crashed into a distribution box.
Brummi-Crash: 2 injuries-rammed: at half past six o'clock yesterday morning raced on the A12 motorway, about 500 meters in front of the Gruyère Raststatz, an empty cistern car in a salt clock vehicle.The impact was so violent that the drivers of both camions were injured.

"" "Where exactly should I fly through?" " / /" For two weeks, the planes have been flying other paths across Switzerland. And many pilots still have difficulty with it.
By Liliane Leuenberger "" W i e is the navigation point?"" "The pilot has just received the instruction from the Zurich district control center to fly in the direction of" "Gersa" ", to the geographical point that is located near Gersau.The name is new and apparently not familiar to the pilot.
The pilot repeats his instruction patiently and shakes his head.Everyday life has been in the Zurich airport district control center for two weeks.Since the new air routing system has been valid, the air traffic managers have had to explain to every fifth pilot where they have to be carried out exactly.
So far, the aircraft flew in the middle of the so -called airways, but on different levels.Now aircraft often cross at the same height, but on direction -separated routes.Mostly .
Sometimes there is an oncoming traffic manager stared on his large screen, on which the air routes are depicted.Green dots mark every plane, and one of them flies on the wrong "" street side "".
An overtaking maneuver is in progress.Unlike in road traffic, the slower aircraft had to avoid the left to leave the faster.The reason for the zigzag course is that the Swiss air routes are narrower than prescribed by EuroControl.
The international standard is around 36.5 kilometers.The Swiss air routes are only a good 18 kilometers wide, too narrow for a "" overtaking lane "".The Air Force has priority, and it only allows wider corridors of about 32 kilometers if it does not fly herself.
Last week she voluntarily forego her entire territory because of the change.However, the narrower variant has been in place on Airway Zurich-Miland since Monday.Even if the Zurich-Geneva air road is shrinking to 18 kilometers wide, the situation could be difficult, says Anton Maag, the head of the district operations operations.
Because the delicate crossing points are at the beginning and end of this air road.And the summer flight schedule begins in three weeks, which means up to a quarter more flights.Dodging over Germany paths of the changeover has been restricted the capacities for the air routes Zurich-Geneva and Zurich-Mailand-but that means more work for those air traffic managers who monitor air space towards Munich.
There the new system will be introduced in one year at the earliest, and many aircraft therefore dodge there.The responsible air traffic manager gives instructions without a non -stop instructions without leaving the green points on the screen and the blue and yellow control strips with the data of each individual flight out of sight.An extremely exhausting job: a longer break is necessary about every two hours.
While the air traffic controllers in the district control center are slowly getting used to the new system, the tower, where arrival and departure are coordinated, is rather calm.But there are also difficulties here.The British Airways (BA), for example, starts and ends up using the old radar processes, while the other companies have switched to computer -aided navigation.
The routes of the two systems are not congruent."" We have to convert all data from the BA "," says Tower Center Andreas Heiden.An Lufthansa machine that has just started "" Possible Birdstrike ".
The responsible air traffic manager in the tower immediately blocks the slopes and offers the traffic service to search for the bird carcass or at most aircraft parts.Because such remains could later be sucked in by a engine.Meanwhile, a second of the four pilots in the tower calls the flight schedule of a helicopter by phone who wants to start in Dübendorf.
The plan is not in the computer system.Dübendorf and Zurich have to meet continuously.However, the phone is often unnecessary.
A push of a button is enough to inform Dübendorf that you want to start aircraft via the blind landing slope to the south.If a lamp lights up, the approval is granted.PICTURE

Elisabeth II was his first traveler / / vol.Inaugurated “his” train station on April 29, 1980.
On Tuesday evening, Walter Schläpfer, who headed the SBB train station Zurich Airport from the beginning, was adopted in the "Top Air" of over a hundred leading personalities of the airport, airlines and other partners.The station inspector, which has not yet appeared, had set itself the goal of making Zurich Airport the best train station in the country.The most gratifying, at least among the larger ones, has certainly become of it.
Thanks to Schläffer's initiative Heller as planned as initially planned, colored wall cladding shouts cheerfully, the cleanliness of the perrons and the station hall leaves nothing to be desired, luggage scooters were already available in a sufficient number in the airport station than was often dared to dream elsewhere, and andYou can tell from the staff that it is proud to be able to work here.At the switches of the Zurich airport station, you are served faster and friendly than usually, and if the SBB's fee -based 157 number once again refused access - "call it later!» -, Schläfer's team replied quickly and precisely.With CHF 38 million in sales in passenger and luggage traffic, Zurich Airport in the SBB ranking last year, just behind Winterthur and in front of St. Gallen and Biel.
Since 1981, the number of passengers from 3.8 to 8.7 million, the sum of the luggage shipments from 210,000 to 394,000 a year and the number of trains increased from 110 to 247 per day.Only the personnel stock has dropped slightly from 67 to 65.Walter Schläpfer, previously head of the information and travel agency as well as the ticket sales in Zurich's main train station, was able to influence five percent disobedient in 1979, when planning operating facilities of the then SBB district directorate III section, was able to influence the construction and organization of the airport station.
The one and a half years until the opening of the airport line, he describes his most creative time.He wanted a superlative train station, just as elegant and with as good performance as the Swissair terminals above.In order to get through with it, the military-strict service of the SBB, the “dirt road next to the highway”, was not always possible.
From Ulrich Bremi, Schläpfer once heard that innovation also meant five percent disobedience.He admits that it was sometimes ten percent with him.The suggestions that are initially classified as "overbound" by his superiors to provide the perron edges with a white boundary strip and divide the perrons into the A-D sectors have now prevailed at the SBB.
He did not bring the application to mention the new “Zurich Airport” train station in terms of international customers;But he was able to "sell" the idea of adding "Zurich Airport" with a plane with a plane in a glass of wine on the occasion of a visit to the construction site.Schläpfer soon noticed that the reception of high guests in the airport station for President Benedikt Weibel was obviously one of the more pleasant duties, so that waiting times were suitable for making wishes.
The world-famous Airport became the airport with his “Fly luggage” and with “Fly Rail”, the offers to give up luggage from Swiss train stations to flight destination and back.Connections are also noted on the general gazette of the airport station, and travelers are made aware of the departure of the airport trains by a warning tone.For state visits to caps with oak leaves, Queen Elisabeth II to be able to greet Queen Elisabeth II as the first traveler in the airport station, has accelerated his construction by around a month.
A bronze table next to the switch series is reminiscent of the visit.Like all state guests since then, the Queen has driven from the airfield to the station hall with its wagon column.The stairs to the Perron was laid out with a red carpet, but the queen preferred to use the gray escalator.
The Salonwagen Extrazug according to Kehrset at Bern had priority in front of all other trains.While the station inspector initially had to stay in the background, Transport Minister Adolf Ogi wished for his appearance at the forefront of uniform and a hat with oak leaves, even after this had already been abolished at the SBB.Walter Schläpfer, who took over additional tasks as Head of Passenger Transport in the Zurich Nord region, has started very well.
Compared to the "Star" Swissair, the railway was open, friendly and fairly included, fully integrated into all working groups and respected as a reliable partner.There will be no successor to Schmfer as a station inspector;Until the next reorganization of SBB, at least the airport station should work without overall managers.

For a factual airport dialogue / / The ratio of the protection association of the population around Zurich Airport, numerous municipal authorities as well as part of the population of the Zurich Unterland and the Middle Glattal to the airport, has reached a low point.This is easy to determine on the basis of the ongoing discussions, even if statistical values are missing for this claim.
There is resentment, but not everything that is expressed by representatives of authorities, parties and groups on behalf of the public actually corresponds to the view of the entire population.In the past few months and weeks, the emotions in the airport region have been rocked up.It is undisputed that a lot has stormed on the airport region.
The keywords should be mentioned: the upcoming independence of the airport, the forecast of the movement numbers, the new report on the environmental compatibility of the 5th construction stage, the fact plan for the infrastructure of the aviation (sil), which - inevitable - for a large part of thePopulation looks like a book with seven seals.The uncertainty is also nourished by the lack of the federal noise immission limit for the state airports that has long been promised.Then it can always be determined that the knowledge of the political status of the airport and the effects of the new instrumentaries in public is quite incomplete.
When revising the Federal Aviation Act, the protection association recognized the relocation of competence in airport issues from the canton on the federal government, but in realistic assessment of its own possibilities and forces, but not taking the referendum and leading a voting struggle.Now it is often overlooked that aviation policy is a matter of the federal government.The longer, the more the lack of a reasonably meaningful model for the future development of the airport will be perceived as a deficiency.
In other words, you miss the overall show that has been challenged so often.Many of the fears and uncertainties are due to an information deficit.In this regard, a lot could still be improved, with openness and honesty in demand.
The technical planning of the airport has achieved a high level.A significant specialist knowledge has been developed (which could also be used safely on behalf of third parties in the event of a separation).At the 5th construction stage, the individual building blocks will undoubtedly be put together to a very well functioning whole.
Nevertheless, the demand for an overall view is indicated because a standstill requires that future developments can be measured and calibrated.The last months of waiting for the Federal Court decision on the objections to the framework concession for the 5th construction stage would have been very well been submitted to develop such an overview in addition to the planning work on the industrial flame.Instead, worry was stared at Lausanne.
The new report on environmental compatibility shows an unmayed picture.But he has a deficiency: he is limited to the expansion project, which is approved in the referendum, for which the framework concession is available.
However, the extension of slopes 16 (“blind land slope”) is already under discussion.This measure is to relieve the south of the airport.However, the environmental impact report has been dispensed with (for formal reasons), however, because a project and a concession request are not yet available.
However, this exclusion of an intended expansion step affects the view of future developments.With these reserved in relation to the official airport policy, the opposite side is considered.One thing is common to the many critics around the airport: with apparent certainty, they affirm the need for a well -functioning airport for our economy and thus for the whole population.
However, the corresponding assurances become unbelievable if they come from people who require a restriction of flight movements to 250,000 a year in the same breath or can already categorically reject an extension of slopes 16 today, without having any extensive documents for the assessment.And if you are in the interest of our economy in a functioning and developing airport, your demands should also take into account the vital interests of the Sairgroup, which is willing to invest 5 billion francs in a modern, environmentally friendly fleet.It is right and necessary to defend yourself against an uncontrolled growth of the airport in the region, but the right amount of eye must not be lost.
At least it is to be demanded that "the transport facilities are in national interest", which includes the airport as well as railway systems or national roads, with comparable standards.Nobody would think it is realistic to request traffic -free “time windows” for motorways or temporal restrictions on the operation of the railways, although these two modes of transport also bring a lot of immissions of many people.But it's not about playing out the different types of traffic against each other.
The burden on the environment must be kept within limits;Noise and air pollution must be contained, and all organizational and technical possibilities should be used - whether it is about public transport in the country or in air or around the individual on the street.However, this can only be done on the basis of objectivity and containing and with a critical weighing of the demands of ecology and economy.
It is to be hoped that the airport region will find itself back to an important employer and a significant factor in the economy at least after the election period.Many of the spokesmen who have a loud criticism at the airport seem to have forgotten that there is a community of fate in the airport region, which not only has to accept stress, but also benefits from many advantages, which have obviously previously had a lot of positive effect on the development of the communitieshave .All of this would have to be taken into account in a critical record to be created.

Canada demands improvement in flight writers / / CJA.Ottawa, 10.
March das Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which deals with the investigation of the crash of an MD-11 Swissair off the Canadian east coast, has suggested improvements in the devices contained in the so-called black boxes.The flight data writer (flight data recorder) as well as the cockpit voice recorder that records the conversations in the flight pulpit - both devices in the accident machine had failed about six minutes before the crash - will be able to be able to be enabled in the future by two separate and also independent power sourcesto continue working in general energy failure.It is also proposed for the cockpit voice recorder, the recording capacity of which is supposed to include at least two hours, to create an additional emergency supply, which may be supported with batteries, to enable recordings for another ten minutes.
The aircraft crashed on the way from New York to Geneva on the way from New York on September 3 on September 3 had had a “Solid State” flight data recorder equipped with chips, whose recording capacity was 25 hours.The Cockpit Voice Recorder, on the other hand, was only able to record the conversations in the flight pulpit for 30 minutes on a magnetic band.The proposals of the Canadian traffic safety authority published in agreement with the American National Transportation Safety Board are also aimed at their sister authorities in Europe.
It is hoped that these formal recommendations will be implemented worldwide as well as the informal suggestions published in December 1998 on the cable inspection in the cockpits of the MD-11 aircraft.The apparently electricity -related failure of the two recording devices made it difficult to search for the cause of the crash.An end to the examinations is still not foreseeable.

Better "Black Boxes" required / / Ottawa.The Canadian Office for Road Safety made a number of suggestions to improve the "Black Boxes" (flight data writer and voice records) on Tuesday.
The Swissair crash disaster on September 2, 1998, where 229 people were killed near Halifax on September 2, 1998.The last six minutes before the crash were not recorded in all “Black Boxes”, which would have been decisive to determine the cause of the accident.There were similar problems in 1996 when a TWA aircraft crashed near New York (230 deaths), and in the same year when a Valujet aircraft crashed in Florida (111 deaths).
The traffic safety office therefore primarily criticizes the fact that both “black boxes” are dependent on the same power source.The office suggests that the aircraft designers provide different power sources for the two devices and generally a recording capacity of two hours.The cockpit should also have an autonomous emergency power system.
1999
After Halifax: New Black Box / / After the Black Boxes failed when Halifax crashed, the Swissair revolves its aircraft.Just the last six flight minutes before the Swissair MD-11 crash at Halifax are missing on all Black Boxes.
In particular, these would have been decisive to determine the cause of the accident.229 people died during the crash in September last year.The Canadian Office for Road Safety has now submitted a number of suggestions to improve the Black Boxes - the flight data writer and the voice recording devices.
Part of the Swissair fleet is already equipped with these new devices.New two power swelling Canadian office criticizes the fact that both black boxes were dependent on the same power source.
For this reason, it suggests that the aircraft designers should provide different power sources for the two devices.In addition, both devices should be installed twice on board in the future: once near Cockpit and once in the rear part of the plane.In addition, it is to ensure that the voice records in general have a recording capacity of two hours until 2003, instead of half an hour as before.
The cockpit should have an emergency power system that can function autonomously for at least ten minutes.SWISSAIR is armed after the Swissair fleet is already equipped with the new generation voting records, which have a recording capacity of two hours.
According to Swissair spokesman Erwin Schärer, these are 42 Airbus aircraft.On the other hand, the four Boeing 747 aircraft and the 17 MD-11 machines of the fleet are not yet converted.The Boeings are to be removed from the fleet this year.
The replacement of the MD-11 is planned from 2002.So far, the Canadian office said that the Canadian office was coordinated with those of the US office for transport security.
The US office has made similar recommendations to the US flight authority (FAA).If the FAA declares the recommendations to be mandatory, they will have to be respected by all airlines and all designers all over the world.sda

The protection association remains hard / / / / the protection association of the population around Zurich Airport rejects the draft for the Infrastructure of the Aviation (SIL) subject plan as a unsuitable basis for a balanced coordination of the planning of the state airports on the spatial planning interests of the airport region.The involvement of the essential effects of environmental pollution in a new design. Asp.
In its official statement, the protective association has violent criticism of the draft of the Infrastructure of the Aviation Subject Plan, which as an instrument of spatial planning makes statements about the goals of Swiss aviation policy as well as to vote on spatial planning (settlement, landscape, transport and care) and at the same time the frameworksets for the granting of the necessary concessions as well as for construction and operating permits.(NZZ 4. 2. 99). The protection association writes that the spatial planning aspects and the protection of the population would consistently treat the interests of interest as secondary and the extremely difficult spatial planning interventions in the existence of the airport communities were not taken into account.In view of the development of noise, the Federal Council is warned against supporting the official noise LeQ solely when assessing the interference effect of the aircraft noise.
According to the protective association, this one -sided view would "plunge the airport region and thus one of the most important urban planning future areas in the long term into an uncontrolled state".This claim is justified with the statement that developmental arrest must lead to a depopulation and the associated various demographic, social and cultural undesirable developments.Furthermore, it is emphasized that the Sil Lasse, in the current processing status, does not recognize a coordination with the cantonal structure plan.
The region has felt "abandoned and consistently revealed and consistently" abandoned and consistently "abandoned and consistently" since the 1995 airport vote in 1995.In the justification of the broad catalog of demands, there are also basic problems for aviation, whereby the question is asked whether Switzerland actually needs a hub (an international hub of aviation) so that the economy can prosperate.A distinction must also be made between state interests and those of the Sairgroup that are not identical.
The weight of the Sairgroup as an employer is relativized.A Zurich Airport, frozen at today's level, would be attractive enough for many other societies because of its proximity to the Finance and Service Center Zurich and its manageability, to create a replacement and thus many new jobs with a possible reduction in Swissair flight operations »The above -mentioned, briefly summarized, accompanied reasons for the claims of the protective association illustrate its hard, unyondly attitude.The already known operational claims are repeated.
This includes requesting after defending three two -hour breaks at the slopes and the demand for elimination of aircraft, which cause a sound level of over 92 dB (A) per single cross.(This would make the use of the jumbos and the MD-11 of the Swissair.) In the period between 10 p.m. and midnight and from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.
A special night noise surcharge of 500 percent of today's highest noise surcharge per movement may have to be raised for starting and landing.In general, it is required that the Sil should be based on a transport policy that implements the strategy of sustainable development and is based on the goals for the CO2 reduction of the Kyoto agreement.Furthermore, it is required to take the place of one -sided demand orientation (with steadily increasing number of movements) already at the federal level that the grown spatial structures around Zurich and the protection goals of the environmental law take into account and the municipalities of the narrower airport region open opportunities..

Carrel gives Müller some air / / "The Air Force makes room for civil air traffic. But this does not yet win the fight against delays for Swisscontrol.
From Bruno Vanoni, Bernam the two partners had marked their terrain the previous day: the air force would no longer restrict its training operation from Wednesday, its vice boss Hansrudolf Fehrlin announced at a media conference (TA from yesterday).
Civil air traffic control is urgently dependent on military-stressed airspace, SwissControl boss Paul Maximilian Müller replied in a radio interview (TA from yesterday). Previously, he grabbed the telephone listener and agreed with Air Force Boss Fernand Carrel the pronunciation that now the civilianAir traffic control provides some air.Specifically, the two conversation partners have agreed two changes to the new flight control system, which has been introduced across Europe since February 25 and has made massive delays: First, the two most important air routes over our country are widened by two nautical miles to the European standard of 16 nautical miles.
Second, until April 25, the Air Force, but Swisscontrol, should no longer decide when the Zurich-Milan Luftstrasse is narrowed in favor of military training.With the preliminary waiver of their legal priority, the Air Force prove that, contrary to different media reports, they do not want to hinder civil air traffic, said air boss Carrel.Swisscontrol boss Müller also explained.
Without a mutual regulation among the experts, the air force militia superior told the "" Tages-Anzeiger "", possibly threatened a decision at the political level, which "" "our partner Air Force had much more harm".Campaign against the military parried "" We received everything we needed or expected from the Air Force, "said Müller.
He rejected the criticism that had been raised in a "" Blick "" campaign.Müller recommended that the bosses of Swissair and Crossair, who had publicly put pressure on military flying, to raise their voice in the international committees.Because it is clear to him that half of the current delays are due to conversion problems abroad.
And that airlines that have become too late and insufficiently adapted to the new air road system for the bottlenecks that have occurred are also responsible.Certainly additional flights will lead to delays over the Easter days and during the summer vacation.Thanks to the immediate measures agreed with the Air Force, Swisscontrol will be able to master around ten to twenty percent more traffic, said Müller.
However, the problems with the introduction of the new system have not yet been solved.His air traffic controllers need two weeks to increase performance with the same security to the level of last year.The Swisscontrol boss also admitted that the staff still still too small despite the increase in the increase initiated and that the technical equipment was still in need of renewal despite new acquisitions.
In the long term, Switzerland will no longer be able to cope with the growing air traffic with traditional air routes, said Müller like Carel.The aviator boss advocated relocating civilian transit paths via the Jura and Eastern Switzerland.The military could do without the two training rooms there if its third practice room was enlarged across the Central Alps.
To this end, the Air Force should be able to train abroad, added Swisscontrol boss Müller to his military colleagues.It is clear to both that such a redesign of Swiss airspace is difficult because it requires the consent of neighboring countries, arouses resistance in their own country and also requires expensive technical changes.Swissair: collapse prevented.
- The Swissair reacted relieved to the decision."" We are glad that the situation is defused, "said press chief Martin Kaspar.The Air Force's full training activity could have collapsed the company at Kloten Airport, especially after the introduction of the summer flight plan on March 28th, which brings even more traffic.
Yesterday Tuesday, the Swissair in Kloten recorded 102 flight protection -related delays of 30 to 60 minutes each.In the medium term, additional measures are needed to dismantle them, said Kaspar.
He demands that the air routes will be restructured, the Swisscontrol is expanding their capacities and the foreign airlines fly to Switzerland navigatorly.In addition, the Swissair crews were prepared for the introduction of the new air routes on February 25th. (Smd.) "

Greens against noise carpet / / "The Green Party does not want to be permanent noise over the entire airport region and no civil air traffic at the Dübendorf military airfield. The Green Party Kanton Zurich wants to work for an environmentally and human-friendly airport policy.
Yesterday Wednesday, the Greens explained their positions and demands at a media conference in Zurich.Climate policy Respecting. Continuous growth of air traffic torpedoed internationally agreed goals to reduce carbon dioxide and the air hygiene renovation goal of the canton.
The airport holder (canton) and the Sairgroup would also have to comply with the requirements of environmental and climate policy, said Rümlang Cantonal Councilor Barbara Hunziker.The Greens reject the federal infrastructure fact plan because it represents a pure growth scenario.The Greens decide decidedly a spread of aircraft noise because the entire region around Kloten Airport should not become "" noise area just below the limit values ".
It is not important that the canton saves costs for protective measures with a distribution of noise and that the population has left behind.This is also the case with the so-called SIDSTEP approach procedure, which does not reduce aircraft noise, but only shift and thus overlook a new population group, said the Glattfeld cantonal councilor Susanne Rihs.The Greens also defend themselves against the planned independence of the airport.
This would delegate environmentally relevant decisions such as the further expansion or changes in the company to an administrative council and the democratic say.As an alternative, partial privatization would be considered for the Greens.The canton remains the owner of the airport.
The airport real estate company could manage them.With this form of organization, the Zürchervolk could continue to have a say in the legal law.Up to 1000 kilometers with the railway, the Greens, which fundamentally reject an uninhibited growth of air traffic, demand that no civilian air traffic is relocated to the military airfield.
Kloten should not become an even greater transfer of transfer, which in advance the Swissair makes huge profits in advance, the population only more pollutants and noise.The Greens want an overall transport policy that prefers rail traffic for routes up to 500 kilometers, later up to 1000 kilometers, said Winterthur Cantonal Councilor Felix Müller.In addition, the cost truth (offsetting the external costs) must finally be introduced, as a control instrument in the traffic sector.

Prison for crash pilots / / "Because they deliberately let two helicopters crash, two expilots have been sentenced to prison terms. Baden.
-The two crash pilots said before the Baden District Court that they had deliberately crashed in AMLIKON TG and March 1992 in Würenlingen AG on the instructions of the former helicopter Viktor Granella in December 1991 (TAWednesday ) .They allegedly want to have around CHF 150,000 each for their deed.TUI-AR AG received about CHF 4.3 million from the insurance company for the two helicopters.
According to the judgment published yesterday, the two pilots of the fraud or the assistant were guilty of attempts to fraud and misleading justice.The court therefore sentenced them to conditional prison sentences of 18 months and buses of CHF 6,000 and 4,000.A third defendant was sentenced to three months in prison for attempted fraud.
Together with the two helipilots, he had put a limousine in Italy into a gorge and reported the vehicle as stolen. "" Sacrifice of an accident "" The defender of the pilot responsible for the crash in Würenlingen AG described his client as "victim of an accident"".In March 1992 he started with the intention of letting his aircraft crash in front of the hangar of TUI-AIR AG.Before he was able to implement his intention, his machine unintentionally touched the hangar, whereupon he crashed.
His client should therefore be released from guilt and punishment.Granella himself denies the incitement for action.He denied the role of the helicopter as the client and, from the two pilots, asked for compensation of CHF 150,000.

Flight and other noise in airspace Switzerland / / / With the new European route system introduced on February 25, air traffic is to be liquefied.What promises additional capacities in the medium term has caused many passengers in Zurich, Geneva and Basel with delays and cancellations of flights in the introductory phase.
The project management raises a few questions.The passengers waiting for delayed departures grumble, the bosses of Swissair and Crossair rumblers, the Swisscontrol rumbles or calms down, depending on.The pilot groans, and for some media the Air Force is to blame for everything.
The transition from the old to the new European route system for air traffic on February 25 in Switzerland did not run through the taste of those involved.The Scandinavian countries were preceded by Switzerland and their neighbors last autumn - and had major conversion problems on their far less sophisticated air routes.Was it expected that the new management regime for the local airspace would immediately take a reasonable breakdown without breakdown?
Who knows what it went and is about, for him it is clear: no.The changes have not been introduced three traces for the stimulus of the new will.The increasing susceptibility to delay of air traffic called for years after measures to liquefy the movements in airspace.
The “philosophy” of the new system was recapitulated briefly.So far, traffic on the air routes, which were actually no ones, have been running from a navigation point to navigation point (mostly radio fire) in both directions along a thread, which required complex separation methods at the altitude.There is now directional traffic on the 16 nautical miles wide air routes, at the side of 16 miles, on the "road edges".
In the middle, each at 8 miles from the two outer "traces" for transit traffic, there is a third lane (track) for the drops or aircraft rising at travel flight, usually traffic from or after the airports in Switzerland orIn the nearby neighborhood.These aircraft, which change the flight altitude, require a particularly high control expenditure on the part of the air traffic control;It makes sense that its spatial separation leads to better use of the airspace from the constant transport in transit.
Part two of the innovation is that the three new tracks of course also require the definition of new (and more) navigation points.Now Switzerland has not been covered with entire batteries by new (and expensive) radio fires, on the contrary, the existing ones will be shut down soon after the turn of the millennium."Virtual" waypoints have taken place, which are drawn on the navigation cards and stored in the software packages of the computers in the cockpit.
In the first few weeks after the changeover, it has been brought about problems that throw a crooked light on project management in some airlines, including renowned.It happened that crews were conducted into one of these new navigation points, irritated, "repeat", and: "Spell".
The pilot had to switch to the old method, help with compass courses - and all capacity gains that the new system had promised were lost.Air Force to blame for everything?The root of all evils want to have found the "look" and relatives.
There was a day -long campaign against the Air Force, which is passing the facts.This is also confirmed by Paul Maximilian Müller, director of the SwissControl flight security company.There are conflicts of use between the civilian and the military side, because Switzerland is a special case in that the East-West-Korri Dor with 14 miles was created on part of its length more narrower than according to European standard, so it does not allow unsound three-track traffic-And on request of the Air Force can be reduced to 8 miles width.
This regime, as was presented by SwissControl and Air Force, has been exposed by April 26, as was presented by a comprehensive "emergency" press conference (NZZ from March 17, 99) by SwissControl and Air Force, that 16 miles of air road width is now being valid everywhere and the SwissControlAnd no longer decides the military side about periodic restrictions on civilian intercourse in favor of the Air Force.Even if this regulation should be charged for a definitive one: it will only solve a small part of the problem, and a "immediate measure", as it was shown, is just not.
Pilots now have some alternative space in which they can improvise, but a regular three -track traffic, which can be deployed autonomously by the pilots, will only exist after months if all documents are newly created and approved and the on -board software is opened.In any case, this will be long after the intelligence of the expected additional traffic in the summer months.
Hansrudolf Fehrlin, representative of the Luftwaffe commander and from next year his successor, points to two peculiarities of Swiss airspace: his cramping and the fact that there are more permanent rooms than abroad for military flight movements.This is the discharge of the militia system;The majority of the pilots can only be sent in the air during the published course data for training.
In addition, for Fehrlin, cooperation with Swisscontrol has proven itself as part of the flexible airspace management, which was introduced some time ago, and reduced a lot of conflict potential.Paul Maximilian Müller confirms this and admits in a conversation that the needs of the Air Force are an issue, but that there is more important influencing factors for the previous misery."We are still practicing";
The SwissControl must first be familiar with the new system.And because the neighbors do this (Germany only changes at the end of the year), the bottlenecks in Brussels in Brussels add up with consequences for the entire continent.After all, there may be significant increases in performance in the course of weeks.
Another bottleneck is Zurich Airport for Müller, with the regulation that is valid from the week after next, that from 9 p.m. there is only one departure slope available.In 2003, strong improvements are likely to bring a modernized instrument for the pilots.Limited resource
Airspace the impression remains that the introduction of the new air road structure has not been planned and implemented everywhere with the necessary foresight.Only a part of the problems are homemade because they are fitting a Europe -wide project.Nevertheless, some questions arise which (also) the Swiss air traffic participants affect.
At the Sair Group, is it certain that the passenger - possibly at the expense of flight schedule - is served if the volume of movements is increased by around 20 percent by flight change on March 28th?How serious are flight schedule meant, according to which several courses should go on the track in the same minute, with the shorter, almost unnecessary transfer times?In view of the limited resource of airspace, is there a boundary for further networking - intended in the dimensions of the industry - every small town that has a roller train?
Finally: The Swissair's wrath of not enforcing a clear referendum, regarding the expansion of the Zurich airport, is justified and understandable.But how helpful are threats with the outsourcing of long -distance traffic to Brussels and Milan?Do customers follow without further ado?

Airport complaint without opportunities / / 214th and 215th session: Monday, March 22, 8 a.m. 3 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. President: President Kurt Schellenberg (FDP., Wetzikon) HR.The government council is submitting the new personnel regulation to the Council.
The decree regulates the execution of the personnel law, which is approved by the voters last autumn, for employees at the state administration and the administration of justice.The law comes into force on July 1 of this year.Thomas Isler (FDP., Rüschlikon), President of the Presenting Commission, explains the regulation.
The municipalities are affected in that they do not create their own regulations.So it hurries with this template, as well as with the enforcement ordinance that the government has not yet passed.The communities need to know why.
The question of personnel qualification, in particular downgrades and the halving of the grade, has to talk, which should not be introduced now.The municipalities can introduce half levels if they want.Benedikt Gschwind (Ldu.
, Zurich) supports the regulation.Section 52 provides a ban on disadvantage for employees who are a member of the recognized personnel associations.
What's it all about ?Willy Haderer (SVP., Unterengstringen) points out that the municipalities can also introduce half wages.It only needs a decision by the responsible authority.
It is a shame that the canton does not use half a step.President Eric Honegger comments on Section 52 (2): HR representatives should not be allowed to abuse their position, hence the term "properly".
On the half of the wage levels: the personnel associations, on the other hand, opposed and the government has given up.Thomas Büchi (Gp., Zurich) does not understand, which is why § 52 found the word "properly".Let's delete that!
District President Honegger does not want to enter this.The matter is adopted and time is pushing.It is undisputed.
The Council passes the template with 130 against 1 voice.The adjustments to overriding law are approved with 130 to 0 votes.Self -rental value egloff (SVP., Aesch) reads a faction's explanation.
The seniors have to swallow a bitter pill with the new tax law.The increase in the rental values is unacceptable for us.Apparently the state is only concerned with generating new tax revenue.
The government's scope for action would have been greater.What about the constitutional mandate of the home ownership funding?Germain Mittaz (CVP., Dietikon) has also taken note of the new property taxation, as he recorded in a declaration of parliamentary with a parliamentary declaration.
We have a historical high.Home owners are punished in every respect.Thomas Büchi (Gp., Zurich) is behind the new property taxation.
The Federal Supreme Court decided;The government was not free to determine the values.The federal tax harmonization applies.
The “Matter” Balz Hösly case (FDP., Zurich) criticizes public statements by Crista Weisshaupt (Sp., Zurich), member of the business examination commission, in the so -called Matter case.Ms. Weisshaupt violated the guiding principle of the GPK.We condemn the fracture of confidentiality that must be stated here.
The cantonal council's office apparently did not feel that it felt like it was immediately.We ask the SP to withdraw Ms. Weisshaupt from the GPK.The office is supposed to create transparency.
Willy player (sp., Küsnacht) replicates on Hösly.The rules were actually not observed, and Ms. Weisshaupt apologized.There can be no question of a violation of official secrecy within the meaning of the Cantonal Council Act.
Ms. Weisshaupt did not say more about the Matter case than was in the press release of the police department.The case is done for us.The chairman announces that the office against Ms. Weisshaupt has submitted a criminal complaint against a possible violation of the official secret (see separate report). Expansion of the legal institute's government council requests a loan of CHF 25.9 million for various structural measures at the Rämistrasse university building74, which houses the legal institute.
The project essentially includes the creation of new courtyard installations, the increase in the building and the renewal of the technical systems, such as Ulrich Isler (FDP., Seuzach), President of the Preliminary Commission.The legal institute is now spread over seven properties.The personnel substartation at the institute is not a financial problem, but a space problem.
100 students come to a professor.The mismatch is obvious.The house is a cantonal protective object.
The renovation and maintenance of the existing building would be about as expensive as the planned new buildings.The costs are high, but understandable.The cost calculation seems absolutely reliable to us.
The operation must be maintained during the construction phase;This is more expensive.Claudia Balocco (Sp., Zurich) supports the project with her faction, as well as Vilmar Krähenbühl (SVP., Zurich).
Both votants criticize the mixture of bound and unbound editions, which leads to a certain lack of transparency.The lack of a room concept for the entire university also gives rise to criticism.From the point of view of the GPK, Franziska Frei-Wettstein (FDP.
It still lacks the transparency.The FDP supports the template, as well as Felix Müller (Gp., Winterthur).Peter Bielmann (CVP., Zurich) joins, as well as Werner Scherrer (Evp., Uster).
Astrid Kugler (Ldu., Zurich) also tries to find a "hair in the soup".
We find the architecture very successful.Government Councilor Ernst Buschor states that the template meets the provisions of the Financial Budget Act.We are about checking the university's spatial planning.
Professors who work privately in their offices are subject to compensation compared to the canton.Ruedi Hatt (Fdp., Richterswil) demands cost controlling.We find a cubic meter price of around CHF 1,000 very high.
It must be clear to the other cantons what a study place at our university costs.The central local services must be visible.The Council passes the template with 124 to 0 votes.
Complaint to the airport expansion Non -folk vote on the execution of the 5th construction stage at Zurich Airport of June 25, 1995 cantonal councilor Helen Kunz (Ldu., Opfikon) and co -signer complained against the referendum.The complainants apply for the referendum to be declared and repeated afterwards due to "deception of the voters".
The government council assumes that he had given the maximum capacity of the airport too deeply in the run -up to the referendum against better knowledge in order to underline the need to remove the airport towards the voters.The government also suggested to the cantonal council with reference to the master plan at the time; the 5th construction stage would not have reached the capacity of 250,000 flight movements per year, which was fully extended, the airport was not yet extended.In the fall of 1998, on the other hand, there were operated on with other numbers:
The number of 290,000 movements of line and charter traffic and 25 million passengers was mentioned as the maximum capacity of the 4th expansion stage;As a maximum of the 5th expansion stage, the numbers were corrected to 400,000 movements and 36 million passengers.Based on these recent numbers and forecasts, a conscious deception of the sovereign at the time.
The prehistory of the airport expansion enlighten that those responsible had already relied on the political feasibility of a future airport expansion from 1990;You would therefore not have tried correct forecasts.The Cantonal Council's office, for which Thomas Dähler (FDP., Zurich) spoke on, requests the dismissal of the complaint.
Formally, the complaint has been filed (around 3 years);Nevertheless, the complaint can be checked for your material salary in the sense of a request for revision.There is no indication that the airport directorate in 1990 deliberately assessed the capacities too deeply to improve the political feasibility of a loan template, which should only be coordinated five years later.
The complainants are practicing in allegations on this point.The requirements underlying the master plan 92 are no longer comparable to today's condition.With the introduction of the so -called 4th wave from 1996/97 and the associated release of slopes 16, the situation has changed fundamentally.
The 4th wave resulted in around 16,000 additional flight movements per year.However, all of this was not foreseeable at the beginning of the nineties, as the complainants claim.Actually, this decision should be made by a court and not by the cantonal council itself, which will inevitably decide politically.
The constitutional complaint to the Federal Supreme Court is foreseeable.The complainants draw the wrong conclusions from the recent numbers regarding maximum capacities.Compliance with the noise limit values was the main discussion point before the referendum and not the capacities.
There are no indications that the people have decided differently, it would have been aware of the latest figures.Helen Kunz (Ldu., Opfikon) announces that, as a complainant, she will voluntarily take off.New conditions Willy players (sp., Küsnacht) justify the point of view of the minority, which requires the repetition of the vote.
It is not crucial for us whether the government did not say the whole truth at the time;It is crucial that the situation is presented very differently today.The people should be able to decide again, knowledge of the youngest figures that arise from 400,000 flight movements.
Today's system copes with 290,000 flight movements.At that time, the people assumed false facts that the government council may have spread in good faith.There is evidence that it was deliberately operated on with too low numbers, but there is no right -handed proof.
The fact that the noise load and pollutant values have been massively corrected upwards is also new.The deviation of the latest figures from those presented at the time is so blatant that a new vote justifies itself.Hans Peter Frei (SVP., Embrach) announces that the SVP rejects the complaint with determination.
It's about a new delay maneuver.The existence of many people in the lowlands depends on the airport.The complaint is undemocratic.
The people spoke.The complainants should pay CHF 3,000.
Thomas Büchi (Gp., Zurich) is the opposite view.The numbers and facts speak for themselves.They do not agree with those from which the people went out before the vote.
The Greens have always said that the numbers are wrong.How much false information does it take for a referendum to be repeated?Richard Hirt (CVP., Faltrand) notes that there is no evidence of the claims.
The claims are outrageous and suitable to undermine confidence in the authorities.Ruedi Keller (Sp., Hochfelden) speaks of the master plan 92, which is still valid today.It speaks of a maximum of 250,000 flight movements.
The promoters of the airport expansion always pretended that the airport from the last hole.Many statements by so -called experts then proved to be wrong.The airport had far from reaching its capacity limit in 1995.
Why did government and cantonal council believed the experts?Were there any agreements not to ask too many questions?The relationship network at the airport has become a felt.
The vote rested on the wrong basis.Competitive printing Kurt Schreiber (EvP., Wädenswil) does not believe that the government deliberately deceived the people.The Swissair was under an outrageous competitive pressure at the time.
Rolf Sägesser (Fdp., Greifensee) states a systematic mood of mood against the airport.The enormous increase in the number of flight movements in the late nineties was surprised.In 1995 the Swissair was heavily on Serbeln.
The Swissair acted actively and pressed the lemon even more on its own drive.The allegations are stupid and malicious.Other airlines have also had to revise their flight plans.
The change in flight plans has brought a striking over traffic that was not predictable.The complainants are concerned with prevention and delay.Rudolf Aeschbacher (Evp., Zurich) sees good reasons for a revision.
The people believed that noise and pollutant pollution would decrease;None of that is true, as is now evident.The exposure to the airport region through flight operations are enormous.
The loads are sometimes unreasonable.And now everything should get worse.The number of flight movements is said to increase by 75 percent.
People and stress can no longer swallow this increase.The borders have been reached and the economic arguments lose weight.Ultimately, it is not relevant whether the government has knowingly or unknowingly called too low numbers at the time.
The people should be able to decide again.We owe this to democracy.A word of the apology astrid Kugler (Ldu., Zurich) notes that the payments forecast in 1995 were even overtaken by reality at that time.
The claims at that time that the lemon at the airport was completely pressed out also turned out to be wrong afterwards.Today the airport copes almost 300,000 movements without investing in the expansion.The alleged reduction in aircraft noise has proven to be incorrect.
The people in the airport region deserved a word of apology.Hans-Jacob Heitz (without welfare, Winterthur) says no to this voting rights complaint.The number of flight movements has developed into an unimaginated extent.
What is the citizens' benefit now?Let's be brave and we step on the new!The government could work out a new template on its own.
It may not be possible than the one that will now end before the Federal Court will end.The sovereign will also agree to a new template.Oskar Bachmann (SVP., Stäfa) recalls that the preparation of the referendum was under social democratic aegis (hedi long).
Peter Förtsch (Gp., Zurich) criticizes the work of the prognostics.How can you be wrong?Or maybe you wanted to be fooled?
We also expect that a new vote would be in favor of an airport expansion.But the voting relationship would be different.Adrian Bucher (Sp., Schleinikon) has something about cheap arguments:
Everyone wants to create jobs.The only question is what costs.Rudolf Ackeret (SVP., Bassersdorf) wonders about the backward worldview of the left and the Greens.
The thing is decided.Martin Vollenwyder (FDP., Zurich) commemorates the zero growth discussions a few years ago.This should now end with one of the most important engines in the economy.
There are also people who get health damage due to unemployment.The success of the airport festival speaks for itself.Bruno Dobler (independent, Lufingen) speaks of a new political shadow boxing.
Air traffic is public transport that creates value creation and jobs.Thomas Isler (Fdp., Rüschlikon) turns against arguments "from the belly".But there are elections at the door.
The airport expansion does not need a new legitimation. «New Deal» Hartmuth Attenhofer (Sp., Zurich) regrets that no court of court decides on this matter.The opposite side is responsible for reducing jobs.This referendum should be repeated;
And the people will agree again, maybe even clearer than last time.Daniel Vischer (Gp., Zurich) has no doubt that the government operated with false figures.So there was an objective basic error, even if it may not have been deliberately brought about.
The vote should be repeated either way.The airport policy is located in a mess.A “new deal” is needed between the parties, otherwise the airport expansion will continue to be endlessly delayed in the future.
Willy Player (Sp., Küsnacht) repeats that the accusation of conscious misleading the voters cannot be proven.Economic director Ernst Homberger reminds Vischer that he introduced the “round table”.In 1995 the deviation from the forecast values in the flight movements was only 1.9 percent.
With 70 votes, the Council decides to coordinate under the name.With 86 against 63 votes, the council decides to dismiss the complaint.The closed factions of FDP, SVP, CVP as well as the parliamentary group of Swiss Democrats and Freedom Party vote for the dismissal of the complaint.
The faction deviating comments come from Liliane Waldner (Sp., Zurich) and Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur) that contain the voice.Markus Werner (CVP., Lower Glad) is called the complaint well, while Werner Scherrer (Evp., Uster) rejected it.With 82 to 49 votes, the Council then decides that no costs are charged for the procedure.
In the final vote, the template with 87 to 61 votes.The session is interrupted at 12 p.m. 30.Air freigher replacement traffic.
The government council requested the depreciation of a motion by Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich), who had requested planning steps for the creation of a combined goods system for Zurich North and the air freight traffic.In the report, the previous efforts for a combined sponsorship for a goods handling facility for air freight replacement (LEV) in the Rümlang Eich area, which is also eliminated in the cantonal direction, is pointed out.However, the government alone does not cause the LEV to be erected to the railway, the government writes.
Negotiations with the airport companies have shown that the railway companies are not yet able to provide economically interesting, qualitatively sufficient offer.It is their task to make the decisive progress.Investments of the canton in the cover infrastructure could support this process but not replace.
The realization of the system in Rümlang only arises when rail transport has proven itself in practice.There would be enough cover capacities available for the time being.Bernhard A. Gubler (Fdp., Pfäffikon), President of the Transport Commission, announces that the Commission will mostly join the depreciation application.
The train is too slow, too little flexible and too expensive compared to the street.The volumes in the LEV are temporarily modest to justify a new goods handling system.The SVP and the FDP faction joins the majority.
Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) explains that nothing of his motion is fulfilled.It is about quality of life in the area of airport.The Swiss people have impressively made it clear that the goods belong on the train.
The motion cannot be written off.In 2010, 8000 40 tönner would be expected, compared to 3000 today, i.H.One every 12 minutes.The implementation of a LEV system takes about 10 years.
So you have to start now.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) considers the relocation of the Lev to the rail.A combined LEV system would be problematic for landscape protection reasons.
The motion cannot be written off.Economic director Ernst Homberger points out that new solutions are being sought.It is up to the trains to present a competitive freight transport concept.
With the support we went to the limits of the possible.The Council writes the motion with 77 to 50 votes.Framework loan for the transport association
As reported in No. 5 of the NZZ, the government requested that the issue of new principles on the medium and long-term development of offer and tariff in public transport requests.For the timetable period from May 30, 1999 to June 9, 2001, a framework loan of CHF 621.2 million is to be granted to the Zurich Transport Association (ZVV).The President Bernhard A. Gubler (FDP., Pfäffikon) is its President Bernhard A. Gubler for the mass officer of the traffic commission.
The financial needs of the ZVV have initially increased and has recently dropped.The number of passengers has initially increased significantly and is now stagnating.The federal government relocates further loads in regional traffic to the cantons.
The mobility concept also causes costs.The ZVV's savings demands for Zurich and Winterthur transport companies and SBB with resistance.The required integral half -hourly cycle is at least not feasible at short notice;
The timetables 1999 - 2001 have been determined.The market share cannot be measured exactly and is not suitable as a control instrument.When weighing up costs and benefits, the cantonal council has always pleaded for the size of the eye.
One should refrain from discussions about the Wipkinger Viaduct and the wing station;In the meantime, SBB has withdrawn their projects.The majority of commission wants the Zurich Stadtbahn
North promote and support the two government templates.Alain Bucher (Sp., Schleinikon) explains that the finance commission was not available too few documents.The Commission disagrees whether the reduced financial needs of the ZVV should be welcomed or not.
The Commission does not apply for anything.Personally, we do not find the fiko report in this matter useful.Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur) postulates a lesser -delaying traffic policy, what is the responsibility of the federal government.
Important cost -saving measures have not yet been taken.Insufficient streets are an opportunity for public transport.The Zurich main station and the Zurich Winterthur route represent bottlenecks.
The short-distance air traffic belongs on the rail.It takes faster route, but also preliminary work.Werner Schwendimann (SVP.
, Oberstammheim) speaks of "balanced templates".The ZVV needs a certain scope for action and realistic goals.Leisure traffic Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) also demands relocations to public transport.
The strategy report of the ZVV deserves recognition.If the instruments for a success check are missing, they must be created.Leisure traffic also needs efforts, not just rush hour traffic in “strong” corridors.
Demand has been stagnating in important S-Bahn corridors since 1995 or is even decreasing, while in part in rural areas.It would be important to know what the public transport users keep from the offer.Talks have to take place between the social partners.
The funds for the framework loan must not be shortened so massively.Laurenz Styger (SVP., Zurich) wants to further increase the cost recovery degree of the ZVV.The subscription prices are already too high.
Director Kagerbauer is said to have said that he did not know what to do with additional means.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) requires a lower air pollution.The modal split of public transport must be increased.
The parking space must be managed at the destinations.Ecological requirements are also needed.Our parliamentary group supports the SP minority applications.
In view of the non -exhausted framework loan, the failed marginal hour concept is even more blown.In addition to the S-Bahn timetable, the fine distribution must also be right.Kurt Schreiber (Evp., Wädenswil) emphasizes that public transport is not a bottom without ground.
The continuous 30-minute cycle does not cost 70 million.The increasing vandalism requires the garage of S-Bahn trains behind barbed wire.Wrong strategyastrid Kugler (LDU.
, Zurich) calls for measurable goals.These are still not available.The variety of cost recovery alone is not enough.
It takes the integral half-hourly time on all S-Bahn lines.Incorrect investments such as the right of Zurich lake affairs the result of the invoice.The Effretikon Winterthur bottleneck must be removed.
The passenger numbers have decreased since 1994.The ZVV strategy is wrong.We apply for rejection of the principles to the government council.
Economic director Ernst Homberger wants to pick up the passengers where they are available.The path of the ZVV, which has been taken for two years, is to be continued.General price increases are not planned.
Customer satisfaction is important.We apply for the rejection of all minority applications.With the SBB, cheaper conditions and a target agreement could be negotiated.
No rejection of advice has been rejected to reject the principles to the government.The amount of the market share for the goals requests Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) instead of the wording that demand in public local and regional transport is increased to exhaust the increase in the market share of public transport up to 5 percentage points.The demand for public transport is to be increased by 2 percent in both timetable periods.
The votant underlines that the data is available.A traffic model cost more than CHF 5 million.The ZVV needs clear targets.
Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) signals support.Regula Ziegler (Sp., Winterthur) demands goals.Astrid Kugler (LDU.
, Zurich) recalls that the ZVV explained in 1995 that the market share was held.Ingrid Schmid (Gp., Zurich) quotes the air program.
Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur) lists what is evident in the area of influence of the ZVV.Bernhard A. Gubler (FDP., Pfäffikon) refers to the automatic passenger counting system.Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) argues with the microcensus every five years.
Astrid Kugler (Ldu., Zurich) inquires whether the passenger counting system still does not work satisfactorily.
Bernhard A. Gubler (Fdp., Pfäffikon) replies that the system has been tested.The application for stirrings is subject to 75 to 57 votes. 30-minute cycle?Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich)
Requests to strive in all corridors as standard seamless travel chains at the level of the 30-minute timetable.Dignifications like in the Furttal have brought considerable multi -frequencies.Kurt Schreiber (Ep., Wädenswil) supports this step.
Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur) notes that the unfortunate marginal hour concept led to the other extreme of this type of casting can.Passengers from Stuttgart to Zurich Airport do not want to switch twice.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) votes for the application.
Werner Schwendi Mann (SVP., Oberstammheim) goes too far.Lau Renz Styger (SVP., Zurich) is the same.Kurt Schreiber (Ep., Wädenswil) recommends call bus systems.
Economic director Ernst Homberger believes that Kurt Schreiber had argued near the marginal hour concept at the time.The majority of the commission is 72 to 58 votes.Astrid Kugler (LDU.
, Zurich) requested that the S-Bahn offer be redesigned by the end of 1999. Bernhard A. Gubler (FDP., Pfäffikon) replies that the offer for 2005 could not already be available at the end of 1999.
The Council rejects the application at 67 to 15 votes.Astrid Kugler (Ldu.,
Zurich) requested to reduce the downtimes at the S-Bahn endings to what is necessary.In Rafz and Niederweningen, the S 5 stands around 40 minutes each.
Bernhard A. Gubler (Fdp., Pfäffikon) does not want to interfere with the operational.Kurt Schreiber (Ep., Wädenswil) rejects the application.The Zurich-Thalwil tunnel will bring changes.
The proposal is subject to a large majority.Stadtbahn Zurich
Nordpeter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) applied for to set up a concept with a financial plan for the entire public transport system in the Middle Glattal (including Zurich North).We have to be able to say what else is necessary besides the light rail.Willy Germann (CVP., Winterthur) considers a special treatment of this region to be necessary.
Without investments, the significant increase in the Split modal of the public transport is not possible in traffic to the airport.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) postulates the expansion of public transport.Laurenz Styger (SVP., Zurich) does not want a bus priority as a "providurium". The application fails with 64 to 59 votes.
Astrid Kugler (Ldu., Zurich)
Requests not to develop the prices and the ZVV's driving export range, but to simplify it.The application is largely subject.Bernhard A. Gubler (FDP., Pfäffikon) explains that the majority of commission would wish for minimum requirements for the employment conditions for personnel in a socially acceptable competitive order.
Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) applied for to introduce a socially acceptable competition order from 2003 for the provision of driving services in the network area based on a normal employment contract.This is to be anchored in the target agreements with the transport companies.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) adds that the competition order should also be environmentally friendly.
In addition, minimum technical requirements are required.Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) withdraws his application in favor of the previous mentioned.The application Hunziker Wanner fails with 71 to 49 votes.
Marie-Therese Büsser (Gp., Rüti) requests that you anchor social and environmental compatibility and to determine minimum requirements for technical equipment and equipment.Economic director Ernst Homberger assures that the requirements for new buses are up to date with tenders.
The Council rejects the application with 68 to 51 votes.Peter Niederhauser (FDP., Valaisellen) applies to develop concepts and financial plans for the long -term expansion of inner -city traffic in Zurich and Winterthur and regional traffic, especially in the Middle Glattal and Zurich North and to initiate measures to secure the traffic area.The light rail is only a partial response in this priority problem region.
Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) does not understand the word "in the long term".The application passes with 61 to 35 votes.Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) agrees with the principles, Astrid Kugler (Ldu., Zurich) rejects them.
The Council is called the principles with 89 to 13 votes well.Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) requested that the framework credit to be set to CHF 647.3 million.Barbara Hunziker Wanner (Gp., Rümlang) supports this desire.
The Council rejects the application at 68 to 48 votes.In the final vote, the template is approved with 68 to 30 votes.End of the session: 5:30 p.m.
1999
No new edition of the airport vote / / PEM.The cantonal council has given a clear rejection of the expansion of the Zurich Airport, which was decided by the Zurich people with a two -thirds majority.With 82 against 49 votes, the Council refused to consent on Monday, a complaint submitted around three years after the referendum, in which the repetition of the urn was requested.
The fronts remained the old ones.While FDP, SVP and CVP virtually closed against the intentions initiated by Cantonal Councilor Helen Kunz (Ldu., Opfikon), it was practically unanimously supported by the factions of SP, GP, EPP and LDU.
In the complaint, serious, indignant allegations were directed to the airport managers and the canton or the government council as owners of the airport facilities.The voters and the cantonal council were deliberately misleaded in advance of the vote by operating on the intensity of the expected air traffic to “prove” the need for the need for the airport expansion.The number of flight movements was stated too deeply and at the same time it was claimed that the airport was facing insurmountable capacity bottlenecks in order to underline the need for the 5th expansion stage, for which around CHF 800 million was granted in 1995.
Due to the most recent numbers presented in autumn 1998, where there was now talk of 400,000 flight movements as a maximum capacity after the 5th construction stage, it must be assumed that those responsible had known better before.In the debate, which lasted over two hours, even the supporters of a new edition of the airport vote admitted that the serious allegations against the government council and airport directorate ultimately did not prove.Nevertheless, Willy players (Sp., Küsnacht) and Daniel Vischer (Gp., Zurich), who spoke of a basic or unconsciously brought -out basic error, spoke to repeat the vote.
The expansion at the airport would need to argue in the light of the latest figures, which put everything previously known in the shade, a new democratic basis of legitimation.Hartmuth Attenhofer (Sp., Zurich) and the lesser -free Peter Förtsch (Gp., Zurich) predict that the people will not resist an expansion of the airport even on the second attempt.The re -establishment of the plebiscit has the advantage that the airport opponents, who are known to do not hesitate to have each individual expansion trap assessed by the Federal Supreme Court, would be pulled away from the ground under the feet.
The majority of the parliament could not gain anything to gain this reasoning, but assessed the complaint as a new tactical maneuver in order to bring the airport expansion to fall or at least delay them.Rolf Sägesser (Fdp., Greifensee) and Hans Peter Frei (SVP., Emp.) Prefered the allegations to the government and parliament in all forms and said that the rapid increase in the number of flight movements from the mid -1990s was to the extent that it was extended, likeit had occurred, no one was predictable for anyone.The decisive part of the multi -traffic had the introduction of the so -called 4th wave from 1996/97.
At the beginning of the decade, even the most sophisticated forecasts had not suspected that air traffic would develop to such an extent.Last but not least, for reasons of legal certainty, it is not a matter of making the people decide again about something that has already been decided with a clear result.*BD.In the afternoon session, the Council decided with 77 to 50 votes the depreciation of a motion, with which Peter Stirnemann (Sp., Zurich) requires planning steps to create a combined goods facility for Zurich North and the air freight traffic and a loan template for the participation of the cantonhad .
The establishment of a terminal does not yet cause a changeover of the air freight rate traffic to the train, the government found in its report with rare clarity.In 2010, a 40-ton truck can be expected on average every twelve minutes, the motionaire said.Despite the extensive support of the canton, however, the trains did not complete it to develop a competitive freight transport concept, as Energy Manager Ernst Homberger explained.
The continuation of the consultations was the discussion that due every two years on the principles for the medium and long -term development of offer and tariff in public transport with the approval of a framework loan from the Zurich Transport Association (ZVV) for the schedule period 1999 - 2001.Council members as a difficult discussion with increased noise level, lack of willingness to listen to the arguments of the opposite side at all, less tactical championship and block -like coordination behavior will not go into the history of transport.An excessive application for seamless travel chains at the level of the 30-minute cycle in all corridors prevented a factual discussion of the question of whether a mere hour of the hour on S-Bahn routes was still competitive.
The majority of the traffic commission, led by Bernhard A. Gubler (FDP., Pfäffikon), prevailed across the board with their applications, which largely corresponded to the government.The framework loan of CHF 621.2 million also found a clear majority.There were almost 100 million more for the timetable period in 1995 - 1997, and CHF 694.5 million were approved for the current period.
1999
With the Canadians in good hands / / half a year after the crash of a MD-11 the Swissair in front of Halifax in Neuschotland, almost 90 percent of the debris of the 150-ton aircraft was recovered from the seabed.One continues to search for those parts that decrypt the cause and the course of the misfortune.
Hardly anyone expects a rapid end of the elaborate examination.An interim assessment is conceivable in order to be able to draw conclusions for preventive security measures at least from previous knowledge.Halifax, March 24th today knows a lot about the last minutes of the course SR 111 before the MD-11 on the night of September 2nd, 1998, around 10 kilometers from St. Margaret's Bay, smashed on the surface of the sea and 229 peopletore into death.
Even though both recorder - for flight data and for discussions in the cockpit - spent around six minutes before the impact.There was fire with a very large heat in the ceiling of the cockpit.Individual cables show traces of sparks and fire.
The Canadian investigation authority, the transportation Safety Board (TSB), could not yet find the trigger.One continues to search for parts of electrical installations, systems and the aircraft structure to localize the stove.Lessons from information leakage impression of the first few hours has been confirmed:
The sympathy of the population as well as fairness and professionalism, with which the accident is examined by the Canadian authorities, are extraordinary.Thousands of volunteers performed over 200,000 hours in rescue work and the care of relatives.Companies made expensive devices available free of charge.
Settlement and examination are characterized by high competence.Investigation manager Vic Gerden from TSB works with his team under the protection of confidentiality.He primarily treats needs and wishes of relatives.
Media representatives experience him as a conversation partner, who answered every question in a friendly manner, but no longer conveys a Jota than he can answer.Hall A, where cabling and systems in the cockpit area are reconstructed on an eight -meter -long frame, may only be entered in connection with the examination today.The media and the public remain consistently locked out.
After the information leak about the conversations in the cockpit in January, the TSB justifies the confidentiality defined elsewhere: a few jobs would be monitored as comprehensively as those of transport pilots.This represents a massive intervention in the privacy of those working here.
Especially in critical locations, it is extremely important for a cockpit crew that it can communicate freely without fear of disciplinary or legal consequences.Ultimately, anything else would be a fight for flight safety.Remote -controlled
Search of partial cheese lessons less professionally, the Canadian coast guard and the armed forces act.From the beginning, the Navy coordinated the difficult rescue and worked with all conceivable methods: helicopter, numerous ships, partly with heavy salvage machines, a submarine, divers, remote vehicles, towing nets, sonar and laser devices as well as the GPS satellite-based navigation system.The Navy of the USA also offered support. It was troublesome to find more efficient search methods, depending on the weather, size and type of parts to be recovered.
"We are now intensifying the search again," explains captain Roger Girouard, head of rescue planning.With the help of remote -controlled device, it now aims to use the fire area, especially when the weather is getting better.Divers are too slow due to the limited use time at a depth of 60 meters, and this work is also risky.
New sonar and laser recordings are compared to those from last autumn, differences provide important information for the search.Despite the only 70 by 30 meters tall, this is not easy: the sea floor here consists of a previous river bed with round, head -sized stones in the sediment, which are constantly moved by the strong current.
The search also complicates bad view of only 2 to 4 meters.The examination is monitored by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.It registers the safe parts and has not yet completely excluded the possibility of an attack.
The identification of the victims, led by the boss of Nova Scotia's forensic medicine, due to DNA analyzes, was the largest action of this kind worldwide.Gigantic puzzle die most wreckage with the exception of those of the cockpit are stored in the provisional hangar J and outdoors at the air force base Shearwater near Halifax.The 30 -member examination team also has its basis here.
Around 350 people are totally busy with the investigation.The debris testifies to the uncanny force of the surcharge: centimeter -thick structural plates were torn down like a piece of cardboard, chassis spins were broken several times, tires are slotted.Hardly any of the many floors have remained in its original shape.
Parts are stored in over 600 boxes, most of them have already been identified and sorted;However, many still have the “Unknown” label.SR Technics employees, familiar with the MD-11, help with sorting.
After each new rescue campaign, old and new parts are put together again and searched for pass patterns for hours;Here too with a focus on cockpit.The effort is great.
For example, to interpret heat traces, parts of the same material and the same paint are exposed to different heating and times.In order to achieve exact results, the parts are also put in the sea water for a certain amount of time.The TSB has the intention of recovering all wreckage parts.
In addition, a size: 270 kilometers of cables are laid in an MD-11 alone.So far, CHF 60 million Kostendas TSB has the task of determining the causes of accidents, identifying security deficiencies and writing down in a report.
This results in recommendations on how any defects must be remedied.The solutions are defined by authorities who have approved the aircraft and manufacturers.The TSB already pointed out wiring problems in December, to which the US Civille Affairs Authority and Boeing reacted immediately with control instructions to operators of the MD-11.
At the beginning of March, the TSB criticized the recorder and proposed to extend the duration of recording and improve the energy supply.But the Swissair itself also took measures: last autumn it switched off the on-board entertainment system on its MD-11 and Boeing 747 as a precaution, and the engineering department of SR Technics created a control program for the wiring in the bug of the MD-11 during the same period.
The TSB is supported by its sister authority in the USA, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), by manufacturers of the aircraft and its components as well as Swissair and SR Technics.The Swiss Office for Flight Accident Investigation (BFU) is also involved in the investigation.So far, rescue and investigations have the equivalent of over 60 million francs
Town. "Ultimately, a few grams of 150 tons of ruins can form the key," Avionik specialist Othmar Hummel, who, as a member of the BFU, also describes the situation at the Stadlerberg when investigating the Alitalia accident in November 1990.The reconstruction is complex and, last but not least, also dependent on happiness: can you find the relevant parts, and can you see something from your condition?
In addition to the situation in the cockpit, the knowledge about the state of the entire aircraft cell is continuously updated with the latest methods before the impact.In the past, traces of pointers in display devices were concluded on the position of instruments at the moment of impact.Because this is no longer possible with screens, today you tap the memory of computer chips.
The picture also completes itself more and more from many other indications.Increasing impatience for Willi Schurter, until 1993 head of the then Swissair technology and today head of the Swissair accident organization of SR 111, is the central question: Why could the MD-11 not be preserved from the disaster?
Like he not only waiting for answers from Swissair and SR Technics.At the meeting of a Swissair delegation with Vic Gerden, such questions recently were important discussion points.The interest in Zurich is also strong in a more intensive technical cooperation with the aircraft manufacturer;
Schurter hopes that despite different interests today, this will be possible for the benefit of flight safety.Place of the crash Schützenim Büro 520 of the provincial administration of Nova Scotia with the inscription Flight 111 you deal with the accident on a different level.The crash site should remain protected forever, you check the declaration of a sea grave.

Massive criticism of the protective association / / The protection association of the population around Zurich Airport rejects the supplementary new environmental report of the 5th construction stage for revision, whereby the application to grant the construction concession is to be refused until the formal cleaning of this application.The operational claims already raised to the Infrastructure of the Infrastructure (NZZ 17. 3. 99) .asp.
In its objection to the application for granting a construction concession for the Dock Midfield, the protective association raises a total of 18 demands.The objections are aimed at the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek).In addition to a lot of criticism of the new report on the environmental compatibility of the 5th construction stage, the most main desire for the operational area is mentioned: at each sloping end to compensate for increasing aircraft noise three times two hours of rest before overflowing from 07 a.m. to 10 p.m.;
No admission from 2001 for aircraft with a sound pressure level over 92 dB (A) per single cross-country flight (Jumbos, MD-11);Restricts new from 05 a.m. to 7 a.m. (starts only from 7 a.m.) and from 10 p.m. to 0.30 p.m.Massively increased night noise surcharges, provided that steering effectiveness can be demonstrated, as well as freezing the night flight movements on the current status.
It is also required to prove that the forecast flight movements can be handled safely with the existing slopes and flight routes system.At the center of the request is the examination of aircraft noise;In the introduction, however, questions of security are also discussed to a greater extent because, according to the protection association, the "now often overloaded flight control facilities" are already falling below the "naturally required security standards".
The protection association notes that the airport region is entitled to find out whether and, if necessary, what measures for the disaster are taken.The lack of noise limits more have the lack of stress limit values for the noise of the state airports at a time -delaying factor, which can hardly be countered, because only provisional and controversial values are available as a starting point, on which hardly any factual discussion can be built up.Incorrectities in the basics of the Federal Commission, which must apply for the immission limit values, prompted the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) with the consent of the Federal Office for the Environment, Forest and Landscape (Buwal) to propose their own limit values, which are two values higher than the half -official version.
According to the protective association, which does not accept these values, these corrections correspond to "political wishful thinking of the Bazl, the Sairgroup and the airport owner". Criticism is also practiced on the flying noise LEQ, which, according to the appeal, the reduction of the individual sound event (for example by lessLoud engines) too much weight, but the increase in movements, on the other hand.From this, the protection association concludes that all calculations of the report on environmental compatibility would have to be corrected upwards because the technological advances in noise control are continuously compensated for by traffic growth.The soundproof concept is also the subject of criticism.
The introduction of a noise management with new flight routes or the distribution of the floats to a larger area is rejected, which would lead to a less intensive, but all the more broad noise pollution of new areas just below the immission limit.Spatial planning considerations take a wide range, with the airport being accused of never “keeping his back free” to the airport, so that it had developed in an international comparison to a city airport.With a view to the air pollution, the protective association demands that the maximum number of movements or an entire emission plant should be determined in such a way that the cantonal air program can be observed.

Together against the catastrophe / / the plane crash from yesterday afternoon was placed in Wangen's weapons.But not the use of civil and military emergency services: they also work together in an emergency.
· Fredy Gasser Patrick Kappelerals lifts the Superpuma, the crashed aircraft no longer burns.However, the scene that the crash left left is devastating.
Houses have collapsed, petrol flows from a tanker, and in the background of close figures as well as from another planet: men from the chemical brigade.What is striking: On the same type of damage - according to the technical term - driving or standing vehicles from the military, the Langenthal base fire brigade and the Niederbipp hospital.
This is what part of the "Donner" exercise looks like.On the one hand, the prospective soldiers of the only disaster relief regiment in Switzerland, but also the cooperation with civil emergency services, are trained here.Exercise and reality of such an exercise: "that people do not mix practice and reality," says Urs Amiet, instructor and commander of the practice company.
A hair and radiation specialists would actually have moved out for a hair.But the purpose of the training is clear: "We want to create as realistic conditions as possible," says Colonel Hans Dickenmann, head of the training center for military disaster relief in Wangen.It does not bother him that the Langenthal fire brigade in Aarwangen is stopped by military bridge farmers.
"That is part of it." The whole scenery is also observed nationally and internationally attention by a group of foreign visitors: the assistants or office bosses of the military attachés accredited in Switzerland.The reason for your visit is the exchange of information as part of the international “partnership for peace”, which is also connected to Switzerland.It is also not only possible for national missions by the military disaster helpers from Switzerland:
They provided their help around 1997 in San Salvador or Greece in 1995.The smoke on the square has evaporated, the mood among the "injured" is a locomotive.The end of the exercise is approaching.
But the disaster relief regiment, where these men and women are divided, remains ready to alert.24 hours a day .365 days a year .

“Catastrophe” played through in the time lapse / / In a large-scale exercise, the cooperation between civil and military disaster organizations was tested yesterday in Wangen A / A.At the same time, the newly developed changing wheel container system WELAB was used. Marcel Hammelwangen A / A.
A plane crash caused great damage to property and demanded numerous injuries.In addition, there is an acute radiation through the dangerous freight and water pollution in the nearby Aare through expiring aircraft fuel .... With this horror scenario, this afternoon are around 170 members of the rescue troops in the exercise village of Wangen A / A.People from civil rescue and aid organizations have been “exercised” realistic.
Two main objectives were in the foreground in the temporary exercise: on the one hand the optimization of the cooperation between civil and military managers, and on the other hand the practical work with the new changing adealum system, with which the newly formed disaster relief battalions (Kata Hi BAT)are equipped.Fast military service 2:45 p.m., the Langenthal base weir was alerted by the exercise management.A short time later, the fire brigade piket and the chemical army were deployed on the damage place.
Participated in the game included specially equipped radiation protection troops, the Oelwehr with a lock on the Aare and the medical rescue service of the Niederbipp hospital, which took care of the over 30 injuries with first aid measures.The unannounced alarm exercise was unintentionally tightened for the Langenthal base defense by the fact that the crossing at the Aarebrücke in Aarwangen was delayed in addition to a bridge armor unit in addition to the program.The most modern tool of the second phase of the exercise was then used military forces with heavy equipment and the latest aids.
Around 170 graduates of the currently ongoing specialist service course for military disaster assistance took on the role of the in an emergency to support or.Dissolving disaster aid battalions.( See .
Kasten). On great interest in the numerous foreign military experts-the German defense attaché in Switzerland was present, Oberstlt Rudolf Hauke-came up with the new, in Switzerland for the needs of the rescue troops, alternating wardrobe system WELAB,which is equipped in its individual container units with the latest device and material for a wide variety of needs.In addition to a complete command center and a power supply unit, the system includes equipment for chemical and radiation protection operations, for water transports, for fire fighting, for use against floods, for environmental protection operations or for the medical service.The latter container is equipped with material for first supply of a total of 50 injuries.
If the WELAB containers are not in military use, they are stationed for civilian commitment in fortress watch units or at base weirs.They are also constantly waited there and must also be ready for use within 24 hours in an emergency.For the participants of the specialist service course commanded by fruit Hans Dickenmann, the “Donner” exercise was the end of the three to four-week training.
The people who have completed a rescue RS, a genius-RS or a medical-RS are completing the course for the special training for the new disaster aid regiment instead of their first WKS and are now integrated into the special task force.An injured person is recovered and supplied with first aid measures.With a nozzle jet wreck, the aircraft crash was shown realistically.
Photos: Marcel Bierikata Hi Rgtzum Newly formed disaster relief regiment essentially includes four disaster aid battalions (Kata Hi BAT), which, as a "fast operational force" to support civil rescue and aid organizations, intended in the event of a disaster or for missions within the framework of the Switzerland rescue chainare .Each kata
Hi Bat has its fixed material location (Bulle, Dagmarsellen, Mels and Bellinzona) and is ready for use with the majority of the team within 24 hours.In addition to the "normal" rescue battalion, the Kata Hi Bat is assigned a sapeur company with heavy device.In addition, there is the changing container system developed in Switzerland for each battalion

"Piccards" "Orbiter 3" "on world tour" / / "The most famous balloon in the world will be temporarily visited in the Lucerne Verkehrshaus. Lucerne.

The sky is a large construction site / / "Easter traffic is the first major probation sample for the new flight routes. However, the conversion of the air routes continues.
Until no more air traffic controllers need.From Walter Jäggi "" As I see, all listeners were able to find their place here in the hall without pilots."" "The director of the Eurocontrol airline, Arnold Vandenbroucke, welcomed the participants in the flight security congress in Maastricht with a moody remark that was only meant half -joking.
In fact, the experts discussed the question of how long air traffic still takes air traffic controllers.Away from the division of labor pilots, this is a different name for air traffic managers in a not entirely true reference to shipping.Just as the air traffic control is organized today, this professional group is responsible for ensuring that aircraft does not collect either among themselves or with obstacles.
To do this, you have the authority to give the pilots instructions on course and height.Once a plane is away from the slopes, the pilots hardly look out of the window, but all the more intensely on their instruments.The crews rely on air traffic control.
Many aviation experts have to lift this division of labor.Freeflight means the much discussed term.It means that the pilots themselves are careful and no longer let themselves be distinguished from a control organization on the ground.
Avoiding computers as a pilot's collisions argue that the supporters of the procedure argue that there are suitable technical means today, so -called collision prevention systems.The most important thing that is currently being built into all planes is TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoiding System).
TCAS is a on -board system that can do without help from the floor.It can receive and evaluate special radio signals from aircraft in the area.The built -in computing program then recognizes whether a collision course threatens somewhere and gives the pilot a warning signal.
TCAS is not easy.There are so many planes in densely flown rooms, such as around a large airport, which constantly appearing fake collision courses.For example, TCAS warns of oncoming traffic, although the oncoming plane is in a descent and will soon be much deeper.
At Eurocontrol you have developed a better system, Freer-3 (we want to spare ourselves the explanation of the abbreviation). In contrast to TCAS, not only the position of the other aircraft is evaluated here, but also its flight route.The computer on board learns where the other machine controls and thus comes too much more precise predictions of possible collision courses.
The system then proposes course changes - and only at one of the two aircraft involved.So it does not happen what happens to foot goers on the sidewalk: everyone dodges, each on the same side.
Freer-3 has already left the laboratory last autumn;The first real tests with aircraft were carried out over Germany.In addition to Eurocontrol, German and Swedish air traffic control, the airlines Lufthansa and SAS were involved.
It is currently difficult to say beforehand whether and when a system like Freer-3 becomes everyday life.The pilots weigh abvon
Freeflight concepts promise some experts a more fluid traffic.The planners of the airlines would like to set the routes of their machines themselves as far as possible.The air traffic control was also spoiled for the problems with the latest air road reform, is unnecessarily inefficient and brakes the flow of traffic unnecessarily.
The pilots would probably be very happy to not always have to wait for starting releases and the approval of course changes.But they are also aware that the air traffic controllers lose a good part of their work.Should the crew in the cockpit, which already consists of the minimum to people in modern aircraft, also transfer the task of getting air traffic control in the do-it-yourself process?
What do passengers say about automatic air traffic control?The experts asked themselves such questions about the flight safety congress.Even if a system change of such scope will of course be up to date in the medium term.
"" We may be thinking about it in 20 years, "said Philippe Domogala, supervisor of the EuroControl center in Maastricht.There are good arguments against the lifting of the air traffic control.For example, experienced air traffic controllers fear that the performance of the airspace will be more likely to decide than increase if the pilots should decide on the traffic regulation one day.
Because if every pilot looks for himself and your own airline, traffic as a whole can suffer.The air traffic controllers today are a neutral position that all competitors recognized on the air traffic market.It is rather doubtful that the pilots could agree on the ideal order when starting or landing.
And yet, Christian W. does not believe that the air traffic control will be abolished in the foreseeable future, the spokesman for the pilot organization "" Association Cockpit "".Of course, the pilots wanted to navigate as freely as possible, but on the other hand they should not be overloaded.Nevertheless, thinking emphasized at the conference:
"" There are already situations that the pilots would better solve themselves."" "He cited overtaking maneuvers as an example, which are often impossible today in European airspace because too many flight protection points would have to have a say.In fact, there are many - maybe too many - flight safety regions in Europe.
The data exchange between the control centers, coordination of flights on the ground, is becoming increasingly complicated.There is still a lot to rationalize and automate.In some countries, the number of control centers will be massively reduced in the near future.
EuroControl, who has already been bordered by the upper airspace over the Benelux countries and parts of Germany and France, receives a branch in Vienna that will work for Austria and its eastern neighboring countries.However, renovation into stages of a large fusion of air traffic control across Europe is not up for debate.Most countries throb on their sovereignty.
But there are also quite technical advantages of a smaller organization: If a center fails because of a breakdown, the neighboring can help much better.Very large control centers, as are common in the United States, also pose corresponding risks.
The air traffic control is not completely turned over overnight.However, there have been extensive renovation work on the air road system for some time - and still for very long.A year ago, for example, the so -called area navigation was also introduced in Switzerland in the upper airspace.
The aircraft no longer have to fly from a fixed place (designated by radio stations on the floor) to the next, but may freely choose their course.Many detours have disappeared.However, there are restrictions if the military aircraft claim their right to run.
The satellite navigation system with which more and more aircraft work offers good conditions for land navigation.For the time being, however, it should not be navigated exclusively with satellites, the system is not yet technically perfect, especially with the height information.In addition, the European countries do not want to be entirely dependent on the US military, which belongs to the most important system (GPS).
It is therefore planned to build a European system that should complement GPS and the Russian glonass.Smaller airports in particular promise advantages.You could then do without the expensive instrument landing system (ILS).
During the reorganization of the air routes, which made headlines a few weeks ago, some new direct routes have been created via Europe, which get by with as few crossing points as possible.At the same time, the air routes have been widened, which should facilitate crossing and overtaking maneuvers at the same amount.This regime will also be introduced in Germany in the coming winter.
Kaspar Senn from the planning and development department has already prepared more data, less wording Swisscontrol in Geneva in Geneva: on January 24, 2001, 38 countries expand the usable airspace in one fell swoop.
In the upper area, where the height graduation of an air route floor on the next 2000 feet (about 600 m) is so far, the distance is reduced to 1000 feet.Six new so -called flight areas can be created via Europe, the capacity will increase considerably.Further capacity increases are promised from a division of airspace into smaller control sectors.
However, this would require more staff when it comes to air traffic control - and this is not necessarily available.In order for air traffic to work in the air, huge data traffic on the ground is necessary.Expansion work is also underway.
Already at the test stage there is a new radio system in which the air traffic control instructions are no longer transmitted to the pilot by language, but in writing.Today air traffic controllers and pilots from radio traffic are very stressed, digital data transfer is faster and even safer.The flight safety organizations are better networked on the ground.
The radar images from data that supply various antennas are already composed today, including across national borders.What is still missing is a mature management system to link the radar data and the airplans.The ideal would be if the air traffic control could simulate the entire air traffic on the computer hours in advance using the flight plans.
In this way, conflicts could be identified and prevented in good time.The problem is often the software that becomes a rational manner, the bottlenecks simply arise elsewhere, on the airports, for example.Whether traffic should be distributed at more airports (unbundling of line, charter and private aviation) is more of a political question.
On the other hand, the novelty, which will soon be introduced in Frankfurt, is very technical: In order for the parallel landing slopes to be better utilized, the lighter machines will only end up in the middle of the slopes.This can be avoided the danger that threatens you from the wind turbulence if you put on right behind a large plane.
The effect: In the future, Frankfurt can be created, so in the future 80 starts and landings per hour instead of the 76th Swisscontrol so far has a good radar system, which, however, has never reached the originally planned level of development.EuroControl in Maastricht has the most modern control center in the world, which has been waiting for commissioning for two years.The problem that appears again and again is the software.
Kaspar Senn, knows how it works: "" The computer scientists say: "You just have to do that and that.»However, the complexity of this type of data processing is almost always underestimated.
"" The air traffic controllers shouldn't become so unnecessary.Image Martin Zünti -free
Flight for pilots who take care of themselves: this is the long -term goal of some aviation experts."

Armor's program 1999 with the second stage Florako / / (AP) The Federal Council approved the 1999 arms program.With CHF 1.019 billion, the average of the armaments programs has been below the average of 1987.
The available armaments loans will go back 53 percent between 1990 and 2001, as the Federal Department of Defense, Population Protection and Sport (VBS) writes.The most important individual project is to complete Florako procurement.The first stage with CHF 489 million for the new airspace monitoring and operational control system, which replaces the outdated Florida system, approved the parliament last year.
The second stage for CHF 239 million is now being brought forward because, according to VBS head Adolf Ogi, the need is shown and because the rapid implementation is advantageous.Distribution is dispensed with originally intended modernization measures in the controversial tactical aircraft.However, the exchange of information between the two systems is guaranteed, as armor chief Toni Wicki said.
In total, according to Wicki, Florako will be cheaper than planned. 195 million francs go to the procurement of canister ammunition.CHF 143 million are intended for the modernization of transmission material and the purchase of 9,000 radio devices.CHF 132 million costs CHF 105 MoWag cyclists for mechanized infantry.
115 million are required for 400 vans and 325 trucks.In both cases, there are commercially available vehicles.A simulator is to be set up in Thun for training in the battle management (CHF 68 million).
And the rescue troops should receive new lighting and electricity supply range for CHF 24 million.The domestic share of the entire program is estimated at CHF 456 million or 45 percent, and employment in Switzerland at 76 percent.With a single construction project for CHF 17.9 million, the Federal Council has been applying for the smallest military construction program for over 30 years.

US authorities for tax problems of Boeing 737 / / (AP) Tax problems for type Boeing 737 movement aircraft would have caused two fatal accidents and almost a third.
The American traffic safety authority NTSB comes to this conclusion.The modifications on the affected aircraft type already ordered by the American air traffic authority FAA were not sufficient, it was said at the end of a hearing in Springfield (Virginia). The aircraft manufacturer, on the other hand, said that the security balance of the Boeing 737 was excellent.A total of around 77 million times have started since the introduction in 1967.
In comparison, the number of accidents is negligible.The hearing dealt with the crash of a Boeing 737 of the U.S. airline in 1994. At that time, all 132 people were killed at Pittsburgh.

Against the hopeless diversity in air transport law / / by Regula Dettling-Ott*, the Montreal Protocol No. 4 came into force until twenty years after its elaboration.The next revision draft is already available and is to be discussed in Montreal in May.
The Montreal Protocol No. 4 regulates the promotion of air freight and brings decisive changes for the air freight letter and liability.For 70 years, the Warsaw Agreement has regulated the air transportation of people, luggage and freight.This agreement of 1929 standardized the transport documents, liability, judges and lawsuits.
In 1955 the original agreement was supplemented by a first protocol (Hague Protocol).Four further protocols followed in the mid-1970s, and the Montreal protocols No. 1 to 4. To the present day, three of these four protocols came into force:
The Montreal Protocols No. 1 and No. 2 in 1996, the Montreal Protocol No. 4 in June 1998. Montreal protocol No. 1 and No. 2 is the only purpose, the currency unit (Gold Franconia), in which the previous versionsDefine the liability limits of the agreement to convert to special educational rights (SZR).The Montreal protocols No. 3 and 4, on the other hand, contain significant changes in the transport documents (flight certificate and air freight letter) and liability.
The Montreal Protocol No. 3 changes the regulations for personal injury.It never came into force because the United States opposed the absolutely applicable lime limits for personal injury from the start.The Montreal Protocol No. 4, which assumes the transport of freight new regulations, came into force in June 1998.
Today 44 countries ratified it, including Switzerland;Since March 1999 it has also been in traffic with the USA. The Montreal protocol No. 4 simplifies the regulations on the air freight letter.The airline no longer has to issue a air freight letter, but with the consent of the sender, the data for transport can only be recorded electronically.
The sender is given a confirmation on request that he has given up the freight.With this confirmation, he has access to the stored data.If the airline exhibits an air freight letter, it no longer has to be abandoned together with the freight.
The drastic innovation brings the Montreal Protocol No. 4 in relation to liability.So far, under the Warsaw Agency, the airline has been responsible for the loss, damage, damage or destruction of the freight per kilo with a certain amount.This amount was defined in gold francs;
In Switzerland, this corresponds to CHF 67.50 or CHF 72.50 per kilo depending on the evaluation of gold parity.If the airline can be proven to be very severe (“Wilful Misconduct”), it must compensate for all the damage.Under the Montreal protocol No. 4, the airline is liable at 17 SZR per kilo.
This corresponds to around CHF 34 per kilo in Switzerland, i.e.H.Around half of the amount that was paid in Switzerland under the previous version of the Warsaw Agreement (but not much less than the US $ 20 per kilo that apply in many other countries today).Unlike the previous system, this limit applies absolutely, i.H.The airline can also rely on it if it caused the damage grossly negligent or on purpose.Limited
The opposite of the absolutely applicable liability limits are limited to the possibilities that the airline can assert in order to avert liability.So far, she has been able to avert liability if she has shown that she has taken all measures to avert the damage.
Under the Montreal Protocol No. 4, there are only limited perspectives, such as inappropriate packaging due to third parties or defective content of the shipment.- The principle of impossible liability may seem blunt at first glance: even with theft, the limits apply.
Behind the concept is the consideration that freight damage can be processed quickly thanks to the clear regulation.Because specialists are primarily involved in the international freight business, it is reasonable for them to make the value declaration intended in the Montreal Protocol No. 4 if the airline is to make a higher compensation.The Montreal Protocol No. 4 defines its area of application equally as the Warsaw Agreement:
In the event of simple transportation, the departure and destination must be in a contracting state;In the event of a return flight, it is necessary that the departure and destination are in a contracting state and in another state - it does not need to be a contracting state - a landing is planned.What is decisive is the route that has agreed to the sender and airline and which is apparent from the air freight letter.
The promotion of freight is almost exclusively about so -called simple flights.The Montreal Protocol No. 4 is therefore usually only applicable to freight endings if the agreed departure and destination is ever in a contracting state.After the United States has ratified the protocol, the number of contracting states will increase significantly.
Effects for Switzerland's sweat, the entry into force of the Montreal protocols has led to an objection to the amount of liability limits.The air transport regulations include that compensation is CHF 72.50 per kilo.The amount goes back to the conversion of the gold amounts of the Warsaw Agreement in the version of the Hague Protocol.
This conversion contradicts the definition of the liability limit in the Montreal protocols because they define the compensation per kilo in special education rights.In practice, this contradiction caused confusion.The Federal Council should therefore adapt the air transport regulations to the new circumstances as quickly as possible.
This applies all the more because the Aviation Act obliges the Federal Council to issue the air transport regulations in accordance with the agreements relating to Switzerland.After the Montreal Protocol No. 1 and 2 for two years and the Montreal protocol No. 4 have been in Switzerland since last summer, it justifies the revision.The principle that liability limits are defined in special education rights in air law will also not change the upcoming revision of the Warsaw Agreement.
The Montreal Protocol No. 4 only came into force 20 years after its elaboration - and may have already survived.There is already a new draft for the revision of the Warsaw Agreement.According to this design, the regulations on the transport of freight should also be changed.
In particular, the principle of absolutely applicable liability is canceled in the draft, and the airline is to be rejected again in the event of severe fault.A diplomatic conference will take place in Montreal in Montreal to discuss the draft.In the best case, this conference will adopt a new agreement or a new protocol.

Easter backlog (2).Air traffic out of control.From the dream of freedom over the clouds / / /
By Sepp Moser · Suppose, Mr. Müller wants to drive from Zurich to Olten by car.Departure at seven o'clock, meeting at the destination at half past eight.Half an hour before the departure, he receives a call from the traffic control center in Brussels:
You can drive through the Baregg tunnel between nine o'clock fifty and ten o'clock.Not before and not afterwards.The example is real when Olten is replaced by Paris, London or another air traffic destination, the Baregt tunnel through the corresponding air routes.
Europe's air traffic collapses: In 1998, traffic rose by five percent (compared to 1997), delays increased by 44 percent.For Switzerland, the numbers were even worse: traffic increase seven percent, increase in delays 73 percent.
In the Zurich region, every aircraft was late around 22 minutes in June 1998.The problem is a European: Despite significantly more intensive air traffic, both the location and the trend are far less dramatic in the same large economic area of North America.
A European problem for Europe's misery is completely archaic airspace management.49 flight control centers work as part of 31 national systems with devices from 18 different suppliers;The computers use 22 different operating systems and 30 program languages.
There are also labor law peculiarities.At the Swiss-French airport of Basel-Mulhouse, the (French) air traffic controllers suddenly noticed a few months ago that their radar was outdated and that they were now only able to master a small part of the traffic that had been processed without then.After an intervention at the political level, the radar device won its functionality.
A disruptive factor is also the military everywhere.In Switzerland, the Air Force claims about sixty percent of the airspace for its approximately 200 flight movements every day, while the 3,000 to 3,500 civil flights are in the rest.Denmark has been proving that it would be different for more than ten years.
There is no civilian and no military airspace there, but only a single sky that is there for everyone.If the Air Force needs a practice room, the civilian and military pilots ad hoc is coordinated by the civilian and military pilots working in the same room.Fighting pilots even give aside in the middle of an exercise to let colleagues pass with their Boeing 737 - uncomplicated, but unfortunately only in Denmark.
With us, relay commanders take care of all available airspace prophylactically on Friday for the following week in order to release it in a piece of the weather depending on the weather - usually so short -term that civil air traffic control can no longer be rescheduled.A study in this country provides information about the situation in this country, which was published in the summer of 1998 by the AEA, the unification of larger European airlines.The Vienna flight control center was compared as the basis with others.
Zurich therefore has to deal with 24 percent more flights, but produced 614 times as many minutes of delay.The European Air Safety Organization EuroControl came to the conclusion in January 1999: "If Switzerland does not increase its capacities, in summer 1999 the delays in the Geneva area can increase by a factor of three and double them in Zurich." Are they increased?
Switzerland recently introduced the new ARN V3 air road system with the aim of increasing performance by thirty percent by January 1, 2000 and by sixty percent by January 1, 2005.In fact, the traffic initially largely collapsed.Today Swisscontrol is proud to again achieve a hundred percent of the previous performance.
The reason is not least in the fact that there is legal transactions on the "motorways", which is suddenly separated to direction, in the Zurich region for the machines coming from the west, southwest and south and flying there.The countless crossing maneuvers impaired the flow of traffic would be easy to prevent if the access and deployment routes for Zurich airport were changed.However, this would mean the shift in some noise carpets, which cannot be enforced politically.
So the men stop at Zurich's radar screens and the delays add up.This is not to be understood as the top against the Swiss air traffic controllers.On the contrary: their performance has improved in the mass in recent years when their average age decreased.
The problems are elsewhere.First, the situation in Switzerland is actually a little special.About half of all of our country flirting starts or ends up relatively short beyond the border and therefore changes the height of us, which creates problems with oncoming traffic.
Secondly, the SwissControl Frenchmen screwed up the planning when they had the intended joint flight security center in Geneva a year ago.Every second pilot working there should be a Frenchman.Therefore, Swisscontrol reduced the training of young staff.
Today around thirty air traffic managers are missing.Due to the long training period, professionals are now being sought abroad, but their wage claims usually do not meet the SwissControl grid.Thirdly, the controversial new computer system adapted does not show any adaptability to new conditions.
So it is not possible to open new so -called sectors flexibly, i.e. defined air spaces for one team of air traffic controllers each.Only by reducing the geographical areas assigned to the individual teams can liquid traffic be guaranteed even with great traffic.After all, the problem also has roots in Brussels.
Today, all flight movements in Europe are actually coordinated centrally from Brussels.The system works in such a way that all flight control centers transmit their capacities available for the next day to the so -called CFMU (Central Flow Management Unit) of EuroControl.At the same time, the airlines register their planned flights.
A computer then determines the slots, the time windows for each individual flight.The whole thing is, like some bureaucrats, a technically perfectly organized administration of the defect without any connection to reality.Obvious nonsense nonsense is striking for every specialist:
A thinking traffic police officer brings more traffic over an intersection than a stubborn light signal system working every time.That is why the pan -European project CFMU is actually undermined.Airlines register flights several times, and the flight control instances also do what they want in their own country.
The French, British and Germans have never had their domestic flights with the biggest probability (there is nothing) of Brussels, even though they were obliged to do so.Even the highly contaminated line of London-Paris suffers as if she was a kind fate hold, hardly from delays.Only the Swiss always adhered to the rules and accepted that a line flight from Lugano to Bern sometimes had to wait for the okay from Brussels for two hours.
This should be over now .For some time now, Swisscontrol has been maintaining the politically sensitive Swissair courses between Zurich and Geneva regardless of the Brussels - there is enough space in the sky.Now the system is being expanded to all interior Swiss flights and thanks to the agreement with France, the connections between Basel and other Swiss airports are also being extended.
The Swisscontrol tip accepts that this will undermine European solidarity.The Euro Cats are obviously not very motivated to ensure smooth air traffic.In internal papers of Eurocontrol, it is openly postulated to accept an increase in delays by five percent per percent.
For this year, an increase in European air traffic is taken by at least five percent.Image: One plane after the other: Before flying, the long wait.Hansjörg Egger

The military has to practice with a reluctance / / the army has to get by with a slim armor program.It is geared towards smaller troops and is one billion far below the average of the past few years.
The Federal Council adopted the 1999 armaments program.With CHF 1.019 billion, it is 650 million below the ten -year means.It is about avoiding bad investments, said Federal Councilor Adolf Ogi.
The arms program has an average of 860 people for five years.The most expensive project with 239 million is the second procurement step for airspace monitoring and operational control system Florako.For this purpose, the parliament approved a first loan of 489 million in 1998.
The second stage originally intended for 2001 was preferred.The planned expansion of the tactical aircraft cycle (daily), which would have cost eleven to 25 million, is dispensed with from cost-benefit considerations.A third tranche of cycling tanks Piranha for mechanized infantry costs 132 million.
Instead of 205 as in the first and second tranche in 1993 and 1996, only 105 vehicles are procured with regard to the “Army XXI”.For 83 million, 6700 radio devices SE-135 and 2300 simpler small radio devices SE-138 are to be ordered as a replacement of the over 30 years of SE-125 for the lower tactical level and object protection.The number of small radio devices to be obtained was reduced by originally planned 15,000 to 9000.
The truck fleet with 325 trucks Iveco (85 million) is to be renewed instead of the Saurer 2DM and Henschel as well as with 400 civil delivery vans Mercedes Sprinter (30 million) .24 million are intended for materials from the rescue troops so that they illuminate large claims with floodlights in the event of nocturnal disastercan .The Federal Council also adopted the military construction program: the smallest in 30 years.The focus is on building an exercise village on the Bure JU weapons place for CHF 18 million.
The cost of the project was originally estimated at 32 million.32 buildings are set up for training in the struggle in the superstructed area, which give the impression of a national townscape.sda

Energy exercise of the airportanity / / mbm.Statistically speaking, flying is one of the safest types of travel.
But if an airplane has an accident, it is a major event or a disaster.Correspondingly well equipped and prepared, the medical at the airports must be in order to be able to cope with the rescue of injuries in large numbers quickly and competently.The airportanity in Kloten presented her to the media on the occasion of an exercise on Wednesday before the media and showed that it is ready for an emergency.
The task for the paramedics was to move and put up and put into operation for the paramedics that have been a soup, a discarded DC-8 on the fire brigade and medical training grounds and the mobile infrastructure to supply the injured passengers and crew.After the alarm, the five vehicles roared soon, and the head of operations assessed the situation and granted commands.First, a heating and inflatable tent was built up in which the patient's triage is carried out.
In it, paramedics assess the injuries and make a first diagnosis;Treatment then happens in one of the two mobile treatment stations that are put away a little further from the plane.In the first half hour after the accident, around 40 seriously injured should be looked after and made transportable.
On Wednesday, the airport paramedics practiced dolls, put on oxygen masks and provided them with infusions.The material container delivers electricity and water and is equipped with various rescue material such as woolen blankets.In the extreme emergency, the Zurich medical couple could still be called up.
The new material that will be used from April 1, 1999 includes a mobile emergency station with two treatment centers based on a saddle tractor.A carrier vehicle was then purchased with a so -called hook lift loader, with which the material container and a container can be transported with two other treatment points.The costs for these two vehicles, for the two containers and for the small material amount to almost two million francs.
The number of passengers that have been rising for years justified this investment for the airportanity.The new procurements replace over twenty -year vehicles and are also used for disasters in the entire canton of Zurich.In the airportanity, 39 paramedics are currently working on paramedics who use them in shift operation.

Sidestep applied for / / The government council has applied for the definitive introduction of the Sidestep approach procedure at Zurich Airport.It is the only procedure that enables compliance with the agreement between the German Ministry of Transport and the Bazl, the canton justified its decision on Wednesday.
The agreement made in 1984 is intended to distribute the approaches to the protection of Black Forest communities in a third towards the blind landing slope and two thirds towards the V-slopes.The side-step landing approach takes place up to nine kilometers before the airport, as if the pilot wanted to put on the blind landing slope.Then the aircraft first brings out to the right in a clearly defined section of the visual flight and then curves to the left onto the axis of the V-Plist, which is reached after 4.5 kilometers of a final flight.
After a one -year test phase, several communities had opposed the Sidestep at the end of 1998: Wasterkingen, Glattfelden, Höri, Hochfelden, Neerach and the German Hohentengen / Waldshut.The procedure is perceived in communities that are more stressed than before, as particularly disturbing because it is only possible in visual flight weather - i.e. if you can stay outdoors.

Small revolution in the Swissair cockpits / / The majority of the Swissair pilots will also fly short-haul (A-319 / A-320 / A-321) and long-haul aircraft (A-330).With the consequence of the implementation of the Mixed Fleet Flying concept, the Swissair takes new territory, even on a global scale.
The savings effect is estimated to be 30 million francs each year.600 to 800 flight hours are necessary for a pilot to really be familiar with a modern transport aircraft.This is the result of a study by NASA.
From this finding, it is easy to see what is the rule today in the traffic air trip: the pilots are licensed for a single type.This also means that some are always used on the long, others on the short distance.
Seen in this way, it is a small revolution that is on the Swissair: more and more A-320 pilots are also flying the new long-haul aircraft A-330.Mixed Fleet Flying (MFF) is called the concept, the implementation of which started last year.Airplane "families" now MFF is not a return to the aircraft "heroic era" of the all-rounders, whose last foothills reached deep into the era of the larger piston motor planes.
No - strictly speaking, the concept is only a implementation of what the manufacturer Airbus has long since anticipated the front of the sales front with its philosophy of the flight of witnesses. "Families".The cockpits of A-320 and A-330 are so far-identified that the layperson to recognize swords to recognize differences at all.The A-330 fly like a heavy A-321, was the judgment of those Swissair pilots who had flown the prototype in Toulouse.
This is really astonishing, you realize that the maximum departure weight of the A-330 230 tons, which of the A-320 is only 72 tons.The practically identical flight characteristics of the so different aircraft are only possible thanks to the fly-by-wire technology, which "pretends" a flight feeling to the pilot, which has nothing or almost nothing to do with the effectively in the game.Flight procedures (procedures) and systematics are very similar, at least in the "normal operation".
At the different seat heights when the aircraft is intercepted before landing - in the A -330 you sit 2.7 meters higher - you will soon be used.The introduction of the Mixed Fleet Flying is now not alone at Swissair to make the pilot profession more varied.It's about cash.
Captain Marco Müller, chief pilot A-320 / A-330, is responsible for the implementation.He has two things to prove: that the project for Swissair is financially worthwhile and that there are no cuts in flight safety.
The savings are around CHF 30 million annually.It is to be realized by a whole series of effects that MFF brings.The retraining courses are shortened (better exploitation of the skill acquired on the first type of aircraft);
The number of pilots per aircraft can be reduced.The costs for instructors should also decrease, but above all it is expected that improved planning efficiency and flexibility will bring well -known cost advantages when using the crews.Balance will be drawn in mid-2000, and then it will also be possible to decide, as with the next aircraft introduction, that of the four-beam A-340 from 2002, should be processed with regard to MFF.
Motivation boost?The effects of the new concept are different for the pilots.The Swissair heads rapidly to a pure Airbus fleet.
The basic aircraft on which every pilot career begins is the A-320.This means, for example, that the path to the long-haul cockpits also leads to passed Boeing 747 captains over this aircraft and thus over the short distance."This is something for the boys", he was also given in some cases, says chief pilot Müller.
However, he is convinced that the pilot corps mostly recognize and also learn the challenge that lies in the MFF.In addition, the development should probably not be stopped;A pilot qualified for two types will have a higher market value in the future than the one-type colleague.
The concept at Swissair for the A-320 currently provides for a ten-week retraining course.After 600 to 800 flight hours (about a year and a half), retraining can be carried out to the A-330 within ten days.It is expected that in the future the majority of the pilots will have the MFF qualification and that there will be no pilots that are only used on the A-330.
Another step in the future could be the exchange of crews as part of the qualifier Group;With Austrian Airlines (Wien-Shuttle), initial experience has been gained.Mixed crews are not considered.
MFF challenges the cockpit crews.The preparation effort is larger, even because of the larger route network.Even if the "procedures" are largely identical in air: A-320 and A-330 are half a generation of aircraft;
The systems behind it differ.What appears to be an additional burden will bring advantages at the same time, Müller is convinced.The disadvantages of long distance (time difference, climate change) and short distance (hustle and bustle) are put into perspective.
The motivation, but above all the attention (alertness, as one says in the industry) of the crews are likely to increase.In the end, according to Müller, a higher professionalism of the operation would have to result.If the Swissair now rigorously protects the cockpit equality of A-320 and A-330, it is not only interested in numerous airlines, but above all the manufacturer Airbus industry.
In Toulouse you are interested in reports from Kloten, because this is how an important sales argument from the house (finally) will find out its implementation.And all airlines are looking for savings options;On the other hand, the experiences with MFF have so far only been fragments.
Cathay Pacific implements the concept on the two types A-330 and A-340.At Lufthansa it stayed with the patterns A-320 and A-340 when trying, because MFF only pays out with relatively small fleets;In addition, this carrier has a large imbalance in the number of two patterns.

Toughness struggles around Flughafen AG / / "Image Tom Kawaralukas Briner:" "With today's democratic co -determination, the future of airport is at risk." "The privatization of Zurich Airport is heavily controversial.
The preparatory Cantonal Council Commission narrowly has the Airport Act, with 8: 7 votes, approved.In the future, Jürg Schmid in the future the canton should no longer own and lead the airport, but a stock corporation.It is planned to cut out the airport directorate (FDZ) from the cantonal administration and to merge with the airport real estate company (FIG) into a private law, mixed-economic stock corporation.
For this conversion, a law is needed that the Cantonal Council and then the people on the urn have to be good.Minority requested that the law requested and justified its applications to the media in Zurich at the end of July 1998 by the government council.The proposed independence only approved a very narrow majority of the Commission, President Lukas Briner (FDP, Uster) regretted.
A strong minority (SP, GP, LDU, EPP) wants the canton to stay owner of the airport and that you only divided the company, or that the airport becomes a public law institution.Therefore, the cantonal council is requested to reject the template to the government.The Commission advised the law at seven sessions and expanded it by seven paragraphs (see box).
Briner emphasized that clear accents were set in favor of the staff and the population.The airport partners Fig and Sairgroup, representative of the federal government as well as the president of the airport protection association and an union secretary were listened to.Briner decidedly rejected the allegation that the Commission wanted to whip the template.
Kloten as "" Hub "" preserved with today's cumbersome structure, the airport is not prepared for the increasingly harder competition in air traffic, Briner justified privatization.Kloten must be able to adapt its offer to the market needs continuously and quickly and should not be more expensive for the transit passengers than comparable competing airports such as Brussels, Munich, Vienna or Milan.It is about maintaining the airport as a hub (hub).
"" We shouldn't wait, because the competition is already a nose length ahead.An aircraft length would be fatal. "" This competition requires qualitative but also quantitative changes."" Today's democratic say, but the future of airport endangers, "said Briner.
With weighty retouching on the law, the concerns and needs of the residents were taken into account."" Noise can be very stressful, "said Briner."But it is no less unemployment.
"" "The conflict of goals - an airport as an economic engine contra calm for the population - cannot be adjusted through the Airport Act.Protecting the population and the environment is the responsibility of the federal government;A privatized airport must also be related to environmental laws
keep. "" toothless supervision "" "the reduction in commission also supports a new legal dress for the airport," but "only if the democratic say of the people and environmental protection remain," explained Hartmuth Attenhofer (SP, Zurich) the opposition of theCommission reduce against the planned privatization.
If the population could no longer have a say, the indirect, political pressure on the government also comes out.Because the airport is a very important location factor for the economic area, it must remain in the hands of the state like the universities or the rest of the public transport.Only this can ensure the social and environmental compatibility of the airport.
The minority is also bothered by the fact that parliamentary control should be switched off.With privatization, global budgeting for the airport explains, Attenhofer explained.This means that the parliament could no longer make ecological performance requirements.
The representatives of SP, GP, LDU and EPP also consider the control (blocking minority) of the canton that are intended in the law."" This is a toothless, weak instrument "," said Attenhofer."" If the Cantonal Council does not have significant improvements in the law, it will fail before the people.
"" The rejection of the template offers the opportunity to get a majority -capable airport law very soon.Independently from 2000?The cantonal council begins on May 3rd with advising the law.
The "father of the law" ", the retiring economy director Ernst Homberger, will still participate in the first reading, said Cantonal Council President Kurt Schellenberg (FDP, Wetzikon) at yesterday's press conference.The referendum is scheduled to take place in November.Voices

Addition and departure control.The majority of the commission requires the canton to comply with compliance with the access and deployment routes and the night flight regulations of the Zurich Airport.The federal supervisory authority would have to be reported.

The Commission wants to couple this right to an obligation to protect the population.It is not content with the statutory promise of the government council that the existing night flight regulations are taboo, and requires an addition: "" The purpose of the company includes the construction and operation of the airport Zurich, taking into account the statutory night flight regulations and taking into account the concerns of the populationAirport ."" The minority calls for the protection of the night flight regulations "" including the previous border hour restriction "". Participation and control.
According to the government council's request, the canton "" "more than a third of all members of the Board of Directors" should be appointed.Commission reduce also requires that the city of Zurich and the airport communities also receive a seat on the Board of Directors.With the involvement of affected communities in the operational responsibility of the board of directors, "" a minimal democratic legitimation "should be guaranteed.
Compensation.The Commission wants to make the new airport company liable for the negative consequences of the steadily increasing air traffic - a passage that is missing in the presentation of the government council.Demands from formal expropriations and passive noise protection measures, insofar as these arise before the transfer of the operating concession to the new society, would have to be taken over by this.
According to the request of a minority, the company should also be liable for inferior value for inferior and usage planning due to the noise limit values that have not yet been set.Protection for staff.In addition to the private law employment of the airport directorate staff, the company has to conclude a connection contract with the insurance fund of the canton, the majority of the Commission demands.
To do this, the existing law on the insurance fund would have to be adjusted.A minority requires the employment of the staff on the basis of a company staffing contract.Information obligation.
The majority of the commission wants to re -include the passage, according to which the government provision in the Board of Directors must inform the competent Mor -Merein Commission of the Cantonal Council on airport issues that are essential for the population.Transitional regulation.If society is founded, the company's renewed operating concession should be transferred from the federal government until 2001.

Partial privatization of the TAP Air Portugal / / ter.Lisbon, 1.
Aprildie Sairgroup takes over for 15 billion ESC.(around 120 million Fr.) A share of 20 % in the capital of a new holding company for the Portuguese airline TAP Air Portugal, which has so far been 100 % in state ownership.
According to the government in Lisbon, it has been agreed that the Swissair participates in a capital increase in the Holding TAP SGPS, which is still to be founded, into which the state contributes the entire capital of the airline TAP SA.The Commission of the European Union has the last word about this participation.The government hopes that the EU Commission will give “green light” for cooperation in two to three months.
The Sairgroup has been cooperating with the TAP since 1997, which is also part of the qualifier group.Over the next four years, the Sairgroup has the option to increase its share in the TAP SGPS via a new capital increase to 30 %.The government wants to spread a further 10 % of the capital on the stock exchange and hand over 9 % to other strategic partners.
51 % should remain in the state.From the union side, the amount that the Sairgroup has for the planned participation was criticized in Portugal.The minister responsible for traffic, João Cravinho, defended the agreement with the Swiss group as a contribution to strengthening the tap and securing jobs. (SDA)
With the participation in the TAP, the Sair Group continues its alliance strategy as part of the qualifier group.In this alliance, in addition to Swissair and TAP, the French companies are also the AOM (49 % share of the Sair) and Air Littoral (44 %), Austrian Airlines (10 %), the Belgian Sabena (49.5 %), Turkish Airlines, Crossair, Lauda Air and Tyrolean organized.Last January, Sair confirmed that she was interested in acquiring a 25%share of state -owned South African Airways (SAA).

In 2003, increasing aggressiveness in aircraft noise lawsuits / / at the airport operator Unique received around 4,000 lawsuits against aircraft noise.The call center was increased in terms of personnel, the proportion of written complaints and emails is increasing.
Complaints also enter into the Leuenberger department.In some cases, the airline.With the introduction of the southern trips, the noise forcons at Zurich Airport rose.
In November alone, around 700 complaints entered into, in December the number remained at the level of the same high level.According to the statistics of Zurich AG Airport AG, the number of lawsuits in 2001 and 2002 was 2000 annually. For 2003 there is a doubling to around 4,000.
So far, the most protests had been hailed in summer 2000 when slopes 28 was closed for the construction work for the Dock E and the departures took place south.The number of inquiries and complaints exceeded 6000, whereby around 5000 complaints focused on the two months of the slope closure.The airport's call center was set up in 2000.
Today it is occupied from 6 a.m. to midnight.The agents are trained by unique in order to be able to answer the most common questions directly.The staff of the call center can give the callers the desired information too well.
In two thirds of the cases, the question is noted and forwarded to the specialists from Unique for detailed answering.At the airport company, 6 to 8 people regularly deal with complaints from residents.Telephone calls as a lightning covenant for
The complaints came into force of the German Ordinance mainly from the east and northeast of the airport and from the Schaffhausen region.Since the introduction of the southern flights, the protests and inquiries have mainly been from the southeast, namely the upper Glattal, the Pfannenstiel region and from both banks of Lake Zurich.The responsible persons for residents state that the proportion of aggressive phone calls has increased.
It is found that callers often gave their displeasure undifferentiated, whereby the anger about aircraft noise often serves as a valve to drain steam about annoyance and fears that are hardly connected to air traffic.In any case, the principle of staying calm and listening first applies to the agents.Brought to a factual level, the symptoms are understandable in some cases.
However, it is sometimes difficult to relativize the personal view of a resident through professional information and presentation of the connections between mobility needs and labor market, politics, economy and spatial planning.Violent tones that significantly injure the rules of the good decency sometimes also stand out in newspaper editorial offices in reader debt on airport issues.The main theme of the theme of tackling the call center is often the current flight regime.
Information is also requested about individual events such as starts at unusual times or as particularly loudly perceived aircraft, starting through the start, outpatient flights or overfORE at night.Inquiries for nightly overnight stays that take place on the international air routes and have nothing to do with start and landing in Zurich are a sign of the high sensitivity that has developed with the Zurich aircraft noise discussion from the air.The focus of the inquiries also forms the operating regulations, the German regulation, the future airspace structure with the arrival and departure processes as well as technical questions about noise values and noise measurements.
A considerable number of inquiries reflects material concerns: loss of value of the property, compensation issues, costs for sound insulation measures.Council is also sought with regard to a change of apartment.
Where should you settle in the catchment area of Zurich?In the current situation, the desired information on how air traffic and aircraft noise situation will develop in the region can hardly be granted.Objectivity and extreme in the south there are also voices that describe aircraft noise as less bad than feared, threatening letters to the airport and to selected airlines occasionally occasionally concerns.
A climate of uncertainty is created with an open willingness to violence.Residents of a rich sea community, in turn, chose the way across the bank.This was opened if the Swiss grants another loan, a group of people would withdraw their accounts at this institute.
The impulse to put pressure on this way is the fact that the Swiss will fly from the south.At the Leuenberger department, the number of letters on Zurich aircraft noise issue has decreased since mid -November.At the beginning of the southern flights, the Uvek received standardized mass letters.
According to spokesman Hugo Schittenhelm, the complaints have objected to themselves.Residents described their concern and what the aircraft noise meant for their life situation.The sound is moderate.
There are only a few aggressive, regular writers.Statistics about Christmas.
Due to the German flight blocks, the weather situation would have been required for the first time on four consecutive days due to the German flight blocks from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.The southern flights were possible on December 25th, and on the 26th there was a land of north due to Nebels at the airport.In the early morning of December 27th, Skyguide saw itself due to a technical problem with the alarm system to lead 15 landings over the east after 3 flights from the south.
The failure of the alarm ads was quickly remedied, from 6 a.m. 50 the landings took place from the south again.On December 28th, the south was flown to the German blocking times.The airport's call center received 175 calls on December 27.

800 kilograms of color for an MD-11 / / ell.Only around a tenth of a millimeter thin, and yet it should offer the plane optimal long-term protection, withstand temperatures from minus 54 to plus 60 degrees Celsius, flexibly participate in the stretching and shrinking process of the fuselage, shine as long as possible, weigh little and do not strain the environment:The requirements for the aircraft paint are extremely high.
The painting process itself also requires a lot of knowledge and experience.A commercial aircraft receives a new dress every five years.The old has become unsightly from the sun, extreme temperatures, oil residues and engine gases.
In exposed areas such as bow or front edge of the tail, the air flow has often partially or completely removed the color.While the old layers used to be with -aggressive and ecologically problematic solutions, today is often only sanded before the first re -painting.However, there are still remnants of the fuselage - and therefore also weight.
This is why some airlines opt for leaking out the first time.In the case of composite materials that form a growing proportion of the structure in modern aircraft, only mechanical work can be made;Even the comparatively mild lye today would attack the plastic.
The stripes practiced by individual maintenance companies by means of high-pressure water jet has not proven itself because the aircraft skin has been used too much.Before each second painting, all metal parts of the aircraft skin are still drafted to the bottom, today with stains, which burden the environment much less than the phenol -containing means of earlier.There are also ideal conditions for structural controls that are prescribed at regular intervals.
Most of the time, the painting takes place during a major overhaul, which is also due in the common aircraft types every five years and takes three to four weeks.In addition, a further service life of the aircraft can be avoided because the work can be done in parallel.If the plane were only painted, it would have to go to the hall for seven to nine days.
Depending on the effort for the appearance, painting costs between 200,000 and 400,000 francs.With a large room jet like the Boeing MD-11, around 800 kg of color are applied, first one or two primers, then the paint layer itself.After the proportion of solutions has evaporated, there are still around 350 kg of "dry weight".
The main layer must dry for at least 48 hours by the first flight.Burning like the car is not possible for the plane due to the size.The interior of the aircraft such as cabin and freight rooms as well as the fuel tanks are also painted.
Today's colors for the outer skin are highly developed polyurethanes with a relatively small solvent and no heavy metal content.Sometimes water -soluble colors are used inside.The materials as well as the procedure are prescribed by the aircraft manufacturers and must be approved by the authorities.
The customer can make his choice within this framework.Because new fabrics are increasingly being used in aircraft construction, painting is increasingly challenged today.Environmental protection requirements also complicate the processes and require compromise on the material.
Thanks to computer aid, the painting workshops are also ready with the most elaborate logos.If a trademark is only supposed to emerge on a jet for a short time, adhesive films are used.The Swiss also learned that this has his pitfalls.
The cover material above the «...Air »the former national airline detached again after a short time at the Boeing MD-11.Experts at SR Technics attributed this to larger tolerances between rivets and their versions.
Apparently the smallest amounts of air came out of the aircraft body under pressure and squeezed under the foils.The Airbus aircraft were not affected, here the rivets are apparently sitting in their holes...

Technical defects or a gap in security?/ / A French underwater robot is looking for the Boeing 737 flightwriters at a depth of 900 meters, which had fallen into the Red Sea on Saturday shortly after the start with 148 people.
The Egyptian charter company Flash Airlines, which belonged to the accident machine, had a ban on flying and landing in Switzerland because of “considerable security deficiencies”.On Saturday morning, the FSH 604 from Sharm El-Heikh was still listed as “retardé” on the scoreboard of the Parisian Airport Roissy Charles de Gaulle.Already almost everyone knew that the Boeing 737 of the Egyptian Flash Airlines would never arrive with 135 passengers and 13 crew members.
By Rudolf Balmer, Parisdie Maschine, fell into the Red Sea two minutes after the start of the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm El-Heikh.A few times later, the Egyptian authorities announced that there were no survivors.They also dispersed the suspicion that it might be an assassination attempt.
In the Roissy hall, the numerous waiting relatives were gathered and brought to a hotel by bus, where psychologists and doctors had to teach them the tragic truth.A few could breathe a sigh of relief, they had learned that their relatives or friends hadn't booked in the accident plane and would go home with another flight.Yesterday Sunday, many people full of uncertainty in Roissy waited for the return of relatives from Sharm El-Heikh.
In France, the authorities had immediately set up telephone information, but the four numbers were constantly occupied.The list of passengers of the flight was finally published yesterday.133 of the 135 passengers were French tourists who were supposed to fly home after their Christmas holidays.
Behind the names listed are just as many fates and tragedies.Numerous children and entire families died in the catastrophe.Among the victims are a pensioner couple from the Burgundy with nine children and grandchildren as well as the mayor of a village in Normandy with his wife and three children.
At the scene of the accident, the emergency teams have so far only recovered parts of around 60 victims.French television showed aerial photographs from the crash site.In a wide area, smaller wreckage and personal belongings swam on the water surface.
No indications of an assassination Attache, which was supposedly set to a return flight towards Sharm El-Heikh, apparently exploded in the impact.Neither the previously seized aircraft parts nor the human remains, reportedly, showed any signs of fire that could indicate an explosive attack.For the Egyptian government, it was clear from the start that a technical defect was the cause of the accident.
The French Transport Minister Gilles de Robien seems to share this view.According to his information, there are currently no indications that point to a terrorist attack.The current fears before an action by the terrorist organization Al Qaida and, above all, the urgent warnings from the USA initially made the hypothesis of an assassination plausible.
After all, it was noted in France that the British Prime Minister Tony Blair was in Sharm El-Heikh at the time of the crash, where he wanted to meet President Mubarak before driving on to Iraq.However, nothing indicates a connection.The eleven -year -old aircraft, a Boeing 737 - 300 of the small Egyptian charter company Flash Airlines, had completed four flights between Sharm El -Sheikh and Italy the day before.
On the flight to Paris, it should recharge with a stopover in Cairo Kerosin.According to the Egyptian aviation authority, the start of the early Saturday was normal.The machine reached the height of 1500 meters and turned left as required.
Afterwards, the aircraft started an undisclosed curve to the right, explained the Egyptian aviation minister Ahmed Chafik.This suggests that the pilot wanted to return due to problems at the start.According to the control tower, the commander had not given any call for help or indication of difficulties by radio.
The two flight writers could provide diving robots in the clarity of operations on the exact reasons and the course of the catastrophe.The fuselage of the machine is around 900 meters deep on the seabed.The French diving robot "Achille" should provide information about the condition of the wreck and, if possible, locate the "Black Boxes", each record technical flight data and the conversation in the cockpit.
The French Marine search plane "Bréguet Atlantique" and the "Tourville" frigate as well as a group of naval divers stationed in Dschibuti also support the ongoing search and salvage work.The Parisian government of State Secretary Renaud Muselier sent the Parisian government to Sharm El-Heikh to coordinate with the Egyptian authorities.There were only debris left.
Egyptian rescuers mount the wreckage of the crashed Boeing 737 from the sea.148 people died on Saturday when the charter plane crashed.Photos Keystonein in Switzerland was Flash Airlines on the black list paris.
R.B.There is a lot to discuss in France that the Flash Airlines, which only had two aircraft, has been on a black list since the end of 2002.The Swiss Federal Office for Civil Aviation had proven this charter company with a ban on flying and landing after routine controls on board had found “significant defects”.
Bazl spokeswoman Célestine Perissinotto did not want to deliver details of the injuries to the ICAO security regulations.However, the protocol was forwarded to the European Civil Aviation offices and also to the responsible Egyptian authority.In the meantime, the Egyptian Minister Ahmed Chafik rejected all doubts about the seriousness of the charter company as “unfounded”.
An Italian passenger reported on French television who reported that a Flash Airlines aircraft had to make emergency landing in Athens in October 2002 because a engine had caught fire.Above all, one would like to know in Paris why the French authorities, who had to know from Swiss security concerns, did not in turn control the Flash Airlines more sharply.Basically, it is up to the debate whether the low -cost travel agencies do not save on air safety.
These often award the orders for charter flights about the large -scale, in this case the French Society Air Master, who in turn seeks partners with corresponding transport capacities.Often these are local societies with exotic -looking names and logos.Sometimes the customers of the travel providers who charter such flights together do not know which society they fly with.
However, the “Tour Operators” are responsible for the security of their customers.Three years ago, the chairs of the Club Méditerranée were sentenced after a crash in Senegal because their customers were transported by a charter company in Gambia instead of Air Senegal as planned as planned.«The‹ Tour Operators &#x203a have been;
A little more careful, but they still take care of the stay than the flight, ”says French flight expert François Grangier in the“ Journal du Dimanche ”.In September 2002 in Zurich.

"This is a very big day for NASA" / / The Marssonde Spirit has been on the Red Planet "on the air" with Earth and ready for exploration trips since yesterday.This is a big day for the American space agency NASA, especially since a comparable European project seems to have failed.
The Americans have succeeded straight away from the Europeans.Her Marssonde Spirit (Spirit) landed on the red planet on Sunday morning at 5.35 Swiss time and sent first radio signals.The European Lander Beagle-2 (notching dog), which arrived on Mars on Mars, is disappeared.
By Anatol Johansen, Bonnall, until the hour is not yet sure whether Spirit with its valuable payload - a 174 kilogram and 1.50 meter long, solar -electrically driven rover - all tasks set will actually be able to perform.He obviously survived the landing very well.But there are still numerous tests.
Therefore, according to the planning of the US room trip authority NASA, the Mars car will only leave its landing point for about a week.Until then, a variety of individual steps must be carried out.So far, however, a lot has succeeded.
This started with the collecting of the airbags with the help of electric motors.Then the country had to develop like a flower with three petals and release the rover.This also worked excellently because the lander put up vertically.
Only then could the Rover stretch its solar cells to recharge their solar energy.After that it was the turn of the first recordings with the deeply seated so-called "obstacle recognition camera".This camera will later be used primarily to determine an obstacle-free route for the Mars vehicle.
Even before the Mars Night was started, the extension of a special small camera mast was also on the program.A camera sits at its top that has already delivered first overview recordings.Only about four hours were available for all of these and a few other tasks.
Because then the Mars night started.The careful review of the Rover and its scientific payload as well as initial investigations at the landing site itself will take around a week.Only then will the vehicle start to move.
A maximum of 20 meters per day are provided as a route.The focus is on the search for water and possible traces of previous or today's life with the help of spectrometers and a robot arm of the rock layers and can then examine it immediately, including with the help of a microscope.Overall, the rover should be able to work on Mars for about 90 days, although sandstorms could shorten this time.
Spirit has now landed at the end of the Mars summer.As autumn progresses, less and less solar energy will be available.Because of the cooler days and nights, more energy is required to keep the batteries warm and the complex electronics.
Likewise, Mars dust, which has been deposited on the solar cells over time, could also affect their performance.For a long time, NASA has not been as jubilated as after landing the spirit."I was often quoted with the sentence that we were only six minutes away from hell during landing," said science director Ed Weiler, "and we were actually only six minutes away.
But in this case we spoke the right prayers and got up to the sky. »NASA boss Sean O’ Keefe was just as enthusiastic."This is a very big day for NASA," he let himself be heard, "now we're back.I am very, very proud of our team.
We are on Mars.That is an incredible achievement. ”And John Callas cheered from the science team:“ The quality of these pictures is the best that has ever been achieved on Mars. ”The Rover on Mars.

"Latinization" as a differentiation strategy / / "We did the necessary to be one of the survivors," says Gordon Bethune, CEO of the American Continental.The worldwide airline wants to strip the purely American image.
Far-tensioned alliances and codeshare agreements are the funds in the struggle for customer favor.Shortly before Continental Airlines ended up with the bankruptcy office for the third time within a decade, Gordon Bethune had sat down on the joystick and brought the shrunk carrier to profitable course.The charismatic CEO, once a pilot and aircraft mechanic, converted Continental thanks to the unmistakable command "From Worst to First" (according to the title of his autobiography) and made "his" airline the world's largest and one of the most profitable so far.
Now the equally admired and feared Gordon can need what he learned in the survival camp-because the escalating struggle between low-cost airlines and traditional airlines embedded in worldwide alliances and the only hesitating overall demand also affect the amazingly resistant highflyer.In the November treasury, the November trucks only resulted in a net profit of around $ 37 million ($ 23 million after taxes) thanks to the sale of the Hotwire Internet travel portal, and the coming months will also be classified as difficult."Our goal for 2004 is not to lose money," is the requirement for the new year.
Despite the freezing environment, the overall relief developed in November (this the final available figures), which is shown at 75.3 percent and was thus 5.5 points above the comparison month in 2002.Above average (+7.2 percent) to 76.3 percent, traffic on the international route network recovered, while the internal American flights increased by 4.5 percent and reached 74.7 percent.Continental flew a total of 4.7 billion passenger miles (RPM) with 6.3 billion available seat miles (ASM) and - with a slight expansion of the available capacities by 0.7 percent and a respectable plus of 8.7 percent in traffic -Seat mile generated yield between 4.5 and 5.5 percent.
As usual, cultural sensitization gordon Bethune was combative and tidy on the occasion of an internationally folded media orientation in Houston, the headquarters of Continental Airlines."We did the necessary so that we are among the survivors," he outlined the current situation in the airline business.
In addition to the strict cost reduction program (a further $ 400 million savings in 2004, according to $ 500 million since September 11, 2001), soft factors are particularly targeted.For example, Continental wants to get away from the purely American image as a global active airline and takes the so-called “Latinization” of some services in the sense of a refined differentiation strategy.It is about aligning the on -board catering to the flownest destination;
Furthermore, flight attackers and airport employees are sensitized to cultural issues of the destination or place of work, and in the job profile the linguistic dexterity is used as an important decision criterion.Latinization takes place nearly, especially in the Latin American and Caribbean region, which generates a third of the international traffic volume, while around 20 percent are nearly on the transatlantic routes and on the pacifish and Asian destinations.Houston, Newark, Cleveland, Guamkeine
The lifting strategy experiences change with the hubs with the Houston, New York, Cleveland and Guam hubs, whereby in the sense of global risk distribution, international traffic is increasingly being forced - in the hope of being able to react quickly to above -average demand developments in booming markets and to be able to withdraw corresponding capacities from ailing regions.In the meantime, 96 international destinations (in addition to the 127 inner -American) belong to the route network, 8 of the 11 new ones - according to Geneva - are outside the USA. In Mexico, a traffic focus in Central America, numerous additional cities with new jets are 37and 50 seats flown;Continental now serves 23 Mexican goals from the Texas Houston.
This turnstile is well positioned for using smaller machines with sufficient capacity for less frequented routes.After passing the litmus test, the concept mentioned in mid-December was extended to the New York Hub (Newark Liberty International), from where a 50-placed jet after Freeport has been flying onto the Bahamas since then.- The access to new destinations, routes and flight times enabled by numerous alliances and codeshare agreements with airlines in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia is used as an important instrument in the fight for customer favor, with the particular that with Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlinescollected cooperation should be expanded.
The Codeshaare Agreement with KLM was extended in the third quarter and opens up Continental passengers access to 69 KLM destinations in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.For his birthday A new terminal continental Airlines can celebrate her 70th anniversary this year (as the successor to the regional flight line Varney Speed Lines founded in 1934) and gave itself a gift.Together with Houston Airport was at George Bush
Intercontinental Airport of the international international terminal E planned, co -financed and inaugurated.The over 50,000 square meter building complex comprises 23 gates and is characterized by huge glass fronts and the integration of architectural elements, which is already known from the recently completed Nevark terminal expansion.The numerous flight information on large monitors, the respective noise level, which is adapted to the respective noise level, and the last generation of machines for self-check-in are also worth mentioning.
Terminal E forms the heart of the international, mainly geared towards the Latin American and Caribbean destinations, Houston's Continental route network and reaches full operational readiness on January 6th.Werner Knechtbahl The flight accident victim at the lowest level since 1945 (SDA) last year, 1204 people were killed in 162 gaps in aircraft.
The number of flight accident deaths has been at the lowest level since 1945. At 63 percent, the American continent is the top priority.In the United States, there were 60 accidents or 37 percent of all flight accidents last year, as the Archive Office for Aircraft Hunglücke said in Geneva.
13 percent of accidents occurred in Africa, 10 percent each in Europe and Asia and 2 percent in Oceania.Of the total of 162 accidents, 36 on line and 18 on charter flights.This category thus includes a third of all accidents from 2003.
In 51 cases, private and freight aircraft were involved in 22 cases.15 accidents were happening during auxiliary or observation flights.14 machines crashed during training flights.
6 crashed aircraft were military machines.With Zurich and Geneva "satisfied" W. K. Despite the forced expansion of the Houston hub, no further Continental direct flights to Europe are planned, because the largest demand potential is already well-served with Newark.
CEO Gordon Bethune is “very happy and satisfied” about the utilization of the six weekly flights (winter flight schedule) from Zurich (winter flight schedule) not announced).According to other sources, however, an even greater demand was expected from the Geneva area.At the headquarters of the Zurich branch, this is attributed to the strong Geneva presence of European carriers, which have jumped into the breach quickly and successfully after the Swissair flights were lost.

How dangerous is Swiss airspace?/ / Not only the misfortune of Überlingen, but also regularly published reports on almost combined togetherness (Near Misses) via Swiss territory recall the risk of collision in aviation.
Comparisons with abroad remain difficult for the time being, because reporting and examination criteria are too inconsistent.Last December, the office for flight accident examinations (BFU) not only published the investigation report on the Crossair-Hunglück of Nassenwil (NZZ 2. 12. 03), but also a number of reports on so-called almost combined people in Swiss airspace.Such approaches from aircraft have occurred regularly in recent years, on average once a month.
Can we therefore talk about luck that the aircraft collision over Überlingen was an isolated case, as it happened in Europe decades ago?And is the risk of collision particularly high in the Swiss flight security company Skyguide?With some probability, the answer is no.
Significant comparisons with abroad are of course difficult because in almost every European state there are different criteria for what is classified as a "serious incident" (incident with a considerable risk of a collision).After all, there is a certain improvement in sight.For a year, the umbrella organization of European flight protection, EuroControl, has been using uniform criteria to record the dangerous approaches in the airspace.
Until recently, however, there was a real confusion.In Germany, for example, flight control officers decide on the cases in which an examination is initiated.In other countries, “alarm” is automatically raised if a radar measurement relief value is only slightly undercut.
The rule of Switzerland is the rule that the BFU then takes an examination if there was a serious collision risk when two aircraft approached.Last year the case was 19 times the case, in 2002, 2001 and 1999 each 13 times.In 2000 the value reached 20.
However, the time series is too short to recognize reliable trends.The number of incidents reported by the air traffic control, by pilots, airlines, airlines and air force without acute collision risk.Last year, around 100 such events resulted.
They are summarized by the ATIR committee (Air Traffic Incident Report) with the contributions of the stakeholders.Swiss airspace is considered a comparatively complex.With around one million movements according to instrument flight rules, it has a high traffic density per year and is characterized by many vertical movements due to the narrow neighborhood of several airports, which greatly increase the coordination effort of the airline.
Around 90 percent of the AirProximity-(«AirProx»-) Cases examined by the BFU result in security recommendations to the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZL).You regularly have the radio discipline and the correct application of the internationally regulated phraseology by pilots and air traffic controllers.In addition, in this context, a technically determined shortcoming of radio speaking traffic has an unfavorable effect.
As every military radio knows, only one participant can speak on the net.This one-sided connection can lead to an instruction cannot get rid of an instruction because the radio frequency of a radar sector is "occupied" over a long time;A talk is not possible.
Here the technology is simply not on the otherwise high standard of aviation.And an improvement is not in sight at short notice.Misunderstandings as a source of danger of discipline and misunderstandings in radio traffic must not be underestimated.
The most difficult misfortune in aviation history so far, the collision of two jumbos at Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife in March 1977, had the cause in the misinterpretation of a pilot instruction.And one of the last serious accidents in Europe, the collision of a SAS jet with a business travel frame in Milan Linate, was also based on a misunderstanding.The two cases also illustrate that the problem of collision risk at the airports is particularly acute.
Nowhere is “air traffic” as dense as on the ground.An airport like Zurich with its intersection of incoming and draining traffic on the starting slope 28 therefore demands special attention from those involved.For Jean Overney, head of the BFU, it is clear that the intensification of training and training of the crews and air traffic controllers, especially when it comes to radio traffic, is the greatest potential for accident prevention.
The fact that this is the case suggests the favorable tendency of recent years in the dangerous approaches with the participation of military aircraft.A good decade ago, spectacular incidents had caused a stir.One of the FASTUNG TIGER Tiger with an Airbus of the Swissair above the Jura, led to the premature resignation of the then commander of the aviation troops, Corps Commandant Werner Jung.
Today, says OVERNEY, the intensified sensitization of the air force pilots contributes to the collision risk to the cheaper trend.In addition, there is of course the integration of military air traffic control, in which Switzerland takes a pioneering role, and the severe decline in the number of military flight movements.In order for dangerous approaches in the airspace to be reported and examined, they must first be recognized.
Until the nineties, the air traffic controller was usually the only one who recognized a conflict on the radar screen.In addition, he was not always motivated to report notification.This has changed with the introduction of the collision warning devices (TCAS) in the cockpits.
Occupings recognize airprox cases themselves.The collision about overlearing new technology, which will be introduced nationwide by 2005, is a blessing from the aspect of flight safety.Already today, before the publication of the investigation report, it is known that the TCAs on board the Tupolew 154 of the Bashkirian Airlines and the Boeing 757 freighter would have prevented the collision, the evasive maneuver they dictated would not be for reasons that stillCalling legal appreciation, prevented.
But TCAS technology has its statistical downside.The chance that critical approaches will remain undetected in airspace has therefore increased significantly, the number of reports reported."In relation to a million flight movements, 20 cases actually appear a little," says Overney."
But they play in the three -dimensional space."And on the objection that there is no more events in Switzerland than abroad (which can be assumed to prove the opposite of the opposite by the now unified EuroControl statistics), the BFU boss maintains:" But we had a disaster."Security

More jobs or more quality of life / / the Belgian government's plans to better distribute the night flights in Brussels to the city and the surrounding area have been rejected by the State Council.Minister of Transport Anciaux also has to face a new challenge: The airline DHL, which specializes in courier services, wants to double the night flights. Vau.
Amsterdam, at the end of December, Brussels in Zaventem Airport, which is located on the territory of the Flanders territory, is an airport close to the city.Only a good ten kilometers separate the airport with its three runways from the city center.The airport, from which primarily European and African destinations are served, is of great importance in particular as a European sorting center.
Brussels is the most important hub in Europe for the airline DHL specializing in courier services.Controversial investment plans have long since developed an investment plan with the aim of expanding the activities in Zaventem.Definite decisions have not yet been made.
This should not be the case until the first half of 2004.However, it is already clear that DHL wants to create numerous new jobs through the planned investments.In the short term, around 1000 new jobs are spoken, which may increase the number of DHL employees to 3500.
A good 7,000 jobs are connected to DHL directly and indirectly in Belgium.In the longer term, the creation of 4000 additional workplaces will be sought.However, the plan also provides that the number of night flights over Brussels would double.
Not 30, but 60 machines from DHL would get to heaven every night in the future.While passenger traffic is only responsible for 6 % of all night flights, no less than 67 % go to DHL account.- So far, the reactions to DHL's plans have been extremely reserved, if not negative.
Minister of Transport Bert Anciaux, for example, speaks of madness and therefore wants to campaign for a ban on night flight.A measure, by the way, which was considered years ago by the currently incumbent Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt.The central question is whether the project can be realized within the past few months with a lot of difficulty to quantize the night flights, which would allow a maximum of 25,000 nightly flights at the basis of the year.
Since DHL has repeatedly threatened to move out of Belgium in view of the explosive of the problem - among other things, Cologne, Leipzig or Bergamo - the government is looking for alternative opportunities in its own country.Head of government Verhofstadt, with his proposal to set up a second national airport in Wallonia, had violent resistance to the flaming of the flemn.In view of this polemic, the best chances of the Bierset Airport near Liège are granted the best chances because it already serves as a cargo airport and is close to the language border.
The Verhofstadt government recently approved a plan of Minister of Transport Anciaux to better spread the night flights over Brussels.Just a few days later, the plan was declared void by the State Council on pressure from residents from the east of the capital.Among other things, it was brought into the field that the more intensive use of slopes 02/20 is a security risk.
The resistance of the residents in the east is not only due to the fact that in this area of Brussels there are relatively many expensive houses of well-paid employees of the EU institutions.The affected airlines themselves also lead the security question as a result of the planned change when using the various slopes.In particular, the risk of back and side winds with which rising aircraft could be confronted is underlined.
In contrast, the government argues that both the BIAC airport authority and the air traffic management Belgocontrol were involved in the development of the new plan to spread the flights.In neighboring Amsterdam, the polemics around the noise pollution by the commissioning of the fifth start and runway was defused this year.However, since the Polderbaan is relatively far from the terminals, their use is connected to an extremely long journey (taxi) of over 20 minutes.

The warning signals from Switzerland were not observed / / in the Red Sea continues the search for the 148 victims of the aircraft disaster from Sharm El-Heikh at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula.In France, the security issues on cheap charter flights are now being discussed.
The information from Switzerland was obviously not really taken seriously in Paris.The search for the remains of the Boeing 737 of the Egyptian Flash Airlines, which fell into the Red Sea with 135 passengers on Saturday with 135 passengers and 13 crew members, will be somewhat less difficult than initially feared.The hull of the aircraft is at a depth of less than 400 meters.
This increases the opportunities of the "Achille" underwater robot to locate the Blackbox with important data, all the more than last night acoustic signals from the flight writer could be received.However, it is practically clear that a technical breakdown has led to the crash.By Rudolf Balmer, Parisein Anonymous caller on behalf of the unknown group “Ansar-Al-Haq” yesterday the Agence France Presse in Cairo said that it was an assassination as a punishment for the headscarf ban planned in France.
In Paris, however, this “confession call” is not considered credible.The Paris government has promised the members of the 133 French victims that everything would be done to recover and identify the remains.Morning
On Wednesday, a minister is to accompany the funeral families to Sharm El-Sheikh.The government is trying to clear all doubts about the control of flight safety that had arisen after the crash in Egypt.The Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (Bazl) has embarrassed the French authorities.
First you didn't want to know anything about the warning from Switzerland at the Direction Générale de l ’Aviation Civile (DGAC) in Paris.Bazl spokeswoman Célestine Perissinotto explicitly remained yesterday that the results of the surprising inspection of an aircraft from the charter company Flash Airlines had been forwarded to the responsible European partner organizations.Because of the “considerable defects” found in Kloten in October 2002, the Egyptian society was deprived of the landing and flight permit in Switzerland.
Neither France nor Italy, where travel agencies also had contracts with Flash Airlines, took similar measures.Do you have to conclude from this that the responsible authorities have drawn the Swiss complaints due to violations of the international security regulations as too petty or that the information exchange relevant to the safety of the air passengers is not taken into account by anyone?Answer all questions after the initial initial hesitation bordering on the embarrassing.
Due to the information from Switzerland, France also "subjected the Flash Airlines plane to" three -unprepared controls ".In the event of the inspections in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse at the end of 2003, except for a pneumbrading in one case, “nothing noteworthy” was stated, he said yesterday morning.He also has knowledge of a control in Poland, which supposedly gave no reason to objection.
The minister relativized the multiple criticism of worn-out facilities of the passenger space: "The more or less bad condition of the seats is not a reason for a flight ban." Too little fuel, such as Gilles Dariau, ex-pilot and director of the regional airfield of Angers, see in itRather a symptom for poor maintenance.He has bad memories from a flight with Flash Airlines: “To be honest, this society didn't seem to be very serious.
The interior (the Boeing), the seats and the belts were very worn."And on the flight to Paris, the pilot had to make an intermediate landing in Milan because he didn't have enough fuel".Italian tourists reported on a engine fire with emergency landing in Athens.
In Cairo, these allegations are all round.A spokeswoman for Flash Airlines said about the flight ban in Switzerland that it was only “a financial history” at the time.This was expressly denied by the Bazl (see article below).
13 months ago, the accident machine in Norway was revision at the Braathens company, which had no concerns about the flight.After two emergency landings in Athens and Geneva, one of the two engines in France was replaced six months ago.Georges Colson, the President of the Fram travel agency, who had organized the flight with the Flash Airlines together with two other Tour Operators, said yesterday on the radio that he "knew absolutely nothing" from the Swiss flight ban.
Otherwise he would have taken the consequences immediately.After 53 years of company history, we would never have taken such a risk ». Sprapling with the security of the security in France, after the accident of Sharm El-Heikh, it is debated whether the tourism industry with its deep price offers does not decrease in flight safety.International accident statistics could reinforce this suspicion.
In 2003, 36 disasters worldwide on line flights and 18 with charter flights.Calculated on the kilometers covered, this gives around 15 times more accidents for charter flights than on line flights.Jacques Maillot, the founder and former president of travel agencies Nouvelles Frontières, warns of hasty conclusions, who have its own charter company with Corsair:
«The rules and security regulations are the same for all companies.The supervision of the charter is even more strict.At Corsair under my leadership, there were often unannounced inspections than with Air France.»
However, the orders are increasingly being forwarded to cheaper third, sometimes hardly known local small companies, whose experience and seriousness are not beyond all suspicion.In memory of the victims.A bouquet of flowers at the crash site of the Boeing 737 in the Red Sea.
Led security deficiencies to the crash?Photos Keystonelandebot in Basel - but not in Mulhouse in Switzerland, the Egyptian Flash Airlines had no landing permit - at the EuroAirport Basel -Mulhouse, however, it should have started and landed.Because the EuroAirport is a binational airport, both the Swiss flight rights and the French apply there.
From Tilman Renz, Berndes therefore, it is sufficient for landing at EuroAirport if France permits it, regardless of whether Switzerland prohibits this airline.In this case, the aircraft would simply fly to the “Mulhouse” destination, not the destination “Basel”.For the fact that Switzerland was allowed to build with the EuroAirport beyond the national border, one had to comply with certain rules of the game, says Urs Haldimann, head of the “Competence Center International” at the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZL).
On the other hand, the regulations are more clear outside of the flight rights, for example in airport security: there, the territorial principle applies, so responsibility lies with the state, in the area of which the airport is located.Anti -terrorist measures, for example, were carried out by French units at EuroAirport.
Despite an assassination between the Flash Airlines, the FLASH Airlines is still in focus.According to the EuroAirport spokeswoman Viviane Gaskell, an aircraft of this airline once stood in Basel-Mulhouse-in 1994, eight years before the Bazl of the Egyptian airline withdrawn the landing permit.Security deficiencies were responsible for this decision in October 2002, as the Bazl emphasized yesterday after Egyptian sources had claimed financial problems for the landing ban.
According to the BAZL, the Federal Office found the same defects in October 2002 in October 2002.According to international standards, the signage of the emergency exits was partly in unusable condition.In addition, in the area of the chassis, the engines and the flight control, "obvious maintenance defects found". Information on authorized ...
The Bazl informed yesterday about the situation at the time, although information about state controls of aircraft are confidential in accordance with the Federal Office.The image damage for a friend airline should be a reason for this - accordingly, the Bazl pointed out that the information about the state of the aircraft in October 2002 "has no conclusions about the security level of society and the state of the machine before the start of the accident flight»should be drawn from last Saturday.In contrast, the results of the randomly "apron controls" of foreign aircraft are passed on to the database of the "Joint Aviation Authorities" based in the Netherlands, which are connected to the aviation authorities of many European countries.
The International Aviation Association (IATA) supported the Swiss representation.In fact, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation has deposited its security concerns in international data exchange, called Safa, said IATA spokesman William Gaillard in SF DRS's “Tagesschau”.The French authorities then also made samples from Flash Airlines machines.
Apparently, these were satisfactory, which is why the planes were still allowed to land in France ... but not in passing with confidentiality of the information, but also: Potential passengers do not know whether Switzerland also prohibits other companies in addition to Flash Airlines.One point that consumer organizations have been complaining for a long time.
Walter Kunz, the managing director of the Swiss travel agency association, considers the risk that passengers from Switzerland are on the road with charter planes that are not allowed to end up in Switzerland (for example in “Mulhouse”)Switzerland will be covered by the big tour operator Kuoni (with the Airtschaft Edelweiss-Air) and Hotelplan (with Belair) and the Swiss.In addition, the pricing regulation prescribes the clear definition of the "performance":
Things willing to travel then have to know at the conclusion of the travel contract which airline you will bring to your desired destination.Here, too, the binational EuroAirport forms a special case: organizes a Swiss company the journey, the Swiss flight regulations (and land permits) apply at Basel Airport.
The French flight rights are used at a French travel agency at Mulhouse Airport.This is intended to prevent circumvention business between the Basel region and Alsace.However, if a Basel bidder turns to a travel agency in ST-Louis, then no one does not care which airlines the BAZL refuses the flight from and to the EuroAirport.
Cloudy holiday joy.Instead of being able to fill up in Egypt in Egypt, the tourists are reminded of the tragedy by the presence of the search ships.Commentary concessions on the cost printer charter societies do not sacrifice the safety of their passengers on the altar of the low-cost trend.
It would also be unfair to discrepse up an entire industry that made many tourists possible in distant world regions.Nevertheless, the example of Flash Airlines raises serious questions.Above all, there is the obvious problem of the international information exchange of the civil aviation authorities, which would have to form the necessary counterpart to globalize air traffic.
In the course of the deregulation and under the price pressure of the travel agencies, and disappear practically every day small airlines that sometimes have one or two machines, such as the Flash Airlines, which they have to use at the maximum or possibly up to the limit of total wear, in order to competitivelyto be .It is saved first at the service or on external things such as seating comfort.And what about the training of pilots and soil staff?
Where is the limit for the concessions of cost pressure?Significantly, there is also a similar discussion about control and maintenance by cheap companies for tanker ships.The market opening of international supervision is far ahead of the country, on the seas and in the air.
That won't change so quickly.After the shock of the tragedy by Sharm El-Heikh, it is to be hoped that in the interest of security, at least control is tightened and international cooperation will be taken a little more seriously.Rudolf Balmer

More flight accident victims in Switzerland / / Bern, Jan. 5 (AP) In contrast to global development (NZZ 5. 1. 04), the number of fatalities at flight accidents in Switzerland has increased significantly in 2003.
According to the provisional information from the Flight Accident Investigation Office (BFU), 33 people died in the event of accidents in Switzerland or with aircraft enrolled in Switzerland.In 2002 the number of flight accident victims had been 16 and had dropped to the lowest level in nine years.In the years 2000 and 2001, 51 and 50 people died in flight accidents, so much more than last year.
The number of injuries amounted to 21 in 2003 and thus corresponded to the level of the previous year.It is striking to massage fatal flight accidents during the hot period of summer.There were 10 aircraft and 21 people died between May 28 and July 13th.

Both flash jets were closed / / The Swiss aviation inspectors are not fussy during the examination of foreign aircraft - as long as airlines and pilots are not careless.By Erwin Haaszürich.
- Not only one, but both Boeing 737 of the Egyptian Flash Airlines were controlled in Switzerland in 2002 - the first in April, the second in October 2002. The federal experts both assessed them as accompanied by the Swiss sky."The pattern of the Flash managers was clearly," says Inspector Michael Grüninger from the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL), which is responsible for testing the aircraft at Swiss airports.
He has already kept Swiss, British Airways and Air France aircraft on the ground.Usually the airlines and the supervisory bodies of the countries of origin are happy to be pointed out to defects and would remedy them immediately.Heavy technical deficiencies in the case of the Flash Airlines and the Egyptian air.
The Bazl confirmed yesterday that technical defects were the reason for the bans and contradicted the statement of Flash representatives who spoke of a financially established flight ban.According to Bazl, navigation documents were missing on board, the pilots had not calculated the fuel reserves according to international standards, the emergency outputs were insufficiently signposted.Fearing gear, engines, flight control showed “obvious maintenance defects”.
The Bazl asked Flash Airlines after the first exam to remedy the defects before the next entry.When the same defects came to light in the exam of the second Flash aircraft in October, the Bazl had a ban on landing until the Egyptian authorities guarantee airiness.As a result, there was no guarantee that "the defects were remedied", the Bazl refused further land permits.
The Bazl inspectors carried out a good 200 samples in 2003 (TA from Monday).Two to three a year are so negative that the aircraft is no longer allowed in the air until the defects are remedied.The BAZL corrected previous information on Monday: not 10 but 23 aircraft are on the ban on the ban.
The names of the affected airlines should not be published for data protection reasons."We cannot connect to the whole fleet due to a criticized aircraft," said Bazl spokesman Daniel Göring.But the airports would be informed.
As soon as the aircraft door is open, the aircraft is no longer considered an autonomous territory of the country of origin.The inspectors have the right to check on board whether crew and aircraft correspond to the regulations of the international civil aviation.The checklist contains 54 points.
Pilot licenses, insurance, maintenance, technical and operational on -board books, company manuals, navigation cards, safety equipment in cockpit and cabins are listed.According to Inspector Grüninger, the most frequent serious defect in the cockpit area includes missing or outdated databases in the navigation computers and insufficient collision warning devices.Sometimes pilots injured the most elementary rules of flight preparation - for example, if they lightly forego weight and fuel calculation and had the thumb tired.
The Swiss flight ban for the Flash aircraft was noted in the central database, which is open to all European aviation inspectors.In both Germany and in France, experts made different conclusions than the airline (in Germany for 2003) applied for landing rights: they inspected the two flash jets several times and assessed them as flying.
Uniform standards in September, the European Commission has founded an agency that should ensure uniform standards of aviation safety in all countries in Europe.Switzerland wants to agree with bilateral transport contracts.A country's flight ban then applies to the entire continent.

Switzerland remains hard: Flash Airlines was too little safe / / after accusations on the part of the Egyptian charter company, the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation went on the offensive yesterday:
It justified the landing ban with "serious" defects.· Gregor Poletties does not correspond to international customs to make security deficiencies of reviewed airlines public.But the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) was forced to do so.
After the crash of a Boeing 737 of the Egyptian charter company Flash Airlines, the head of the airline claimed that the cause of the landing ban in Switzerland was only a financial matter.A horror listed contradicts the Bazl vehemently and yesterday described in detail with a press release why there was a ban on land.The deficiencies, which are obtained on two different aircraft of the Flash Airlines, reads for air passengers like an incredible horror scenario:
“Among other things, there were no documents for navigation on board, the calculations of the fuel reserves were not based on international standards, and the signage of the emergency exits was partly in unusable condition.In addition, maintenance defects were found in the area of the chassis, the engines and flight control.“It cannot be astonished that Switzerland went through hard and that it was banned from landing in October 2002.
Especially since the remedy of the defects requested after a first inspection in April 2002 was not followed: an aircraft with similar defects only fell through a new check for five months later.Several instances have been informed about these steps:
The Egyptian aviation authorities and the head of the European inspection program.In addition, the BAZL made accessible to the other European countries involved in the program via a specially designed database.Experts Stred Sichderweil broke out a veritable expert dispute two days after the charter machine crashed over the Red Sea with 148 fatalities.
In particular, security deficiencies at Flash Airlines are contested from a French side.The French Transport Minister Gilles de Robien attested a “good reputation” of the charter company.He said on French radio that there were “no complaints” on two controls after the landing ban in Switzerland.
However, this contrasts with information that passengers make about Flash Airlines.According to Egypt, French frequent flyers reported on a “pathetic” state of the charter machines on the Paris Scharm El sheikh.
During a flight on December 27, she saw cracks in a door of the machine, a woman from the daily newspaper said "Le Parisien".Further doubts about the security measures of the Flash Airlines have fed the known of two emergency landings in Athens and Geneva.However, no assassination attorney currently seems that the tragic crash of the Boeing 737 was not an assassination attempt.
The French government has at least no indication of an attack.The recovered victims also had no signs of fire, said the State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry, Renaud Muselier."There is clearly no reason to assume that this was an assassination attempt," said Muselier.
A technical breakdown is currently suspected as the cause of the crash of the machine with predominantly French holidaymakers.It is assumed that one of the two engines failed and the machine then fell into the Red Sea "like a stone".· Picture Keystoneein
Egyptian boat guide shows a wreck part that he pulled out of the Red Sea.Aircraft Controls Act lies on the accident. The EU Commission reminded that it submitted a European law for improved security controls on aircraft in 1997.Because of the law, there is a dispute between the EU Minister Council and the EU Parliament, said the spokesman for traffic commissioner Loyola de Palacio.
According to Switzerland, France would have been committed to checks according to the planned EU directive, the spokesman said.Doubts of Greek authorities in the security of the airline should have been passed on."With the new guideline, these doubts would have become known before the accident and not afterwards," said the spokesman.
Among other things, DPADA's EU Act provides for a database with the results of all aircraft controls in Europe.National authorities are also intended to maintain the right to capture the ground as dangerously classified machines.DPSuche in the red Meertote in the Wrack VermuteTam crash location in front of the charm

Name the sinners airlines!/ / 23 poor jets must not fly to Switzerland.According to the Foundation for Consumer Protection (SKS), passengers are in the dark via the affected aircraft and airlines
Leaved. "The gentlemen’ s agree, an unscrupulous and inhuman agreement, prevents the names of the airlines that use poor aircraft, "writes SKS managing director Jacqueline Bachmann in a media release.According to Bazl interim director Max Friedli, this gentlemen ’s Agreement is to be avoided a possible economic damage to the airlines.
Bachmann emphasizes that this international gentleman aggreement deliberately jeopardizes human life.With its letter, the SKS reacts to the crash of a flash airline machine off the Egyptian coast.In it, the SKS managing director criticizes: "Such an agreement is outrageous - this unscrupulous aggreement only protects the airlines, the potential crash victims remain completely defenseless." SKS:
Minister of Transport Leuenberger therefore calls on to intervene in a letter;Flight passengers should be able to get an idea of the security of the airlines before departure.
Therefore, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) is to publish a list of airlines that have blocked machines.BAZL: Not possible the agreement not to publish the names is applied by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) and cannot be lifted unilaterally by Switzerland, said Bazl spokeswoman Célestine Perissinotto on request.In addition, the names of the airlines are under data protection.
The International Aviation Association (IATA) believes that the public has a right to find out which airlines are affected - but this is only due to serious defects, said IATA director William Gaillard.In cases like Flash Airlines, the public has the right to be informed.Travel agencies: no listing
Only the Bazl should act, but also travel agencies, SKS managing director Jacqueline Bachmann continues."These should no longer offer customers flights with such airlines." The travel agencies are also not aware of the 23 poor aircraft, said the managing director of the Swiss travel agency association, Walter Kunz.In general, however, an assessment of the safety of aircraft is difficult.
"The criteria would have to be shown." Customer: Do not choose the travel agency, but the tour operator decide which airline will be recorded in the package offer, said Kunz.On individual trips, the travel agency shows the various flight options;The customer could then choose.
List: Would be a call murder, which is why the Bazl did not publish such a list, says Kunz.«That would be a call murder.“But he would also welcome a list.
Nevertheless - for Kunz, the plane is the safest means of transport."But nobody is immune from a crash," he says.JSP /
Sdukuche after the flash-airline jetta diver locations and wreck divers located the wreck on Tuesday off the coast of the Egyptian seaside resort Sharm El-Sheikh and the flight writer of the crashed machine from Flash Airlines.However, the flight writer has not yet been recovered from the seabed, said one of the divers involved in the search.
The Black Box may also be so deep on the seabed that it could only be lifted with a special submarine, it said.The data recorder could be located by the signals that the device sends out after an impact."We were able to narrow down the area in which the Black Box is located to a radius of 100 meters," said the salvage diver.
Today a robot is to be sent down to determine the exact place where the flight writer is located.Its data should provide information about the cause of the accident.In the crash of the Egyptian charter machine last Saturday, all 148 people died on board.
133 of them were French tourists who wanted to fly to Paris with the machine via Cairo.In the past few days, previous passengers and the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZL) have had doubts about the safety of the machines of the Egyptian airline Flash Airlines.However, the Ministries of Transport in France and Egypt had declared that nothing was known about security deficiencies.

Bazl land and overflight ban for 24 aircraft / / (SDA) The interim director of the Federal Civil Aviation (BAZL) Federal Office (BAZL), Max Friedli, explained on Monday evening on Swiss television that in addition to the only machine of the Egyptian Flash Airlines for another 23 planesThere is a ban on land and overflow in Switzerland.However, according to an international “Gentlemen's Agreement”, the names of the affected airlines should remain secret.
The Foundation for Consumer Protection (SKS) now demands that the BAZL will publish a list of the airlines concerned.The “Gentlemen's Agreement” would deliberately jeopardize human life.The SKS calls on Transport Minister Leuenberger in a letter to step in;
Passengers should be able to get an idea of the security of the airlines before departure.The agreement of not publishing the names is applied by the European Civil Aviation Conference and cannot be canceled by Switzerland, a Bazl spokeswoman said on Tuesday.In addition, the names of the airlines are under data protection.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) believes that the public has a right to find out which airlines are affected - but only in serious defects, as the IATA director William Gaillard said.In cases like that of Flash Airlines, the public has the right to be informed.Travel agencies do not know the list only the Bazl should act, but also the travel agencies, the SKS continues.
These should not offer the customers flights with such airlines.The 23 planes are also not known to the travel agencies, said the managing director of the Swiss travel agency association, Walter Kunz.In general, however, an assessment of the safety of aircraft is difficult.
Not the travel agency, but the tour operator decides which airlines are recorded in the package offer, said Kunz.On individual trips, the travel agency shows the various flight options;The customer could then choose.
He could understand why the Bazl does not publish such a list, said Kunz.«That would be a call murder.»

Scrap flyer list, Mr. Leuenberger!/ / ZURICH .Thick post for Minister of Transport Moritz Leuenberger:
His Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) is said to disclose the list of airlines, whose 23 machines are banned from flying (at a glance).The Foundation for Consumer Protection requires this.According to the Bazl interim director Max Friedli, an international “Gentlemen's Agreement” prevents the name of the airlines that use poor aircraft.

Lotter airlines to the pillory / / consumer advocate put pressure: authorities should name names of airlines with air-growing jets.
Experts say more security can only be achieved at European level.By Richard Aschinger, Bernder crash of a charter jet of the Egyptian Flash Airlines into the Red Sea, the security supervision into the crossfire of criticism is moving.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) had declared the only jet of the accident airline in two controls in 2002.
After provisional repairs, both jets were allowed to start in Kloten with passengers.But the Bazl took her with a flight lock for the Swiss territory.As part of a European agreement, the results of these inspections were communicated to the partner countries in the joint database of the “Joint Aviation Authorities”.
Following the rules of this agreement, the Bazl had not announced the public's flight locks.The Foundation for Consumer Protection (SKS) is now describing this practice as "inhuman".So "human life would deliberately jeopardize," it says in an explanation.
In a letter, the SKS Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger asks to intervene in the interest of the security of the flight passengers.The protest was triggered by the statement by the interim Bazl director Max Friedli on Swiss television, and approaching blocks against a further 21 aircraft were in force.For data protection reasons, the BAZL should not give the names of the airlines.
Against one -sided namesake in the federal administration, the opinion of the names of airlines, whose aircraft or crews showed serious defects in inspection for better safety standards, could be increased.The pillory has been a well -known means of prevention since the Middle Ages, says an expert in the Federal Office of Justice.A one -sided publication of the names of affected airlines by Switzerland is assessed as counterproductive.
The international exchange of inspection results only work if the partner countries adhered to the agreed usage restrictions.If information would come to the public in a country, other countries would no longer put their information in the database by referring to their national data protection law.This would result in a deterioration in the security supervision, explains in the Bazl.
In Switzerland, access to the European agreements on data exchange for flight safety controls was expressly only accepted by the data protection officer at the time on the condition that information would only be made accessible.Due to the information from Switzerland, France had inspected Flash Airlines jets three times.According to French sources, these controls in one case would not have serious defects and, in two cases, no complaints.
In Poland, too, the flash airlines jet, which has now crashed, is said to have been inspected once after Swiss checking and qualified as airs.In French newspapers, however, Flash-Airlines passengers are now reporting that report horror experiences.For example, a charter flight is said to be interconnected due to lack of fuel.
Even in the United States, no publication, the United States that has built up an intensive security control system for a long time before Europe, does not publish inspection results.The demand for full transparency has been in the room for years.But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has so far seen more disadvantages.
According to FAA, the large airlines that transport the most passengers far achieve a high security standard, according to FAA.The likelihood of fatal to be fatal in this area of air traffic had dropped from 1967 to the present day from 1 to 2 million to 1 to 1.According to the FAA, a publication of inspection results could endanger the necessary cooperation with the quality airlines.
According to the FAA information published on the Internet, security deficiencies are particularly useful for small airlines in charter traffic.European statistics also show a strikingly higher accident rate for charter companies.

Protest against risk flying / / Federal Councilor Leuenberger should quickly ensure that Swiss passengers are informed about banned “risk aviators” in this country.
A flight writer of the accident machine has been located.Bern.Fat post for the Swiss Aviation Minister in the side office, Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger: "Consumers are not informed about the airplanes that landing is denied at Swiss airports or the overflight over Switzerland," writes the Foundation for Consumer Protection (SKS) to the headof the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication
(Uvek). From Niklaus Ramseyerdie SKS demands that his Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) "publish a list of the names of those Airlines that use blocked machines".If the interim Bazl boss Max Friedli Mein, an international “gentlemen’ s Agreement », is countered by the publication of such a list of dangerous aircraft, then“ this aggreement is inhumane ”.Because: "It deliberately jeopardizes the life of flight passengers." Potential victims
Unsenting controversy, after the tragic crash of an Egyptian aircraft at Sharm El-Sheikh, broke out, which 148 people fell victim to on Saturday.The BAZL then announced that the accident machine was neither started in Switzerland due to technical defects and would have been able to fly over our country: it was on a black list of the office together with 23 other defective aircraft from different companies.
However, this list is "confidential".And only coincidence helped that no Swiss and no Swiss climbed into the plane in Sharm El-Sheikh on Saturday and fell into his death with him, which the responsible Swiss authority had long since banned from her airspace due to inability to fly.
The Swiss travel agencies do not get the information about dangerous aircraft from the Bazl either: if they book flights from foreign airports or from Basel-Mulhouse (BAZ from Tuesday), they may send their customers unintentionally to aircraft that the BAZL has long since objected to.Travel industry will be activated by travel industry has recognized the problem.
"If a tour operator wants to work with an airline, he should be able to find out about the company at the Bazl and also get information," says Walter Kunz, the managing director of the Swiss Travel Agency."We'll meet with representatives of the Bazl this month, and that will be an issue." A topic was the secret crowl for poor civil aircraft just three years ago."The normal passengers sometimes climbed an airplane that Swissair itself classified as a security risk," wrote the "Sonntagsblick" on April 9, 2000 under the title: "Risk Airlines - Swissair leads a black list".
Even then, consumer protection and Bern SP Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga called for the publication of these secret risk list to the tour operators and passengers.Because nothing has happened now.So far, the responsible BAZL has justified its hidden of the 23 risk pilots with data protection and “international agreements”.
However, a Bazl spokesman told “Ten ten to ten” from Tuesday evening that it was ready to discuss the publication of the data.An IATA spokesman, on the other hand, warned that this could be "misinterpreted" in public.In the Foreign Ministry (EDA), however, the responsible department for state contracts "does not know anything about agreements that could be legally effective for Switzerland". One of the flight writers of the aircraft of the Charter airline Flash Airlines crashed into the Red Sea has been located, but has not yet been reserved.

The BAZL should give names / / Air passengers have the right to know which airlines flying feasible jets are flying.This is what the Foundation for Consumer Protection demands in a letter to Federal Councilor Leuenberger.
The Foundation for Consumer Protection (SKS) criticizes the data protection practice of the European Aviation Office by Richard Aschinger, Bern after the crash of a charter jet of the Egyptian Flash Airlines into the Rede Meer.Based on an agreement, results of security inspections are not published.The two aircraft of the accident airline were qualified as "air-adjusted" by the Federal Office for Civil Affairs (BAZL) after controls at Zurich Airport in 2002.
These decisions were not published.21 other aircraft of united airlines are also covered by flight locks of the Bazl.In a letter to Moritz Leuenberger, the SKS writes about a "inhuman" practice.
The foundation requires that the Minister of Transport must ensure that the names of airlines that operate severely poor aircraft are published in the future.As a spokesman for the traffic department explained, Leuenberger received the suggestion.The previous practice will be discussed with the aim of guaranteeing the highest possible security.
SUKKAUS receive consumer advocates from the director of the International Aviation Organization (IATA): The public has a right to experience the names of the responsible airline in serious security defects, says IATA director William Gaillard.No solo by Switzerland experts from the federal administration indicate that inspection reports due to a European agreement would be informed of all partner countries in a common database.
This exchange of information subject to business secrecy would be at risk if Switzerland were solely published by names.Control reports and punitive measures are not published in the United States, which play a pioneering role in terms of security inspections.comment
5. Column, report on page 9 Commentless in the ruin von Roland Schlumpfdie aircraft of the Flash Airlines have no landing permit or flooding rights in Switzerland because their technical condition did not meet the security requirements.This was not only known to the Swiss, but also the French authorities.
Only the passengers of the Boeing 737 - 300, who fell into the sea on Saturday in front of Sharm al -Heikh, most from France, had no idea.The authorities do not want to make their findings public, and the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) does not.Certainly, the Egyptian charter company might have ruined such a publication, because who wants to fly with scrap machines?
But 148 people might still be alive for that.In this weighing up between the protection of economic interests and human lives, the authorities have chosen the economy due to an international agreement.This is not acceptable.
Because thanks to this agreement, the black sheep should become known.It is not about the trivial, but about the serious cases.The crash on Saturday should be open to the members of the agreement.
The Bazl must give names together with the other partners - in the interest of the passengers.Transparency fits badly into a liberalized air traffic market.Consumers should know the risks if they book a flight or a whole travel arrangement.
And the Bazl has to make its contribution, just like the department for foreign affairs repeatedly advises against security and health considerations from trips to certain countries.Ultimately, it will always be due to the consumer whether he wants to fly more or less safely, whether he wants to buy carpets or furniture made of tropical wood or a fur coat from children's hands.The basis for every decision is that everyone can find out everything that is known - transparency.

EUROAIRPORT continued in the downward suction / / fs.Basel, January 7, those responsible for the Swiss-French Airport Basel-Mülhausen focus on Geneva.
While last year an increase in the number of passengers by six percent was recorded for the first time over eight million, the EuroAirport (EAP) had to accept another loss by 18.6 percent to 2.49 million passengers.That is 569,000 passengers less than in the previous year and compared to the record in 2000 with 3.78 million passengers a reduction by 34.2 percent.The frequency of the EAP has dropped to the 1996 status.
With 1.85 million passengers, lines have a minus of 24 percent last year, while the charter or holiday air traffic with 629,000 passengers increased by three percent.In parallel to the decline in passengers, the number of flight movements compared to the previous year fell by 19.3 percent to 88,000. The air freight with a total of 30 057 tons - at the low level - recorded an increase of five percent.
In addition to the effects of the Iraq war and the so-called Sars epidemic, the EAP managers lead as the reasons for the new slump in line traffic, in particular the massive degradation of Swiss destinations from Basel-Mülhausen and frequency reductions on the remaining routes.The passengers transported by the Swiss also decreased by 42.5 percent to a good 760,000.In the best times of Crossair / Swissair, it was 2.2 million or a good 60 percent of all passengers.
The fact that the EAP was affected by the Swissair debacle in particular and the federal government had a lot of subsidized that had caused the Swiss to have a loan of 80 million Swiss francs in Bern two years ago.Despite the affiliated decision, the desire for the EAP is still up to date, as Chairman of the Board of Directors Maurice Amiel explained to the media.This with regard to the massive debt of the EAP in the amount of 165 million euros, which strongly sees the ability to act.
A deficit is likely to result in 2003, although according to VR Vice President Eduard Belser, it is open whether it is covered by the reserve fund or whether the deficit guarantee of France and Switzerland (half of Basel-Stadt) is used for the first time.In the coming year, for the EAP director Jürg Rämi with a decline in passenger numbers of three to five percent, the previously fruitless efforts for the extraction of a low-cost airline are to be continued.In addition, and at all for the traffic upswing, a revision of the fee schedule should help.

Leuenberger oriented Egypt about flight ban / / Bern, Jan 7 (AP) Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger has informed the transport minister of Egypt and France in a condolence letter about the flight ban on the Egyptian airline Flash Airlines since autumn 2002.
After the accident last Saturday, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) had been forced to confirm rumors in the Swiss media that Flash Airlines had been banned from land and overflight for Switzerland since October 2002.This ban was subsequently imposed on two inspections under the Safa program (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft).In the letter to the Egyptian Minister of Transport, Leuenberger emphasized that this ban would not arrange its ministry to do so on the causes of the tragic accident from last Saturday.

In 2002 Boeing had delivered 381 machines, 527 a year earlier and at the height of the global aviation boom even 620. The long -time global industry leader has now been at the lowest level since 1996. Boeing has been significantly stronger than Airbus.
In the meantime, Airbus Boeing has also left significantly in the order stock.While Boeing still have 1112 aircraft of all types in the books, Airbus has deleted an order stock of around 1500.Boing in recent years in its transport aircraft division.CEO Phil Condit recently took his hat off for scandals in the armaments and space.

Now Leuenberger / / The flight ban against Flash Airlines does not allow any conclusions about the cause of the accident in Egypt.This is emphasized by Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger to his colleagues in Paris and Cairo.
Bern.The condolence letters to Gilles de Robien and Ahmed Mohamed Shafik were published on the homepage of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek).The Swiss population and the Federal Council are deeply dismayed by the accident off the Egyptian coast with 148 deaths, writes Leuenberger.
At the same time, he informs the counterparts about the ban on approach and overflow, which Switzerland imposed in October 2002 against the charter company Flash Airlines.Rumors confirmed the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZL) on Saturday after the accident, forced to confirm rumors in the Swiss media via the flight ban for Flash Airlines.The ban was imposed after two inspections as part of the Safa program (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft).
At the same time, Leuenberger emphasizes that the ban on the accident does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the cause of the accident on January 3.His department will forward information about the two inspections to the French authorities.Controversy triggered
Bazl information on the flight ban had triggered a polemic between Switzerland and Egypt at the weekend.Egypt's aviation minister Shafik had stated that he knew nothing about this ban.Corresponding Bazl statements are "irresponsible".
The French Transport Minister Gilles de Robien had already confirmed that his country had been informed by Switzerland about the security deficiencies at Flash Airlines.France did its own samples.Funeral celebrations provided
Days after the plane crash on the Red Sea, 109 survivors from France traveled to Sharm El-Sheikh.The relatives were accompanied by doctors, psychologists and clergymen.France sent additional police officers to Sharm El-Heikh to advance the investigation into the cause of the accident.
For this Thursday, funeral celebrations are intended on the beach of Sharm El-Heikh and at the scene of the accident off the coast.Sdaunglückspraschmaschmen in front of the crash regular course.According to French information, the accidentally pronounced Egyptian charter machine flew "an irregular course" before falling into the Red Sea.
The problems would have started shortly after the start and a first planned curve, said French Transport Secretary Dominique Bus Sereu.The machine had not increased steadily, but in several stages and kept the respective intermediate height in between.Finally, the machine started a descent that ended tragically.
The reason for this flight behavior is still unclear, said Bus Seau.The French experts on site could only have evaluated the radar data.The flight writers should bring closer information as soon as they are safe.

Only the Geneva Airport has increased / / The passenger balance of the airports Zurich, Basel and Geneva in 2003 failed very differently: in Zurich, passenger numbers went back by around 5 % and they collapsed in Basel by 19 % - only Geneva made a new oneRecord number.
Basel / Zurich / Geneva.Now the figures of all three large country airports in Switzerland are available.The EuroAirport has the strongest loss in passenger traffic at 19 % (cf. BAZ from yesterday).
On Thursday, Zurich Airport presented its (preliminary) numbers.From Stefan Schupplider decline from 5.1 % to 17.0 million passengers was less bad than feared, as the Unique company company reports.The Geneva Airport swings upstairs:
The increase is 6.1 %, the number of passengers, as already reported, rose to the new record of 8.1 million.Why these big differences?Both Zurich and Basel suffer from the massive dismantling of Swiss.
In contrast, the great mining took place in Geneva in 1996 when the Swissair largely withdrew there.Geneva managed to compensate for the failure in the following years - for the industry for a good years.The low -cost airline Easyjet has jumped into the gap, which contested more than 25 % of traffic in Geneva.
Easyjet also gained 20 % there last year, other airlines have an increase of 10 %.Swiss, in turn, also dismantled something in Geneva.Geneva benefits from very strong England traffic, whereby more and more British ski tourists are relying on flight connections to Geneva, says Philippe Clapasson, a member of the Geneva Airport, takes you over BAZ.
This year, growth is expected, which should be something below 2003.For Basel, the breakdown coincides with the largest crisis in the civil aviation.In addition, low -cost airlines like Easyjet have already established themselves in Geneva and Zurich, so it will be difficult to lure them to Basel.
The EuroAirport is now trying to become more attractive for airlines with a new fee schedule.Plans to offer charter long-haul flights from Basel have broken up for the time being.Smaller new airlines were only able to compensate for the massive failure of the Swiss marginal.
Small bright spot: The German tour operator “Flieg-AB-Basel-DE” wants to start the new season with Swiss.The internet-oriented travel agency “noticeable impulses for the regional travel business, for the Swiss and the EuroAirport promises from this cooperation.»At the beginning of April, the first Swiss machines are to take off towards Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, Rhodes, Crete and Tunisia.
Corfu and Hurgada are to follow later.Zurich is still at the Swiss tip.In the top years, over 21 million passengers were handled there.
Since the Swiss end and the dismantling of the Swiss, it has been becoming less and less.The flight movements also decrease on an ongoing basis: with 269 392, it was 4.5 % less last year than in the previous year.
Unique does not want to announce what the decline for the earnings page means until the end of March.In the last quarter, however, passenger demand continued, funded by deep flight prices, and also developed over in December.For the new year, the general director of the international air traffic association Iata, Giovanni Bisignani, expects growth of 7 to 8 percent in the aviation industry.
The spokesman for the organization, William Gaillard, also says: "The industry should be able to make profits this year." Yawning emptiness.The airports Basel and Zurich had to take setbacks last year.While Basel suffered a lot, Geneva had a plus.
2004
In the future, more flights / / last year only 269,000 starts and landings took place in Kloten.A low point.
Now Unique is hoping for the turn.Von Erwin Haa's "minus 5.1 percent", Zurich Airport summarizes its 2003 traffic statistics.Kloten used 17 million passengers last year as the starting point or destination of their travels, one million less than in the previous year.
The number of starts and landings decreased from 282,000 to a good 269,000 (minus 4.5 percent).The proportion of transfer passengers dropped from 38.4 percent in 2002 to 34.7 percent - not least because the Swiss, which generates three fifths of commercial traffic in Kloten, reduced its fleet and its international route network and the proportion cheaperInner European direct flights from Zurich have risen sharply.The decline in air traffic figures has been confirmed for the third time in a row - this time due to fear of terrorist, Sars and Iraq war.
But the aviation industry expects more traffic in the long term.After 40 years of growth, which rose to a leak, especially in the 1990s, Zurich Airport had booked a record in 2000: 325,000 starts and landings (twice as many as 1980), almost 22.7 million passengers.Then came September 11, 2001, the terrorist attack in New York, shortly afterwards the Grounding of the Swissair.
Since then it has only been down.Unique is currently not making any forecasts for the future development of the Zurich passenger and movement numbers.The flight business has become more short -lived, the airport ventures into its balance sheet press conference at the end of March.
Despite the air traffic, the statement by District President Christian Huber that Zurich Airport will "never reach 350,000 flight movements in the next ten years".According to Thomas Koller from the airport -friendly committee for a cosmopolitan Zurich, airports record 5 to 7 percent growth per year "if the economy is running".Air traffic “twice as fast as the gross national product” .350,000 movements in 2010? The aircraft manufacturer Boeing expects 5.1 percent more passengers every year for the next 20 years and 6.4 percent more freight.
By 2022, the global passenger and cargo jet fleet will more than double and grow on 34,000 aircraft.Airbus expects growth of 4.5 percent per year.If you calculate an increase of 5 percent per year in Zurich, you will get 350,000 movements in 2010.
The number of movements would double within 14 years.Whether Zurich Airport will enjoy such growth depends not only on the global economic development, but above all on the thrive of the main customer Swiss and her role alongside British Airways in the OneWorld alliance.The largest growth is predicted to the air traffic market in Asia, especially in the economically strengthening China.
However, experts agree that traffic in Europe will also grow again.The trend towards cheap direct flights with regional jets has already been felt in recent years.The EU east expansion will significantly increase the number of connections.

Waiting ban in front of toilet / / If you fly to the USA, you should drink as little as possible or at best have the night pot at hand.Basel.
- The security precautions of the US authorities are increasingly striking: since December 24th it has been forbidden to form queues in front of the toilets on flights to the USA.The US Transport Security Authority (TSA) has addressed the new regulation to all airlines - including the Swiss.
According to the instructions, for safety reasons, passengers are no longer allowed to gather in groups in any area of the aircraft - especially in the vicinity of the washrooms.Swiss passengers would be informed about the new regulation before departure from the pilot, said Swiss spokesman Dominik Werner."The ban requires a certain degree of common sense, both in the crew and the passengers," said Werner.
The cabin staff must decide from which number of waiting for the toilets it was a group accumulation - the TSA did not give any numbers.The passengers, in turn, would have to wait on their seats until they are their turn and discuss each other."So far there have been no problems," said Werner.
The United States has also started to record travelers in Australia on Monday.At 115 airports, fingerprints are taken by entrants and photos are taken.
The controls based on biometric data are also to be introduced in Australia.The identification system uses digital technology to record the faces of the travelers, said a spokesman for the Ministry of customs.So far, the recording had been used solely in the crews of the airline Qantasen.

Wander and confused / / Christian Huber: "We are currently losing ground", TA 5. 1. The Zurich CFO complains that the economy is doing badly because the airport is in difficulties.
This way of thinking is one of the reasons for the misery.The airport and the Swiss (Air) are encouraged in a way that is reminiscent of religious fundamentalism, in the erroneous assumption when the two are doing well, the economy is also fine.You can also give a remote region a chance of development if you build a traffic route there.
However, economic development only takes place when this region offers something that finds great demand.If this offer is not there and the traffic route is not, on the other hand, there is always an investor.If the world is convinced of the economic offer of Zurich, business people and tourists come to Zurich.
Airport and Swiss or not.If we do our economic homework right, we don't need to worry about the airport and Swiss.Let us continue to take care of them, and continues to atrophy our economy.

London publishes Black List of Airlines / / Inspired by a parliamentary request, the Ministry of Transport in London has published a list of those airlines, against which a flight ban for British airspace is imposed for security reasons.The Swiss Office for Civil Aviation does not want to join this step for the time being.PGP.
London, 8th Januardie British government, published a list of airlines from eight countries on Thursday, against which a flight ban has been banned from British for security reasons.These are all airlines from Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia and Tajikistan as well as Albanian Airlines, Cameroon Airlines, Central Air Express from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Star Air and Air Universal from Sierra Leone.In the “rigorous British security regime”, according to the Transport Ministry, flight licenses are revoked or denied if international standards are not met and if airplanes are not equipped with sufficient collision warning systems.
In addition, the non -paying of buses due to offenses against entry regulations can also be the reason to withdraw traffic law to an airline.The Ministry of Transport in London did not publish such black lists in the Unterhausbisher.It has now changed the practice in answering a parliamentary request from conservative MP David Wilshire.
The latter took the point of view when a government issued flight bans, she had to have good reasons for it, and the public has the right to be informed.The reason for the request was the announcement in Bern that the machine of the Egyptian Flash Airlines, which crashed into the Red Sea last Saturday, was banned from flying in Switzerland.However, the names of other airlines that are on the black list have not yet been published there.
It remains to be seen whether British openness will lead to a change in Swiss information policy.In turn, the British government is not willing to name airlines that were imposed on flight bans in other countries;That is the responsibility of the states concerned itself, it is said from the Ministry of Transport.
According to the BBC, in 2002 (the official list for the last year is not yet available), Belgium and the Netherlands imposed bans in Europe.According to the same source, two companies banned in other European countries can fly to Great Britain.In Great Britain, a debate about the use of armed security officers (Sky Marshalls) in passenger aircraft is also underway in Great Britain.
A year ago, the government initiated a corresponding training program.Armed officials have apparently not been used in British airlines.The reservoir of suitable people is small because only a small part of the British police officers has experience in dealing with firearms.
After the United States has strengthened the pressure on the use of armed Sky Marshalls in recent weeks, the Ministry of Transport is trying to establish guidelines in agreement with the airlines and the British line pilot association.So far, it is known that in British aircraft on the pilot's command of the pilot's command and that the safety officers for passengers should only take action if the machine is acute.Bern keeps a black list for you.

Warts in front of toilets are now prohibited on flights to the USA.The ban on all airlines, such as the spokesman for the Swiss Airline Swiss, Dominik Werner, said.According to the TSA show, passengers are no longer allowed to gather in groups in any area of the aircraft, especially in the vicinity of the washrooms.
Swiss passengers would be informed about the regulation that has been in effect since December 24, said Werner."The ban requires a certain common sense, both in the aircraft crew and the passengers," said the Swiss spokesman.It is due to the cabin staff to decide which number of waiting people in front of the aircraft toilets is a group accumulation because the TSA did not specify this more precisely.

Switzerland does not publish black list for the time being / / London / Bern.Sda.
The Department of Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger does not want to publish the list of 23 aircraft with landing ban in Switzerland for the time being.First of all, delicate data protection and liability law issues would have to be clarified.However, a spokeswoman for the Eidg said that a deadline for the clarification was not set.

Uvek does not announce aircraft with flight ban / / Bern, Jan 9 (AP) In Switzerland, the information about the aircraft occupied with a flight ban is not made known for the time being.
The request for the announcement of the list was described as understandable in a communication by the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek) from Friday.However, she asked delicate data protection and liability law questions.These would now have to be carefully clarified.
Because these planes are not allowed to fly to Switzerland, there is no acute need for action.Incidentally, the meaningfulness of information about the machines occupied with a flight ban is limited because the sample controls of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) are a snapshot of an aircraft.Conclusions to the entire fleet of a society are neither possible nor permissible.

No black list of the EU for air traffic / / London, Jan 9 (dpa) The European Union has reacted with a reserved black list of dangerous air traffic societies.
A spokesman for the traffic commissioner said in Brussels on Friday that the EU Commission has no such list in the drawer.For years, a law has been discussed in the EU that provides for an annual report on aircraft examinations in the EU.Lists with the names of airlines, the applications of which were rejected for a landing permit, are kept secret in common practice.

The Federal Office for Civil Aviation regularly conducts sample controls for foreign aircraft at Swiss airports, it said.However, these controls are a snapshot of an aircraft and did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the entire fleet of a company.Great Britain surprisingly published his black list of airlines on Thursday, which, due to various violations, have no landing permit (TA from yesterday).
The EU reacted reluctantly to London's airline list on Friday.The EU Commission itself does not have such lists in the drawer, announced from EU circles.(Sda)

Air traffic with rockets and headlights disturbed / / mbm.In the early Saturday morning, the Zurich cantonal police received a message that a pilot was blinded with a headlight when I was flight to Zurich Airport.
In the Gockhausen area, there was also a fireworks rocket against a landing plane.As the cantonal police report in agreement with the Uster district, two men aged 66 and 68 were temporarily arrested and checked due to these reports in Gockhausen.The men wanted to demonstrate with their lamps against the recently introduced southern trips to Zurich Airport.
The airport operator Unique finally announced that on Saturday morning, a total of three pilots in the Gockhausen area had found bright spotlights between 6 a.m. 8 p.m. and 7 a.m., which was deliberately aimed at the passenger aircraft in the landing approach.Another pilot was also disturbed in the Gockhausen area by climbing a fireworks rocket in the concentration on the landing.The two men arrested by the cantonal police admitted that they had lit up with small hand headlights on approaching aircraft.
However, they did not want to be responsible for firing fireworks rockets.They would not have the slightest to do with that, they put a record.The Uster District Attorney is now carrying out further investigations and will also have to state any criminal consequences for the pensioners.
There is a discussion about hazardous traffic.At the Swiss airline, it was found out on request that such disruptions had occurred several times with headlights, most recently on Monday a week.Although these were uncomfortable and the pilots distracted in an unnecessary manner on the landing approach, but they are no longer worrying or even dangerous.
The interference effect is not too large and comparable to a car on the street, the handlebars of which let the headlights turned on.On the other hand, the Swiss is rated far more questionable and more dangerous to fire fireworks on aircraft.The unique wants to act against the blinding and tanning and prohibit them.
An advertisement has already been received by the cantonal police in this matter.Opponents of the southern trips described the cantonal police 'approach as completely disproportionate and exaggerated.The house search and the identification treatment of the two men were not necessary.

House search at two southern approach opponents / in Gockhausen, the cantonal police arrested two pensioners on Saturday morning and searched their houses.The southern approach opponents had ignited to heaven with headlights.
By Susanne Andereggadrian Schoop (69) was on his way home shortly before seven o'clock when he was stopped by a patrol of the cantonal police.In his hand, he was wearing the headlight with which he had previously illuminated from a meadow in Gockhausen to the sky."A loud conversation" developed, as Schoop says.
That caused his neighbor's attention.Paul Hodel (67) stood on the balcony at that time to show his grandson the early morning southern trips.Hodel had also lit to the sky with a hand headlight and expressed his anger about the noise.
Hodel went on the street to see what was going on, whereupon the police also asked him.The headlights were removed from the two pensioners, and the police took them to the Dübendorf post."There was an interrogation with a protocol," says Schoop, "and then we were informed that we were arrested for disruption to public transport.»
But that was not all .Suddenly it was said that you had to make a house search.The two pensioners allowed this without a search order.
"Every drawer in the house and every kitchen box is open," said Schoop.Afterwards it went on to the cripple building in Zurich, where the pensioners were recorded.Schoop counted over 30 fingerprints - "an absolute ratio of ratio," says the former textile large.
Because what they would have done was not dangerous, he knew that from his own view;He had been sitting in the cockpit several times (as a "passenger with relationships").Neighbor Paul Hodel, formerly stock market boss at a Zurich bank, sees that immediately:
«We just ignite a bit in heaven, not directly on the planes.»The pensioners bought their hand headlights at Coop at the campaign price of CHF 39.90 instead of CHF 70.According to their own information, they needed them at most once a week.
A unique spokesman confirmed on Sunday that the safety of air traffic had never been endangered.Domes in the event of the cantonal police, the cantonal police had become active at the instigation of Unique.
This had reported to the police that three pilots in the Gockhausen area had found headlights that were aimed at approaching passenger aircraft.A pilot had also observed an ascending fireworks rocket.According to the unique spokesman, the light campaigns of southern approach opponents have increased recently: “We have pilots' complaints almost every day.»
Unique has therefore switched on the cantonal police several times.The arrests from Saturday are the result of increased police controls.Now the Uster District Attorney is investigating.
For Thomas Morf, President of the Association of Flugsenise Süd - no, it is clear: “There was an example.“It is an attempt to break the resistance.

Air travelers in the United States under the magnifying glass / / The American security authorities are planning to introduce a new system for electronic review of all flight passengers despite the resistance of interest groups.From their data, conclusions about the terrorist risk that the individual travelers runs is to be drawn.
A. R. Washington, January 12th «a normal and a special one!“At Washington Airport, a control officer grumbles over his shoulder and indicates the two travelers at the safety lock.While the "normal" only has to pass the metal detector, the "special" is led to a separate table, where a ten -minute check of hand luggage, clothing and shoes begins.
The special treatment is by no means surprising: clearly recognizable, for security officers as well as for terrorists, the abbreviation “SSS” stood on the board card - the computer's darn that this passenger deserved a particularly precise control because of his data.The airline had already been so nice to point out the upcoming review.
This means that you have to expect a last minute ticket to buy.But not only short -term bookings, but also tickets without a return flight or the purchase in cash instead of a credit card are factors that justify the predicate "SSS" for the computer.The underlying assumption states that people with such buying behavior represent a larger terrorism than others.
Fixing a color code for every passenger traveler only because of their skin color or other racial characteristics is considered politically incorrect in the USA, so that you usually prefer to rely on supposedly objective criteria such as the above.But the authority for traffic safety (TSA) created after the 2001 attacks has long since realized that the current system, computer-assisted Passenger Passenger Pre-Screening Program (Capps), can be too easily overturned.A new version of Capps II is therefore planned, which includes a much wider data background during the electronic preliminary examination.
As the Washington Post reports, the program is to be enforced this year against the resistance of airlines and political groups, which fear an unreasonable state interference in the personality sphere.As early as February, the instructions to American airlines and travel agencies could be found to send TSA all passenger data, similar to how the United States has previously requested from foreign companies.The control using Capps II should then be carried out in two stages.
Due to the passenger information - name, address, telephone number, date of birth, travel route - is initially determined in large databases, as also used, for example, credit card companies to clarify the creditworthiness of a customer, the probability that the passenger has given its correct identity.After that, the information is compared to the criminal and terrorist databases by police and secret services.At the end of this procedure, each passenger receives a color code that should provide the security officers information about their “dangerousness”.
“Green” travelers will have normal control to go through, “yellow” a special examination, while “red” preventing the aircraft.The TSA does not assure a perfect system skeptic that the new system will no longer give customers, but fewer inconvenience.
The authority estimates that 5 percent of those affected would receive the "red" or "yellow" rating, while Capps I currently have to undergo 15 percent of a special check.Fears in front of a surveillance state is countered with the argument that the delicate passenger data would only be kept for a few days.At the same time, a program desired by the travel industry is in planning that would pave the way to a abbreviated security procedure as a harmless traveler.
But the new programs will undoubtedly be outwitted, especially by terrorist “sleeping”, who have been preparing for an assassination in the country for years without ever noticing the authorities.Persistent terrorist praise.R. Although the American government declared a reduced terrorist alarm level on Friday, the authorities continue to warn of attacks.
The second highest alarm level (“Code Orange”) had temporarily met over the Christmas and New Years.The Ministry of domestic security had spoken of plans for a terrorist campaign that could be the same for the attacks in September 2001.In the meantime it remained calm;
It is unclear whether an assassination was thwarted or not.Despite the lower alarm level, the tightened safety regulations remain at eight airports - allegedly in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Las Vegas.They are considered to be particularly at risk and said from the secret services that the suspects from terrorist circles have hardly decreased since the holidays.
Al Qaeda apparently continues to plan attacks with aircraft.During the holidays, at least 15 foreign flights to America were canceled for security reasons.So far, none of the evidence that led to the cancellations does not seem to have been confirmed.
There were occasional overreactions - for example in the case of an Arabian who was prevented from flying in Paris because her heated motorcyclist jacket had triggered a false alarm.After landing in Cincinnati, the other passengers had to sit for an hour until they were allowed to get out.In the United States, the authorities in Las Vegas examined the data of all hotel guests for terrorist compounds.
In several cities, special officials were on the road with violinist to search for "dirty" bombs.No friends made himself on Saturday the spinner who spent a false bomb warning during a flight from New York to Washington.The machine was redirected, the man arrested.

Criminal proceedings against Morf / / The well -known southern approach opponent Thomas Morf threatens a prison sentence.According to a report from Radio Zürisee, the Ustermer district lawyer Hans-Jakob Weiss has opened criminal proceedings against Thomas Morf.
He examines whether he as President of the Association of Flugsenisen Süd - No committed an instigation to disrupt public transport.If this fact is fulfilled, he threatens a prison sentence.At the end of July last year, the association had switched to an advertisement in various regional newspapers, in which a slightly stringing plane was depicted that flew over exploding fireworks.
The words "At the end of October the forest fire was over".Many readers understood this as a request to not fire the August 1st missiles in autumn-when the southern trips were introduced to Kloten Airport.As a result, a criminal complaint went against Thomas Morf.
District lawyer Weiss had the police hear him and asked experts how dangerous such rockets are.The answers were enough for him to initiate a procedure.Thomas Morf looks calmly towards the result.
«Obviously someone overreacted.We didn't say anyone to fire with the rockets on planes, »he said.He will not be intimidated by an advertisement and will continue his fight against the southern trips.

“Lämppen” for lamps / / house search at South Arrivals, TA from January 12th.Fingerprints only because of a few cheap stoves?
You almost feel like in America!But the men's excuses are more than ridiculous.Are the planes so high that you have to search for them first with the headlight to show them to the grandson?
But fun aside: those who have most reason to disturb air traffic would be in the north;If you do not land north, you will start.This would also give us a lot more ways to disrupt public transport.
However, we still believe that the aircraft noise question should be solved objectively and legally.Stephan Ebnöther, Weiahain great praise "A Oisi Guete Manne" for the courageous commitment;
Because what is right must remain right.Now that David was made in Gockhausen, I wonder whether the police and judiciary still have so much civil courage to also cope with Goliath in Kloten.Giordano Pauli, Zurichalle attempts to defend himself against the low -floats with legal means.
There is emergency law.Now two major fathers have been picked up with flashlights.Is it criminal to go with a flashlight around his house to scare away intruders?
If a burglar penetrates my apartment, I can defend myself, I thought so far.Now I rather believe that a curfew will soon be imposed on the Pfannenstiel and Schwamendingen.As long as this is not yet the case, the walkers at the Pfannenstiel would have to endure a security check.
Early in the morning with headlights and noise that makes everything vibrate from being torn out of sleep is torture.The polluters are prestigious people and institutions, no police agents for them, no dish does what.We just have to endure it because the powerful ones want it.
I feel right.Renate Krenn, Zurichzwei angrily adorned over the southern flights, perhaps in their fainting via the illegal air road over their houses, also bitter pensioners directed flashlights on the lands that fly 300 meters above ground.I can only hope that the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, perhaps even the responsible Federal Council, will take note of this incident and seriously consider whether against the Swiss, but certainly against the pilot involved in this incident, immediately and with refusal to deny all the right to complain.Tag flight ban »would have to be imposed.

Black list: Now politicians are putting printing / / now politicians in Porspers are calling for the publication of the list of airlines with security defects.The refusal of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) to publish the list of aircraft with safety defects is increasing for growing criticism.
Legal measures are now required in two parliamentary advances.In a postulate, the Bernese SVP National Councilor Rudolf Joder calls on the "necessary legal adjustments" so that air traffic companies that have security deficiencies will be publicly known in the future.Both pilots and passengers have a right to know which aviation company they have to do with regard to security, argues Joder.
In this regard, in Switzerland, as in other countries, transparency should be created.Guarantee The Valais FDP National Councilor Jean-René Germanier goes a little further than a joder.In his opinion, the publication of the list, on which he also insists, is not sufficient.
In his motion, he demands that consumers receive "binding information" when buying a plane ticket about the company with which they will fly.This is not guaranteed today.Germanier refers to the French Transport Minister Gilles de Robien, who proposed a corresponding change in the law on January 6 of last year.
Problem Codesharingsupport receives Germanicians from FDP press chief Christian Weber.This refers to the problem of so -called codesharing.
If you book a certain airline, you may have to fly with a partner company of this company.The conditions in charter business are even more opaque, where transport is often organized at very short notice.It is therefore important that customers are informed about the society with which they fly, writes Weber in the FDP press service.
After the tragic plane crash at Sharm El-Heikh, the Bazl had explained that it had a black list of 21 aircraft with safety defects.Citing international agreements, it refuses to publish.HO

Swiss locates positive trend / / the massive dismantling at Swiss seems to bear fruit: the occupancy of the aircraft has risen sharply in the fourth quarter, reports the airline.
However, it is not yet clear what it looks like financially.· Dominic Ramel "The adjustments in the network and the new European concept showed a positive effect in the fourth quarter of 2003," said Swiss yesterday.
The average occupancy of all aircraft in the fourth quarter in the previous year was increased by 4.2 percentage points to 75 percent.In Europe, the so -called seat load factor rose by 8.4 percentage points to 61.7 percent, and 0.8 percentage points on intercontinental flights to 80.4 percent.Swiss sees a positive trend in the development of occupancy since October and speaks of a "pleasant November" and a "strong December".
In particular, the new tariff and booking system in European traffic with low prices developed positively.In Europe, the expenses of the aircraft increased by 9.7 percentage points in October in the previous year and 7.4 percentage points each in November and December.More clarity only in March this development is pleasant in itself.
It shows that the restructuring applies, at least as far as the utilization figures are concerned.However, traffic statistics do not emphasize whether this also applies to income.Because this says nothing about the prices at which the seats were sold.
Swiss is currently offering European lies at bargain prices from CHF 49.Whether this bill for the airline is still relatively high in comparison with the low-cost pilots?Swiss will publish the financial key figures on March 23.
Only then will it be shown how it looks the bottom line.It will be particularly important how big the outflow of money was in the fourth quarter.At the end of September, the liquidity was still CHF 654 million.
It could soon fall below the critical mark of CHF 300 million.In the first nine months, Swiss suffered a loss of CHF 609 million.Provisions of CHF 205 million have negatively influenced the result in the third quarter.
Massively shrinked the traffic figures for 2003 show how strongly Swiss broke down: In Europe, the number of kilometers on offer was 31.1 percent below the previous year's value;In the intercontinental area it was 16.1 percent.
SWISS promoted a total of 10.66 (previous year: 11.57) millions of passengers.The average occupancy of all aircraft was 72.4 (71) percent.In Europe, the seat load factor was 59.6 (56.9) percent, 78 (80.3) percent in intercontinental transport.

More than an intermediate high at Swiss?/ / nz.The Swiss traffic figures for December convey a picture that stands out from previous data.Leaving the customers at the end of 2002 due to the impending Iraq war and frightened by terrorist attacks as a precaution, the situation has now returned to normal.
But how sustainable is the demand to be accumulated, which is reflected in the recovery of the SWISS seat load factor in December compared to the same month in the previous year by 5.9 percentage points to 74.6 %?For two reasons, the day should not be praised before the evening.First, the Swiss Just has massively thinned out its route network with the introduction of the winter flight plan (end of October).
On a consolidated basis, i.e. European and intercontinental transport, the capacities were reduced by 21.1 % in December, whereas the yields, measured on the kilometers sold, fell by 14.2 %.The quiz question now is whether the costs could be reduced accordingly or not.The second moment of uncertainty lies in the earnings development, which cannot be derived approximately on the basis of the transport numbers that have just been delivered.
In contrast to Air France and Lufthansa, which increased its seat load factors by 5.4 or 1.4 percentage points in December, the Swiss has improved its performance in the middle of a hard restructuring phase.It can be assumed that the big airlines have managed better than the Swiss to attract more and, above all, better paying passengers on their only gradually adapted route network.British Airways announced that they welcomed 5 % more business customers on board on the North Atlantic routes in December.
Undoubtedly, more customers flew to America with the Swiss in December;It is all the more painful that the destination Washington and a flight to Newark were painted.Satisfaction with Airbusug.
(Paris) Now it is official, so to speak: European aircraft producer Airbus has overtaken the US competitor Boeing.
In 2003 Airbus delivered 305 aircraft, which corresponds to sales of 19.3 billion euros, while Boeing only completed 281 commercially used aircraft.The joy of the management is unmistakable and not undeserved.Although the market was extremely unsure, more units were discontinued than in 2002 (303) -, as sales director John Leahy emphasizes, at higher prices.
The 284 new festive orders with a catalog value of $ 32.8 billion correspond to a market share of 54.2 % and help to ensure that the order stock of 1454 aircraft secures the production of the next five years.CEO Noël Forgeard attributes the success to a competitive product range, which he describes as the most modern and most comprehensive in the industry and which the “double -decker” A380 will also include, the first flight of which is planned for 2005.He assumes a still weak market with almost 300 deliveries this year, but he is confident that Airbus will benefit from the market recovery as soon as it comes.
But the trees don't grow into heaven.The strength of Airbus is partly due to its own performance.But Boeing's weakness also played a role.
As the British commentator John Kay thinks, one had forgotten to concentrate on securing the market leadership.Rather, one spoke of value-related environment, unit costs, yield of investments and “shareholder return”.The waiver of innovation took revenge in a loss of market shares.
But Boeing has reoriented itself, approved the first new aircraft program for over a decade - 7E7 - and set off to regain lost soil.Richemont - gratifying for Swatcham.The quarterly sales of the Swiss luxury goods group Richemont have pleasantly surprised most observers.
The weak dollar and the weak yen once again ensured a 4 % decline in sales at the company in euro.In local currencies, however, sales between October and December expanded by 4 %, whereby the business was booming, especially in America (+18 %) and in Asia (+20 %).These are not only good news for Richemont, but for the entire luxury goods industry:
At least in some regions, the luxury goods market has recovered significantly in the past three months.The climate seems to be particularly cheap for the manufacturers.In any case, this is the area in which Richemont was able to grow most by far with growth in local currencies of 11 %.
Should the watch market actually recover, the Swatch Group could benefit the most from all luxury goods groups.The group, headed by Nick Hayek, makes around 90 % of its sales in the watch area, while for example at Richemont, at LVMH, Gucci, Hermès or Bulgari, even less.

From the sky, when he came from and slowly, slowly / / you don't have to travel to a star to find rubble from space.The grandmother of a Utzenstorfer observed the impact of a meteorite in front of her house, 75 years ago.
· Mischa Aebier could have fallen on your head, could have hit a house roof, but did not do it, instead landed in a open field in Utzenstorf, the meteorite.The meteorite of Utzenstorf.Again and again the Utzenstorfer Marie Egger described the event to her grandson Hans-Peter Egger.
Schweif in front of the window was in the evening after a very hot summer day, August 16, 1928. Heavy storm clouds in the sky above the village on the Emme.Grandmother was in the kitchen, in the Stöckli on the Eystrasse, observed lightning, the grandson says.
Suddenly it had become Taghell, she reported that a shining tail "went to the ground" less than two hundred meters from the kitchen window."It was a fire ball," she said.In view of the thunderstorm, she suspected that it was a flash, "a special support", a "ball flash".
Babbled on the ground, he continued to glow during seconds.Why not borrow?But it was not a flash, not even a spherical flash, but another much rarer appearance, just a meteorite, still glowing, a chunk out of space.
A little larger than a fist, 3422 grams heavy.Today the lump is behind thick glass panes in the Natural History Museum in Bern Scientists tore around the gift of space.And Hans-Peter Egger, the grandson, is still upset today: «Gopfridstutz, the grandmother would only have given him a loan.»
Because the grandson knows how rare the find is: In total, only eight meteorites have been found in Switzerland.The Utzenstorfer is the third largest and the best search.
Several scientists devoted studies to the clump from space.Crater in front of the Hufereiner coincidence that today you know that grandmother Eggers Kugelblitz was a meteorite.The tenant of the Eggerhof discovered days after the impact - he was on the field with fields and horse on the field - a large hole in front of the hooves of the Gäbs, a pitch -black crater in the open field.
Astonished, ignorant and nothing he had lifted the lump he found in the hole.And - as it belonged - the owners of the country, that was Grossmutter Egger.Another random thanks to which a certain Ernst Scheidegger, teacher from Schaufelbühl, heard about whom puzzling find, today you know that the stone from the crater is a meteorite.
He is said to have watched the stone, immediately expressed the assumption, brought him to Bern to the investigation, and soon it was reported: Yes, a meteorite, a real one.This can be read in a brochure from the Swiss Association of Remales and Mineral Collectors · Aarberg noise around «Little Big Shop» The Avec Shop in Aarberg cannot be opened in spring.

The President of the Aarberg shop, Beat Roder, also does not respond pleasantly: «Experience shows that stores outside the town such as Coop or the petrol station shop do not attract any additional customers into the Stedtli.»In the AVEC shop, goods and services from Migros, SBB AG and« K Kiosk AG »are to be offered in the franchising system on a sales area of 170 square meters.
The fact that the Avec shop cannot be opened in spring, but only in August, regrets its future managing director Christoph Marte.He is expected to be the only one of the eight planned employees temporarily."The regular staff at the SBB kiosk in Aarberg will switch to Avec without notice period," knows
"He." The entrepreneurs are still too little informed, "said Marte.At the end of January, unification negotiations are scheduled for the government governor."There will be no noise pollution, only short parkers," promises Marte.
In the goods head that is canceled, 29 “Park + Ride” places, two disabled parking spaces and 38 “Bike + Ride” places are to be created.According to Marte, Bahnhofstrasse with Postbuses and parking cars is “already very busy”.This can confirm this by the resident Verena Glatz, who has collected signatures against the construction project with the residents of the apartment buildings at the sawn.
Traffic has doubled in the past 24 years, and there has been no rest at night.Now she fears additional noise around the AVEC shop on weekends and on working days with truck noise when delivering goods.Bjbneue opening times of the Aarberg train station: Mon to Fri from 7.40 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., from 1.30 p.m. to 5.15 p.m., Saturday and Sunday.

Horror accident: SWISS pilot spoken / / / A French dish spoke to the Swiss pilot, who caused the death of three Swiss in 2002 on the airport road to the euro airport, for the negligent killing for yesterday.
The relatives of two victims were present in the trial.Mulhouse.Ama.
On April 5, 2002, three people died on the airport road between Basel and the euro airport at a frontal collision.The person who caused the accident, a Swiss pilot of Slovak nationality, was injured, but was able to leave the hospital after almost four weeks.Since the connecting road to the airport is located on French territory, the process took place yesterday in Mulhouse.
The indictment was on a negligent killing, the judgment on two years in prison on probation, two years of driving ban in France and 2000 euros in fine.All three victims, the 24-year-old student Céline Berger, who had directed the car and her two passengers, the 36-year-old Basel artist Mona Stefan Dähler and 48-year-old Yves Konrad were Swiss.On the accident evening, they were on the road for the clear view of the airport to see the stars from there.
The pilot oncoming to them was on the way home to Riehen when he met the car of the correctly accommodating three victims after passing a passed line.There was no alternative, since the street is limited at this point from a concrete wall and a fence.All three victims were immediately dead, their car burned out.
Relatives of two sacrifices negotiation at the "Grande Tribunal D’ Instance "(Cantonal Court) were relatives of two victims, but not as co -plaintiffs.The accused's insurance claims had already compensated for liability and damages in Switzerland.The pilot, which flew again and a half months after the accident, lost his job in October last year in the course of the Swiss detection wave and was represented by a defense lawyer.
The 54-year-old and father of two children said that after a single flight on the accident, I had no reason to overtake any reason or the intention, although the cars drove very slowly in front of me (approx. 50 instead of the allowed 90 km /h - d.I also knew the route that I drove almost every day.“How the accident could not understand, he can no longer understand, possibly as a result of a second sleep.
"Suddenly I saw the car right in front of me and tried to avoid." However, the pilot's statement contradicts the three witnesses from different vehicles that speak of a conscious overtaking process.According to the vehicle behind him, the pilot had put the turn signal behind it.A second witness said that the accused did not use an existing gap in the insert, but also set to overtake the third car driving in front of her.
The court decided on negligent killing, which can be punished in France with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros.According to the indictment of the relatives at the driver, a blood alcohol content of 2.13 per thousand was found despite the contradiction between the relatives.Prescription to
However, the judgment classified the judgment as irrelevant because it had behaved properly.The relatives of the victims present in Mulhouse agreed with the comparatively mild judgment.While Celine Berger's family had been in contact with the person who caused the accident for a long time, Däher's father met him for the first time in Mulhouse.
After the verdict, the pilot turned to the relatives in a very moving speech and asked for forgiveness that both fathers granted him.Celine's mother said: “I am not capable of that today.»

Davos behind bars / / During the World Economic Forum (WEF), the free journey is severely restricted in Davos.Safety precautions slow traffic at a step pace.
If it requires the need for security, the high barriers are even built up in parallel to actual bulwarks - a inspection in the barricaded Davos.uhn.Davos, 18. Januarda's first large building that moves into view, you drive to Davos on the street from the Wolfgang Pass, is an apartment building, built with that lovelessness and profit greed of the boom, which has the second largest Graubünden place in the past four decadesThe architectural unort will let.
The windowless, three floors high facade has secured a mobile phone provider as a poster wall.From a bird's eye view, a green, barely populated landscape, in which a gigantic system from highways is lost on the distant horizon.Tough traffic duk The dream of the free trip has burst quickly.
500 meters after the healed world of total, unhindered networking, it continues at the step pace.During the season it is the rule that traffic through the streets in the center of the land water valley flees as tough as in any urban agglomeration of the Mittelland.But this Saturday there are many vehicles that do not want to fit into the picture of holidays and winter sports: police cars and army vehicles, minibuses and troop transporters, trucks and heavy pneul loaders who carry grille or barbed wire on their forks.
The security forces have obviously occupied Davos.In order to protect the World Economic Forum (WEF) and its top -class participants from all attacks, zones have been eliminated, which have now hermetically sealed off.In addition to the congress center and the immediately neighboring congress hotel, the large area, which spa park, ice stadium and the sports center take.
The sappers of the army have built non -ordinary abrasions as you know them from construction sites.Where the need for security is the largest, they are actual bulwarks.The fences that are over two meters high and, which are hardly to be overcome, were installed twice at a distance of a few meters in parallel.
Steel, box -shaped elements in the no man's land in between make the temporary construction immobilized.Iron chains are secured with heavy padlocks.Congress to the Pfefferland
The crown of the over 200 meters long wall, which separates the sports center from Talstrasse, is provided with barbed wire all over the length.Cantonal police officers are busy overrunning covers that mark the diversions that will be valid by the beginning of next week.At the checkpoint at the entrance to the security zone around the congress center, four police officers are doing their job in addition to a container.
Drivers who want to pass are stopped.If you get on foot, you can still pass undisturbed.The inner area also includes the two nobleest houses, the "Belvédère" and the "Seehof".
In addition, hundreds of bars around the village station and the “Flüela” hotel determine the picture.According to some chaots on Saturday this week, a rally should begin here, for which no application has been submitted and which will remain prohibited.Should sympathizers of the "Black Block" and "Revolutionary Alliances" actually venture to the Bahnhofsplatz and are not previously stopped, there will be no progress for them.
The McDonald's branch, whose windows broke three years ago, will also be behind massive barriers.The lady from the lowlands, who watches the soldiers, how they build a fence is still angry.She had to make big detours last year to get to her apartment and she wishes the congress to the Pfefferland.
A young man, who works in the hospitality industry, disagrees with her: the law enforcement officers have always been talking about.If you live in the locked zones or vacation, you can easily get in.
Davos remains the tourism center the martial impression that the security measures leave days before the WEF began, Davos is not in a state of emergency.The orders that the cantonal police have enacted record in the first place that all residents and guests, but also all persons who have a legitimate interest and can legitimize themselves, have the right to enter the security zones.If this were not guaranteed, Davos would have a real problem.
Because contrary to the popular opinion, the Landwassertal also remains the tourism center primarily during the forum week.Only around a quarter of the 24,000 foreign beds are occupied by congress participants, their entourage and their staff.And if you want to do the back of the whole hype, like quite a few locals, you want to turn your back on your back, there is a lot of space in the municipal area.
With an area of 254 km2, the landscape of Davos is larger than the canton of Zug - and without highways.Protests largely peaceful (sda) rallies against the WEF were largely peaceful in several cities on Saturday and without greater incidents.In Burgdorf (Bern) a police officer and a woman were slightly injured.
The demonstrator belonged to a group of 500 people who demonstrated one after the other under the motto "Zug about Zug Das WEF" in Freiburg, Bern, Burgdorf and Langenthal.The Bernese city and cantonal police, supported by additional officers from the police conference of Northwestern Switzerland, was on site everywhere with a large contingent.The tactics of the demonstrators to quickly move to different locations and split up had to use many police forces, the Bernese cantonal police wrote in a message on Sunday.

600 additional flight movements / / The World Economic Forum in Davos triggers high operation in Zurich Airport.Numerous state aircraft, business jets and helicopters are causing a sensation.
Behind the scenes, VIP supervisors and security forces have all their hands full.The World Economic Forum (WEF), which takes place in Davos from January 21 to 25, gives Zurich Airport an intensive time.Over 2100 participants from almost 100 countries are announced for this year's symposium.
A large number of “very important person” will arrive with your accompanying entourage in private jets or with government aircraft via Zurich Airport.The airport operator Unique is expecting around 600 additional flight movements in connection with the WEF.This number includes the helicopter transports between Zurich and Davos.
Whether helicopter flights are possible depends on the weather;In the past year, 119 departures or approaches were recorded.The start and landing windows (slots) for WEF traffic are assigned by the airport operator in consultation with the companies of the business aviation.
The line traffic must be taken into account, which is not to be affected by the movements of the private machines.The day -to -day business at the airport must be able to be handled normally.Depending on the weather conditions and the diplomatic status of the guests, it may be necessary to land or start a state aircraft during the blocking times, depending on the weather and the diplomatic status of the guests.
The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) issues the exceptional permits. Lack of parking spaces Last year, there were enough parking spaces for the private aircraft of WEF visitors at Dock E, which was not yet in operation at the time.With the use of all options, Unique can offer around 100 private machines a parking space this year.All available places are occupied on the top days.
Some WEF guests will only be able to land to change trains in Zurich.Your plane has to be parked at another airport in Switzerland or in nearby countries.Unique started planning for the WEF in November.
Spokeswoman Sonja Zöchling points out that changes often result in the last minute.This requires flexibility, not least by the group of Unique VIP supervisors, which is primarily concerned for the reception and the connection trip of the heads of state and government members.
The handling companies of the business air trip, Jet Aviation, Swissport Executive and Execujet also have to show mobility.The latter can offer special comfort with the Business Aviation Center.Execujet works with Swissport Executive Aviation for the handling of large aircraft types during the symposium.
The WEF offers the service providers in the top segment of aviation the opportunity to demonstrate the quality of their service packages.In addition to the provision of services around the aircraft and the organization of onward journey and accommodation, the offer takes into account all conceivable special requests.Discretion for security effort for security at Zurich Airport is responsible for the cantonal police.
Information chief Hans Baltensperger is limited to the expected brief statement that the police are well prepared.Means and efforts are not mentioned for tactical reasons.Unique and the handling of Agents, who only confirm that they have made “special precautions” in the interests of their customers.

AutoLeine / / As an antidote to the aircraft ratings, experts suggest that the on -board computers are easy to make certain flight routes and maneuvers (report on the right).This is also feasible for the car, as studies by the EU show.
Thanks to location technology, someone could prevent someone more than 50 km / h in town.Radar systems to prevent rear -end accidents should even automatically brake if the distance becomes too low.There are also systems that raise a central alarm (or prevent starting from the next stop) as soon as a vehicle leaves its permitted Rayon.

A motorway entrance at the airport blocked / / With a seat block at Zurich Airport, around 200 people hindered traffic on Wednesday afternoon.The protest against the World Economic Forum (WEF) was dissolved by the cantonal police after around an hour.
Around 200 people on Wednesday afternoon with a seat blockade immediately after the exit from the parking garages of the Zurich airport hindered traffic for over an hour.This should make it possible for the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to arrive to Davos.The street remained completely blocked for 30 minutes.
Members of the cantonal police dissolved the seat blocks by wearing, tugging or grinding the demonstrators individually from the street.Any water cannon was used as little as irritant gas.There were occasional abrasives on the demonstrators.
Two people were temporarily arrested.The “Mafalda Blockade Act” called for protest.According to his own information, he belongs to around 20 organizations, including the anti-WTO coordination, the group for a Switzerland without the army, the young Greens and the young socialists.
The meeting point for the participants in the protest was at 12:30 p.m. at Zurich Central Station.From there it went to the airport by public transport.At 1:35 p.m., the motorway entrance towards Zurich / St. Gallen and Schaffhausen / Bülach was blocked by the demonstrators ran onto the street.
They received shooting aid from the handlebars of a small van with Bern control signs and the inscription “Kulturbüro”, which stopped the vehicle and thus interrupted the flow of traffic.First, individual automobiles moved out to the Kantonsstrasse towards Rümlang / Glattbrugg via BP petrol station.The demonstrators were therefore asked by a leader to move the seat blocks by around 150 meters to the rear by a superstructure.
This temporarily blocked the traffic, which led to a backlog to the parking garages of the airport.The police began to carry the demonstrators individually from the street.At 2 p.m. 05, 30 minutes after the start of the campaign, the access to the cantonal road was released by the demonstrators.
Her resistance now focused on the driveway to the highway.When the people were carried away by the police, there were inevitably unsightly scenes.Some activists could be removed without resistance, others caused violent resistance, which in turn meant that the police had to apply violence.
In phases, the scenery also reminded of a game with a sisyphoid character.As soon as the demonstrators were worn over the guardrail on the side of the road, they partly lined up at the back of the seat block.This meant that individual demonstrators had to be carried away several times.
Personal controls were not carried out.Only two particularly renitated participants were temporarily arrested.At 2 p.m. 38, the police had decimated the blockade to such an extent that the driveway to the motorway could also be released for traffic.
High operation with the VIP service of the Zurichekk Airport.The blockade actions of opponents of globalization on the first day of the World Economic Forum (WEF) had been announced weeks ago.Emergency scenarios were developed at the airport, including the VIP service.
This receives state guests and members of royal homes after landing their aircraft in Zurich, drives them into the airport building with limousines and looks after them until they continue to Bündnerland in vehicle convoys or with helicopters.The emergency scenario of the VIP service was not implemented on Wednesday despite the temporary blockade of the motorway entrance.Short -term schedule changes
VIP service, which usually consists of 3 people and which is increased by 15 people during the WEF, is currently very busy.According to Ruedi Eicher, the head of service at Zurich Airport, the preparation for the most hectic time of the year begins in October.The employees of the VIP service are used in shift operation from 6 a.m. to midnight these days.
Sometimes your working day lasts longer, such as on Wednesday night, when former US President Bill Clinton arrived on the scheduled schedule with several hours.Short-term schedule changes mean that the program of the VIP service changes almost every hour.The normal passengers at Zurich Airport were also affected on Wednesday:
There was up to an hour and a half delay in the flight schedule.The situation was also tightened by poor visibility in the morning.- With about half an hour delay, a Lufthansa line machine landed in Kloten around 10 a.m. 45.
In addition to passengers who had nothing to do with the WEF, two government members from the USA and a Minister from Canada with their delegations were on board.Shortly before the anticipated arrival of the aircraft, a Hostess of the VIP service drove with a embassy representative in a bare-polished limousine to welcome the state guests in Zurich.With a blackboard on which the names of the expected WEF visitors stood and which she held up in front of her chest, the hostess was placed in front of the stairs, over which the passengers got out of the plane.
After shaking hands and exchanging kindness with the guests, she chauffeured the Canadian minister with his companion in the limousine into the airport building.The handling of top -class foreign guests is often very complex: many trips to a multi -member entourage that consists of armed security guards depending on the origin and status of the guest.
VIP reports on a shopping tourVIP service employee Lilian von Arx that most state guests and members of royal homes are modest people who maintained relaxed use.Every now and then it happens that the hostesses accompanied a visitor on a shopping tour in the airport to shorten the waiting time.An episode is particularly remembered:
The brother of the King of Jordan once undertaken an extensive shopping spree and mixed completely carefree among the other customers.While he obviously felt comfortable and amused, the companions responsible for his security had sweated blood.Further anti-WEF action.
In addition to the street blockade, there were other small interference and rallies from WEF opponents in various locations on Wednesday.At the airport, WEF's welcome desk was disturbed for a short time, and on the Hardbrücke in Zurich 5, a road was blocked with building material for a few minutes.In the afternoon, a demonstration train moved from Zurich Central Station to the Volkshaus;
In the early evening, around 200 activists at Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich 1 took part in a performance orchestrated by Radio Lora.Culinary height flights.The WEF also demands the employees of the flight catering group Gate Gourmet - especially when it comes to purchasing luxurious or exotic food.
Managing Director Beat Gehrig describes it as a challenge to get this within a short period of time.In addition to sushi, rare fruits and vintage wines, the crews of foreign aircraft also often wished special spices to pamper the guests traveling to WEF with dishes from home.It is not uncommon for the dishes to be prepared by their own chefs, tried by preliminary tasters and finally served on gold dishes.

Rest on the gold coast / / by Lukas Häß ·
A group of experts from the Zurich government provides suggestions for a new direction of air traffic.This is the result of research by the World Week.The pensioners in the south of Zurich Airport can soon pack up their flashlights with which they disturb the approaching pilots.
A group of experts called “Relief” used by the Zurich government checks a complete realignment of air traffic from and to Kloten.Instead of north to Germany and from the south to the communities of the Zurich “gold coast”, the jets should almost only fly from east to the Tösstal in the future.This resulted in research by the World week.
The West would then be the main focus direction.The government council and experts were not ready to answer questions about the “Relief” project.Until recently, hardly anyone expected this variant.
At first glance, it is captivating.Suddenly both the Germany and the southern approach problem would be solved.However, basic course is needed: a referendum for a new parallel slope for at least half a billion francs, a partial waiver on the protection of the flat bog between the slopes and, above all, the firm will, the resistance from Rümlang to Baden in the west and from Winterthur to Klotento offer the forehead in the east.
It still has to be clarified whether this new regime meets aviatic requirements.Because the direction of flight lies across the valley.The “Relief” team was launched in November 2002 by the Zurich construction director Dorothée Fierz (FDP).
In March, the approximately ten-member team with internationally renowned aviatics specialists and landscape planners will deliver their report to the building director.This creates an application that must be approved by the overall government council.A spokesman for the building directorate expects the “relief” results to be published until mid-2004.
It would take years before flight operations could be switched to East-West.The referendum, the construction of the slopes and the expected objections to the Federal Supreme Court would draw the project.Kühner litter The Dutch start of “relief” promised Ms. Fierz to sketch a flight operations within a year, which allows enough air traffic for the economy and at the same time burdened as few people as possible.
The work went into the length because originally a completely different idea in the heads of the experts.Using a parallel slope in a vertical direction, the traffic in the north of Zurich Kloten should have been concentrated - as was the case before resistance from southern Germany for decades.The east-west variant comes from the Dutch advisory company Netherland's Airport Consultants (Naco).
According to his own statement, Naco worked for around 500 airports worldwide.The Dutch amazed with a bold throw.With a new slopes, an eastern anfill over weakly populated area is quite possible.
And so they drew a train on their plans, which runs north of the freshly opened finger dock parallel to today's western slope 10/28.The former should only be landed, while the starts are largely concentrated on the western slope.The new flight regime would bother fewer people.
In the Winterthur area to Kloten east of the airport, around 89,000 people lived in 2000, in the zone from Rümlang to Baden there were 108,000.German state border 42,000 residents counted - together with the people in the Zurich city districts of Witikon and Schwamendingen, this makes it almost 300,000.It was the southern flights that made a broad protest movement from a local conflict last autumn.
The anger of those affected was increasingly directed against the mostly bourgeois political prominence living in their own towns, which is responsible for airport expansion and disputes with southern Germany.The president and the head of the airport company Unique live on the "Gold Coast", government council president Huber has his home in the Zurich Oberland, where the jets can also be heard.Other members of the government, bourgeois cantonal councilors and former airport managers such as the free Ulrich Bremi live in the south of the canton that is now noise.
The Dutch experts' proposal must sound tempting in the ears of these circles.With a new east-west runway and a corresponding change in the main traffic flow, the hated south trips would disappear forever.Finally, no more vigils at the airport, no hundreds of information events on compensation payments, no letter to the editor and leaflet.
The second big demo, planned for the next Saturday, against the southern flights with thousands of participants could be the last.Should the government council pursue this goal, it would have to declare the new east-west orientation as his own long-term goal and aim to implement its implementation.On the other hand, it would not be enough to insert them into the public discussion as an additional variant.
Despite partial privatization, the canton controls the airport and can drive its own ideas from the Bern supervisory authorities.This procedure would have extensive effects on the already initiated mediation process.The condition for a success of this compromise search is that all participants sit at a common table without a decision.
If, on the other hand, the redesign of the flight sky is already decided for the Zurich government, a broad attempt to mediate no longer makes any sense.Citizens of the first classegia are likely to speculate the “rebels of the south”.You will hardly have a compromise process in a compromise procedure if it has been proven to be proven that large flight operations are possible even without southern trips.
Your goal is not the fair distribution, but your own calm.The southern communities achieved an interim success in their fight against aircraft noise last November.Only because of the continuing protest from the traditional bourgeois college around Lake Zurich did the free economy director Ruedi Jeker had to hand in the airport endower.
His government colleagues commanded him to the police department and instead commissioned Rita Fuhrer with the SVP debt.Fuhrer has not yet burned his fingers at the airport as one of the few politicians.It is questionable whether the politician who has been spoiled by success will be more lucky than her predecessor.
It could succumb to temptation to unilaterally impose the east-west variant developed by the “relief” specialists.In this case, Fuhrer would speculate that the resistance in the Eastern Aviation lane and in the west waned over time.It could be a deceptive hope.
"Since the south has also ended up, we do not feel like the second class citizens for the first time," summarizes Peter Häberli from the Association of Aircraft noise solidarity in the east of the airport.Häberli does not want to leave the political power play of the gold coast communities unanswered.A survey is planned throughout Switzerland, not only in the canton.
There, the south is always advantageous because of its political prominence and the population.Peter Staub, the long -time President of the population of the population around Zurich Airport, also no longer wants to move away from a distribution of aviation in all directions.“If Zurich is to remain an intercontinental turntable, the entire slope system must also be usable.
So far it has always been the economic elite from the south, which demanded a large air traffic hub with as many long -distance connections as possible.Without this support, the airport couldn't have been so big.»Dust plans to limit air traffic to around 3,200,000 starts and landings per year.
"As much as in 2000, at the height of the boom." The residents in the north, east and west of the airport will fight for each new variant, including those of "relief", incorporate in the mediation process.In it you see your only chance.Since the aircraft noise had increased massively at the beginning of the Jet age in the early 1960s, they complained about the one-sided burden.
And since the beginning of this resistance, her protest has been unheard of against unchecked growth of air traffic.Only with the southern flights was the flight noise discussion extended to the entire canton.If the mediation fails because the south tries to perceive its interests elsewhere, the other communities around the airport would see themselves back into the minority.
You would run the risk of becoming the canton's “waste bucket” again.They felt resistance to the mediations “waste buckets” for decades.At that time, the bourgeois majority pursued a policy that was not shaped by trying to compensate between the different regions, but by unilateral support from Swissair.
The airline was able to make such drastic demands for those affected, practically always supported it by the government and the cantonal council in its pursuit of growth.So it happened that the Zurich politics did not critically take a close look at the risky expansion course of the airline, but put their fate in the hands of the withdrawn managers of the Balsberg.Until the crash.
Against this background, the long -time airport residents no longer want to know about unilateral orders on the part of the canton.They quickly supported the mediation process that is paid by the federal, canton and airport holder.Until spring, the intermediaries want to have clarified the conditions under which an attempted agreement could make sense.
Resistance to mediation is not only noticeable in the Zurich southern communities, but also beyond the national borders."We have our regulation now," says the Waldshut district administrator Bernhard Wütz as the strongest representative of southern Germany, "Why should we move away from it?»

High operation at the VIP service of the Zurich / / EKK Airport.The blockade actions of opponents of globalization on the first day of the World Economic Forum (WEF) had been announced weeks ago.Emergency scenarios were developed at the airport, including the VIP service.
This receives state guests and members of royal homes after landing their aircraft in Zurich, drives them into the airport building with limousines and looks after them until they continue to Bündnerland in vehicle convoys or with helicopters.The emergency scenario of the VIP service was not implemented on Wednesday despite the temporary blockade of the motorway entrance.Short -term schedule changes
VIP service, which usually consists of 3 people and which is increased by 15 people during the WEF, is currently very busy.According to Ruedi Eicher, the head of service at Zurich Airport, the preparation for the most hectic time of the year begins in October.The employees of the VIP service are used in shift operation from 6 a.m. to midnight these days.
Sometimes your working day lasts longer, such as on Wednesday night, when former US President Bill Clinton arrived on the scheduled schedule with several hours.Short-term schedule changes mean that the program of the VIP service changes almost every hour.The normal passengers at Zurich Airport were also affected on Wednesday:
There was up to an hour and a half delay in the flight schedule.The situation was also tightened by poor visibility in the morning.- With about half an hour delay, a Lufthansa line machine landed in Kloten around 10 a.m. 45.
In addition to passengers who had nothing to do with the WEF, two government members from the USA and a Minister from Canada with their delegations were on board.Shortly before the anticipated arrival of the aircraft, a Hostess of the VIP service drove with a embassy representative in a bare-polished limousine to welcome the state guests in Zurich.With a blackboard on which the names of the expected WEF visitors stood and which she held up in front of her chest, the hostess was placed in front of the stairs, over which the passengers got out of the plane.
After shaking hands and exchanging kindness with the guests, she chauffeured the Canadian minister with his companion in the limousine into the airport building.The handling of top -class foreign guests is often very complex: many trips to a multi -member entourage that consists of armed security guards depending on the origin and status of the guest.
VIP reports on a shopping tourVIP service employee Lilian von Arx that most state guests and members of royal homes are modest people who maintained relaxed use.Every now and then it happens that the hostesses accompanied a visitor on a shopping tour in the airport to shorten the waiting time.An episode is particularly remembered:

Swiss with business class on all European flights / / nz.The marketing concept launched at the end of August 2003, which had the conversion to the winter flight schedule on the European flights of the two smaller machines SAAB 2000 and Embraer 145 to the abolition of business class, is subjected to a change due to numerous customer complaints.The SWISS press office confirmed a corresponding report by the “Zürcher Unterländer” on request.
In February, the economy unity class is to be replaced by the proven two-class system on the 50 places offering small aircraft.Administrative Council President Pieter Bouw had previously confirmed (cf. NZZ on November 20, 03) that transfer passengers of the ridge or business class did not give it at all if they could only book Economy on Saab 2000 or on Embraer 145.As an annoyance, the Swiss undoubtedly only contributed to the introduction of the new marketing concept in European traffic in the EconomyClass on board catering and drinks only against payment and that the better paying customers were continuing to check in their preference treatment.

Siren sounds / / from Sepp Moser · The melody is known.
For more than half a year, we have heard good news about the state of negotiations in terms of company loan for the Swiss airline.Although the “urgently needed CHF 500 million” (Swiss boss André Dosé at the end of June 2003), 400 million needed - or not at all - have become less urgent.For this purpose, the major shareholders Swisscom and AMAG boss Walter Haefner - especially for the purpose of maintaining image, as is suspected in Swiss management - have in turn promised an additional tip in the scope of some percent of the originally drawn share capital.
But only in the event that all other major shareholders participate.However, most have waved off.Nevertheless, “in a very short time” (an employee of Swiss Finance Director Ulrik Svensson) should be understood.
The only stupid thing is that hardly anyone believes the siren sounds.In fact, the numbers speak a different language.The Swiss lost market shares in 2003;
Lufthansa alone has increased its by more than half to 11 percent, especially thanks to the increase in well -paying business travelers.The same applies to British Airways, Air France and KLM.The SWISS passenger numbers, which has increasing since autumn, are primarily due to price dumping.
Where the tariffs are high - for example on the former lucrative routes to Africa - the traffic breaks because the headless breakdown of the European network, which is highly profitable during Crossair times, collapses.Unpopular decision -making income is equally opposed to permanent to rising costs: A promised personnel loss in the squad - we were initially talking about 300 people, still of 100 - only partially took place, and no single was released by the ex -Swissair pilots,And entire departments are still moved from the cheap Basel to the expensive Zurich.
There is chaos everywhere.The earnings control that is so important for an airline (seat allocation to the individual tariff classes) has shrunk to less than a quarter of the former Swissair stand and completely overwhelmed.The consequences will soon be reflected in the financial figures of 2003.
For the first nine months, the loss of operations amounted to CHF 613 million, since then, according to conservative estimates, 100 to 150 million may have been added.Nobody would surprise a higher number, for example because because of the poor credit rating of the Swiss, the rent of the new Airbus long-haul aircraft alone is around $ 100,000 more expensive than budgeted.The liquidity, CHF 30, 2003 on September 30, 2003, has decreased further and is to reach a low of around CHF 150 million according to Dosé (in the company's internal information talks) before recovering.
Insiders from the Federal Office for Civil Aviation are of the opinion that this situation will require the withdrawal of the operating permit "if not today, then certainly in a very, very near future" due to the Aviation Act and its regulation.However, whether Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger will spend the courage for this unpopular decision is on another sheet.Will at least the strategic focus on the oneWORLD alliance of the battered Swiss will give some air in the future?
Unfortunately, one has to say more and more: hardly.There is no longer any mention of a “hub in Central Europe” (Swiss on September 23, 2003) from the former highly promised expansion of the junction system (HUB) in Zurich to a “hub in Central Europe”;At most, two or three African lies should still be "fed" by the alliance partners.
The intended merging of the Swiss computer systems with those of the British Airways proves to be considerably more expensive than planned, and the British have made it clear that these costs are to be borne by the Swiss.It is becoming increasingly clear that the Swiss has paid a very high price for its upcoming entry into the OneWorld alliance.The task of your own frequent flyer program is symptomatic for this.
For comparison, imagine that Coop would transfer its Supercard customer data to Migros' Cumulus program ... In the future, British Airways will decide which Swiss customers will be delighted with which marketing measures.The situation is serious and even a collapse is no longer unthinkable.
In all discretion, preparations for the spin -off of entire parts of the company, especially technology and computer science, should run.A employee familiar with the matter justifies the actions behind the scenes: "Then at least these areas do not fall into the bankruptcy mass." For the management and Board of Directors of the Swiss, none of these are alarm signs.They are still in good spirits.

Support for the group at a cheaper price / / with the aim of reducing operating expenses in favor of investments, the new logistics base of the army also has to include economic considerations in addition to military criteria in advance.With the dismantling of tools and the receipt of civil partnerships, funds are to be saved.
Lz.400 to 500 tons of army material are currently being liquidated per month.Last year it was around 5,600 tons.
These are corps material - around 6000 budget positions from the cooking box to genius and rescue equipment to the truck - which is no longer required in the new army due to the much smaller personnel stocks and the changed threats compared to the past.In eight “Army-Liq shops”, in which around CHF 10 million were implemented in 2003, bicycles and woolen blankets enjoy particularly high demand.Likewise, rain encouragement are always retired, but still ready to drive motor vehicles that are auctioned in Thun.
These activities are responsible for the newly created logistics base, which works with the planning staff of the army.The Armasuisse, the former group armor, is responsible for the sale of weapons systems such as tanks to foreign interested parties.These measures are intended to relieve tools and army motor parks by superfluous material and corresponding maintenance work and, last but not least, to reduce costs.
There are less close -knit armored stimulant networks of 31 so -called regular companies, cantonal and federal point of rooms as well as army motor vehicle parks, each of whom is connected to a maximum of one branch and which are responsible for an average of 20 warehouses.At least 600 army warehouses are still operated as a whole.This infrastructure, which was perfected during the Cold War, is to be reduced to a few “high-tech tool houses”, as the head of the army, Corps Commander Christophe Keckeis recently indicated.
Some armory has already been merged as part of the “Regionalization” restructuring project, such as the Seewen and Amsteg companies in Central Switzerland.A further slimming of the Swiss armory system is planned.Experience has shown that location questions contain a considerable regional and personnel policy explosiveness - not least in Germany - divisionist Werner Bläuenstein, who has been leading the logistics base with around 4,500 employees since the beginning of the year, does not yet come in detail.
However, if one assumes that only a substantial reduction in operating expenses can be gained more financial resources for investments, drastic interventions can be expected in the witness structure, which is largely based on federal points of view;This is all the more than the head of the logistics base, which is currently around CHF 800 million, in the future by up to 30 percent.Outputs that are no longer required are added to other uses.
For example, the Defense Department (VBS) only sold the facility in Zug a few days ago.In the future, the finally remaining witness network should become more powerful as it is cheaper than modern information technology for warehouse management and the control of logistical processes.In this regard, the logistics base compared to civilian companies with comparable tasks is still behind.
It is obvious that positions can also be saved.In addition to military criteria, care according to the bringing prince, the formation of the logistics base primarily made economic considerations, as was also the case in Germany when organizing the dispute base, which in some parts can be understood as a model for the Swiss model.In its “starting line -up”, the logistics base is so that it can satisfy the logistical needs of the group, but at the same time can also perform cross -sectional tasks from the actual administrative area of the army such as finance and translation services.
Innovations arise in advance by the fact that in the new army the supply should no longer be carried out on basic care places, but according to the bringing principle.This means that the troop commander apply for when and where they want to have provided the required material.And the logistics base ensures the transports, among other things with the logistics brigade 1. This large association is subordinate to 20 battalions, a number that actually contradicts every management theory.
However, since the implementation of the logistics basis is understood as a development project, as a ongoing process, corresponding organizational adjustments cannot be ruled out.Civil partnerships should also be the case in other areas.The former Federal Office of the Army has been transferred to the logistics base under the name logistics base.
The Federal Office of the Air Force remains in the traditional area.Already in the phase of the conceptual preliminary clarifications for the logistics basis, the problem of proper organizational assignment of this area was reason for sometimes violent arguments.As a former air force officer, Bläuenstein is familiar with the topic.
He believes that the Air Force, the so-called flight line, must continue to remain the responsibility of the Air Force Commandant.The building maintenance or the maintenance of training systems, for example, could be taken over by the logistics basis.New structures and savings should never be an end in itself;
The needs of the army are still at the center.Such and other problem groups are now being processed in individual projects in the so-called business areas, for which corresponding line and staff organs are available.Among other things, it should also be clarified to what extent under the keyword “Outsourcing” could be taken over by the troop or the work done by the military administration cheaper.
The focus is on questions about the future management of the vehicle fleets or after troop catering under the largely inpatient conditions in barracks and on set up training positions.As Bläuenstein thinks, you have to get to work very carefully.In the Bundeswehr, too, expectations of saving money with the outsourcing of originally military activities would not have been met everywhere.
In addition, the crisis resistance of companies that want to take on such orders should be charged during outsourcing.The army thinks in periods of thirty years.In view of the rapid changes in the economic sector, forecasts about the long -term stand assets of partners from the private sector were therefore not easy.
Under the keyword "economy" it is checked whether the army pharmacy can in future work according to the principles of leadership through performance mandate and global budget.It remains to be seen whether a private -sector solution should even be sought in this area.The orientation of army logistics on the principles of business and financial management demands increased employees who are saddle festival in these divisions and have solid military knowledge.

Mediation instead of aviation policy?/ / The question of how the noise dispute around Zurich Airport can be settled, not only affects the airport residents.
The importance of aviation for the Swiss export country and the need for a prospective aviation policy were at the center of the General Assembly of the Zurich Interest Group.Preparations for a mediation process for the future operating regulations of the Zurich Airport have started.The four -member team of experts, which was commissioned by the Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (UVEK) to prepare the process, will make a recommendation until in April whether and under what conditions the mediation can be recorded.
Possible participants include authorities in Switzerland and Germany, aviation, environmental associations, political parties, business associations and civil organizations.Those who participate in the procedure will only be determined at the beginning of the mediation.What type of airport should be negotiated?
The question was asked at the 13th General Assembly of the Zurich Airport (IGFZ) interest group by the President, Alt Cantonal Councilor Georg Schellenberg (Zell).So far, the federal government has not defined what airports he wish for export and inland Switzerland in the interests of the entire country.Clearly formulated goals should be available if you strive for mediation with so many partners that all have opposing interests.
The IGFZ is in contact with the preparation team for any participation in mediation.- Guest speaker Paul Kurrus, President of the Aerosuisse, Vice Director of the Swiss and up to the federal elections from last October National Council (FDP., Basel-Landschaft), highlighted the reasons for his postulate, which he submitted in autumn 2001.It requires a broad -based aviation policy of the federal government.
Political will formation is necessary because the aviation makes the public to a large extent (both in terms of benefit and the loads), the aviation is part of public transport, the state played an important role in the compensation for interests, investors needed long -term, reliable framework conditions andAviation should not be exposed to the political preferences of the changing members of the state government and the incumbent transport minister.More than local Aviation air traffic is a nationwide location question, explained Kurrus.The Federal Council's report is necessary in order to make the overall economic importance of aviation for Switzerland.
The not uncommon in Bern that the aircraft noise in Zurich is a local matter, as well as subliminal malice about the problems of the Zurich problems, disregarded the interests of the internal country, which needs a well -functioning transport connection via the air.- The report of the Federal Council on the postulate Kurrus, which was originally expected at the end of the last legislature, but was postponed to Swiss air traffic due to the security examinations in the Leuenberger department, is now to be presented to Parliament this year.Decline in the membership at the Igfzdie
IGFZ counted 1806 members as of January 1 of this year, around 7 percent companies.The inventory was still in 1941 in the previous year. Part of the withdrawals took place because the people in question lost their position at the airport or at the relevant company.

With Blocher and Merz, Swiss has a good stand / / Bern.Surprisingly positive signals from the new Federal Council for the Swiss:
The airline is making progress.And even the topic of capital increases is obviously no longer a taboo.New tones from the head of the Swiss committee, by Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger (57) at the last Federal Council meeting to the Dossier Swiss.
"The Federal Council has found that Swiss has made significant progress," confirms government spokesman Achille Casanova to Blick.New Federal Councilor Hans-Rudolf Merz (61) also includes the three-member committee.However, the motto still applies: "The Swiss has to become competitive on its own and assert itself in the competition." The two new, Hans-Rudolf Merz (61) and Christoph Blocher (63,) were amazingly open according to Blick information:

Fighting jets away and yet more noise / / The fighter jets in Dübendorf could disappear at the end of the year, which would give more space for Kloten.And Germany refuses mediation.
A damper for southern approach opponents.From Erwin Haas for the population around Zurich Airport, the aircraft noise will look bleak.On their impression that they are ripped off by the political decision -makers in favor of the air traffic lobby and robbed of their democratic rights by emergency law, another message from yesterday Friday fits.
The "Glattaler" wrote that the army was considering the savings idea to stop the Jet operation at the Dübendorf military airfield at the end of 2004.5000 starts and landings of fighter jets per year would be omitted.Exactly towards February 2005, if the laying of two German waiting rooms over Swiss area is due, this could create a lot of air for traffic flying and new flight paths in the south of the airport - to the dismay of the already plagued population.
Skyguide makes no secret of the fact that the new waiting rooms above the Fricktal and the Thurgau Lake Constance have moved south a shift of the entire German -Swiss airspace.More scope for action would be passed.Unique is still covered by the submitted operating regulations.
It is currently being examined by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) and is to be presented to the public in mid -February.It has already become known that the airport at Starts south is a larger left-hand bend than today to avoid the intersection of arrival and departure traffic in the event of a start.The curve should no longer lead over Valaisellen and the Hardwald, but over Schwamendingen and Dübendorf.
Unique also requires more direct deployment routes to the east and flexible use of the slopes between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.Mediation not a matter of Germany's second bad news:
There is nothing more to discuss for Germany.The locks for approaches to Kloten are enforced, Basta.Anyone who believed that German aircraft noise and politicians might get more tolerance in the top -up air fermentation mediation.
The Waldshut district administrator Bernhard Wütz said in the district council that the mediation proceedings would not take part in representatives of the Federal Government, the State of Baden-Württemberg nor the southern German Bundestag and state parliamentarians or citizens' initiatives.Mediation is regarded as an interior Swiss process in Berlin and is not a matter of Germany, Wütz was quoted in the “Südkurier”.The rural districts of Waldshut, Black Forest Baar and Constance only want to choose after their preliminary talks with the preparatory of mediation Wolfgang Wörnhard.
But all evidence indicates that Germany cannot be softened.So far, no loosening of the German requirements has been obtained on the right: Unique, Swiss and the federal government have been flashed with their complaints from German and European legal instances.Both unique and politicians say again and again.
But that is exactly what has happened to the trouble of the noise -plagued residents for years.They carry the consequences of German north approaching in the night border hours, which have also made southern trips necessary since 2001 and since October.Unique has summed up in its latest residents' newspaper "The Full Truth":
"As long as Germany blocks its airspace for approaches from the north and there is no real alternative (for example, the cranked northern approach), additional east and southern flights are necessary." Germany wants to fear the number of sink airport critics.The provisional prevailing provisional could be fixed for years in the “preliminary operating regulations”, which Unique submitted to the Bazl at the end of the year, due to the lack of a suitable alternative for years.It will be worse this year:
From April, the new instrument landing system allows southern flights from April to a far worse point of view and deeper low -cloud border than the previously practiced approach procedure.Germany will issue fewer exceptional permits for northern flights and expects to reduce 110,000 per year to less than 80,000 today.The turmoil is programmed.
While many affected people hardly give any opportunities, the realization is becoming increasingly popular that only a limitation of the starts and landings can remedy the situation.The representatives of the cantonal and city government have so far been difficult to do in the Unique Board of Directors.They do not want southern trips, but also no bonds for the airport.

Ways to the WEF special number / / met.Davos, January 23 after the Schwab's tie spell (NZZ 23. 04), the outfit at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos is less than ever a distinction between VIPS and non-vips.The catering employee, the President, the chauffeur, they all come around the same.
And yet there is a way to stand out from the crowd: when choosing the means of transport for the arrival, the chaff differs significantly from the wheat.The least noticeable drives who travels the path from Zurich Airport to the conference venue by train.
For 168 francs - the tariff kilometers on the Rhaetian track are particularly short due to the difficult topography - the 1st class return ticket is to be had.According to Jean -Loup Dénéréaz, director of events and general services of the WEF, there are thousands of the total of 7000 to 8000 in terms of global economic forum to the Landwassertal travelers who choose the rail - also out of enthusiasm for the widely known lines of the meter track.About the same high to book, the Bus service Zurich Airport-Davos organized by a subcontractor of the WEF strikes and back.
Without the buses - Dénéréaz expects up to 5000 passengers - and the VW vans, who also contest local traffic in Davos on a roundabout route, does not work here.The chauffeur is included for a small surcharge according to
The brochure, which has been sent to all WEF participants, included a limousine service, chauffeur.Already for CHF 2070 for the long version of the Audi 8 Quattro you are on the Zurich-Davos return route.
The black and gray Audi, 80 in number and freshly washed every morning, cannot be overlooked in the Davos street.Nor do their drivers.They are almost the only ones who, contrary to the WEF "regulation", with a tied tie.
For the limousines, the otherwise strict Davos Park regime does not seem to apply, because they stand all overall, not to the delight of the chauffeurs of the Davos line buses that have already come into a traffic jam.The air path remains.There are slightly higher expenses here.
Make around 50 to 60 WEF participants, again according to the brochure mentioned, use the offer of a private helicopter company.For the return flight to the specially built helicopter terminal in Davos Dorf, CHF 4,300 (one-engine, flight time 48 minutes) or CHF 9600 (two engines, 36 minutes).There are currently other air traffic in the Davos landscape - apart from the patrolling and barely noticeable F / A -18.
The Confederation is responsible for the transport of the particularly highly positioned personalities in accordance with international law.Here the Air Force is challenged with its helicopter fleet.It ends up in specially secured locations.
But because all of this is “Strictly Confidential”, we do not get any further here despite relevant own observations.After all, it is about the safety of people who are as endangered as Pakistan's President Musharraf.Incidentally, the Americans trust their own flight material and their own pilots, which are instructed by the Swiss Air Force into the special features of the high mountain flight.
Snow chains are mandatory in line with those who have traveled with our own car, like us.The Graubünden police faced a special problem on the opening day when the route through the Prättigau from Küblis was only open to vehicles with snow chains because of the strong snowfall.The law enforcement officers had a sharp eye in order to prevent blocking of the road on trucks with insufficient winter equipment.
As for us: we decided on the restriction-free route "around at the back", via Thusis-deep castel-Alvaneu-Wiesen.Firstly, we have no snow chains, and secondly we were shyed away by - we have which - their assembly.This is a late sequence from the early days of military duty, when chicane still belonged to the repertoire of educational measures.

The transponder, the mysterious thing / / automatic wireless data exchange takes place more and more - thanks to the transponder.Walter Jäggransponder is an artificial word from the terms transmitter (transmitter) and responder (answerer), which means a device that automatically sends certain data on request.
Transponders have been used in aviation for a long time, they send information about the identity of the aircraft, the aircraft type, the flight altitude and other things to the radar station, because the radar cannot collect such data itself.Radar transponders are active devices with their own power supply.But there are also passive transponders who send out your data without becoming active as an echo.
These include the theft fuses that are installed in many products: A transmitter at the shop output can activate the transponder, a receiver absorbs the echo and determines whether the article is paid or not.Passive transponders do not need a battery, they are relatively cheap, but can still save and even process quite a lot of data (if a chip is built in).You are currently experiencing a real boom in very different areas of application.
For example, the Paris transport companies switch their subscription to touch-free chip cards, the identification chip for pets has been mandatory by the EU limit organs, ski lifts, snack machines and front doors are used with bathrooms that contain a transponder.RFID is located in the trend dank and cheaper production of the electronic components, the transponder will soon find further distribution.Under the name RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), this radio technology is used for shortest distances (a few centimeters to meters), for example, when it is identified.
The prices label contains the radio chip and antenna.This allows the path of a product to be followed very well from the factory to the cash register.Automatic cash register systems that the customer can serve in the supermarket himself are also intended.
It is even discussed whether euro banknotes should contain a transponder as an additional security feature once.The data protection officers are already frowning.PICTURE
Fraunhofer society -flexible chips make passive radio technology handy.The end of the line code? In 1968, the first line code system was developed in the United States.
There are now several systems all over the world - and hardly any etiquette or packaging without.Common to all of these codes is that they are visually read.Numbers and letters are shown graphically.
A one -dimensional code (line code) is the code for European article numbering (EAN), two -dimensional is a matrix code, three -dimensional codes also contain color information.Optical codes are to be attached very cheap and can still be read automatically.Disadvantages: There must be a visual connection between scanner and data carrier (not necessary for RFID), and the amount of data that a code can contain is very limited (more data can be made with RFID, they can also be supplemented).

Marc Gerson missed the aircraft / / shock for the Könizer volleyball players at Kloten Airport: Marc Gerson was not left in the Swiss machine to Belgrade.The team boss of Zeiler Köniz had no valid pass.
· Thomas Wälti, Belgradbis to the tax collector at the finger dock everything goes well.Marc Gerson quickly passes all checkpoints.He already sees the nose of the Swiss machine, which is supposed to bring him to Belgrade by flight LX 1416.
But he fails at the last hurdle.The customs officer does not let the trainer from Zeiler Köniz through.Marc Gerson took the old Luxemburger Pass, which had expired on March 9, 2002.
The valid is at home.The hurried fax with the proof that Marc Gerson actually has a valid passport is just as much impressive as the fact that the Serbian Montenegrin Consularin in Bern gave the green light for Gerson's entry to Belgrade.The Swiss, if you hear, did not want to take the risk of a possible $ 5000 buses that could have been available at inconsistencies at Belgrader Airport.
Vlckova's battle tendency lifting degree sinks into the plot.Traffic chaos, minus temperatures and the Gerson-Mania on Natel: Preparations for the third game as part of the Champions League from today Wednesday against Red Star Belgrade (from 17.55 live on Telebärn) are under a bad star."I have never experienced anything like this," says Captain Zdenka Vlckova, "that messes up the usual processes.»
She may not come up with how reacted if a player had forgotten her passport at home.According to Vlckova, it is important not to get nervous."We have to appear as relaxed as against Novara and fight, fight, fight, fight." Two times "Top of Europe" Vlckova is currently the most successful attacker with 33 teams of winning.
The 31-year-old Czech with 9 blocks also comes first in block statistics."Of course that's great," says Vlckova, "in contrast to other players, I have already played twice.»When accepting the ball, on the other hand, the Könizer fault is relativized:
As the best Swiss woman, Sarah Rohrer only appears in the 20th place.This clearly shows where Zeiler has deficits compared to the top European clubs.If Vlckova continues to play constant at her high level, she should also be an issue for foreign clubs.
Would she irritate an offer from the Italian series A1?"You can always listen," says the 1.81 m tall middle attacker, "that doesn't cost anything.But I think I stay with Zeiler.
The good environment in Köniz is important for me, you can't weigh it with money. »Zdenka Vlckova should continue to delay her baby request and also play for Zeiler Köniz in the 2004/05 season."This summer I want to acquire the trade diploma," says Vlckova, "after that I want to complete the commercial training." In the meantime, epilogeneous of the meantime Marc Gerson has not remained idle.
He got his valid pass at home and arrived in Belgrade with a flight yu 331 last night.The scattered Zampano not only missed Zeiler training, but also 3-0 success (25:16, 25:14 and 25:18) from Novara against Roter Star.· Archive picture BlatterMarc

Unique and Swiss can move their complaint in Germany against the restrictions at Zurich Airport.The Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig already approved the revision on January 7, as was announced yesterday Tuesday.The Baden-Württemberg Administrative Court in Mannheim dismissed the lawsuit on January 24, 2003 and was not approved by any revision.
He had rejected all the reasons for the lawsuit.Among other things, Unique and Swiss had argued that the night flight bans and weekend restrictions on the German side violated their rights.The Zurich airport operators and Swiss were satisfied with the Leipzig decision on request.
Nevertheless, it has not yet been said that the lawsuit would be moved on, said unique spokesman Jörn Wagenbach.This requires an in -depth examination.The matter is certainly being pursued, however, SWISS spokesman Dominik Werner said.
Cover Lex Koller.Ap.The Legal Commission of the Council of States wants to abolish the restrictions for foreigners as soon as possible when buying land in Switzerland.
As a condition for this step, however, she named a preliminary examination of various measures in the area of spatial planning on Tuesday to prevent abuse and undesirable developments in building holiday and second apartments.However, since such an examination will take a lot of time, the Commission first wants to make the loosening proposed by the Federal Council.No buses for heirs.
Ap.Heirs should not be burdened for their testator's tax buses.The Legal Commission of the Council of States has unanimously voted for the abolition of the heir liability for tax buses.
As you announced on Tuesday, Swiss law should be adapted to the European Convention on Human Rights.The European Court of Human Rights decided twice against Switzerland in terms of heir buses.As a reason, he stated that such buses were purely personal and could therefore not be inherited.
Criticism of police operations.Ap.Switzerland has been asked to make great efforts in its fight against racism.
A European Council commission praised progress, but criticized the treatment of blacks by the police and the public.In its third country report, the European Commission criticizes against racism and intolerance (ECRI) above all police attacks against people of African origin."Blacks are obviously only stopped by the police in Switzerland because of the police and have to endure insults and abuse," writes the Commission.
The Federal Department of the Interior sees itself confirmed by the report in its efforts, but defends itself against the general criticism of the police.This is aware that there can be a few miserably.The federal commission against racism called on politics and the economy to perceive the issues themed and to organize their actions afterwards.
Drive without ID.Sda.Even after withdrawing the driver's ID card, automotiveists can continue to use a car - however, it must not drive faster than 45 km / h.
However, this legislative gap is rarely exploited.Article 34 of the revised traffic approval regulations (VZV) stipulates that withdrawal "for all categories and subcategories" of the driver's card applies.Cars with a top speed of 45 km / h do not include one of the driver's ID categories or subcategories.

Agno: New rules remain in force / / lausanne / Lugano.- The new incoming regulations for the Lugano Airport in Agno, which have been valid since November 1, remain in force.
In a judgment of January 23, the Federal Supreme Court definitely spoke out against the suspensive effect.It supported the decision of the recursions of the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication from October 28.As early as mid -November, the Federal Supreme Court had provisionally spoken out against an application from the canton of Ticino and the city of Lugano for suspensive effect.
However, the decision of the Federal Court has no consequences.Because the Federal Office for Civil Aviation approved the airlines Swiss and Jet Aviation in December a new approach procedure with a less steep approach angle.As a result, machines of the Saab 2000 or Citation in Agno can easily land again.

Scrap flyer in the sights / / EU is deciding on new requirements for the control of air traffic.Defects should also be made known to the public.
Brussels.Mt.For years, the EU Parliament, Commission and Member States fought over a new guideline for the safety of aircraft from third countries.
After the crash of a machine of the Äyptian “Flash Airlines”, which had been objected to in Switzerland, things suddenly went quickly.The mediation committee of Parliament and Council of Ministers agreed on Tuesday night on new security regulations.According to this, there will be standardized requirements for inspections in the future.
The Commission will provide a report on the inspections once a year to the public.If a country impose a landing or overflow ban on an airplane, the Commission can pull the plane out of circulation for all of the European area.In the opinion of EU Transport Commissioner Ana Loyola de Palacio, the airplane accident at the Red Sea, in which 148 passengers lost their lives, could have been avoided:
"This is a shame" she commented on the delays at the directive proposed by the Commission as early as 1997.The dispute between Spain and Great Britain about the status of the Gibraltar Airport is said to have hindered the agreement so far.Gibraltar is accused of treating safety regulations both in the sea and air traffic.
Nevertheless, according to the EU, the security standards in third countries are much lower than with its members.The accident rate per million flights is 0.11 for Western European airlines and 2.68 in Russia.Airlines from Africa, Asia and South America have twice as high as the accident as the average worldwide.Because of the bilateral air traffic agreement, Switzerland will have to take over the new EU regulations that still have to be approved by the Council of Ministers and Parliament.
Basically, a Europe -wide solution is welcomed, said the spokesman for the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl), Daniel Göring.However, the European Aviation Conference in Paris (CEAC), which also includes Switzerland, has already conducted a database about random inspections.For example, Switzerland has registered its defects in Geneva on the “Flash Airlines” machine of the CEAC.
At the next conference of the CEAC, Switzerland wants to clarify whether the problem of dangerous aircraft cannot be tackled faster and in a larger frame.If the EU actually wants to publish a list of the objectioned airlines, data protection problems arise for Switzerland.After the “Flash Airlines” accident, the Bazl currently only provides the expressly justified, i.e. passengers who have booked a flight with a suspicious society.

Easier with a hotel plan / / doe.Hotelplan is careful and combative at the same time the 2004 summer season.
You do not expand the range of destinations, but offer new, especially cheaper variants in terms of price and for the means of transport.In particular, Belair Croatia and Sardinia are flown with their own society, which were previously offered via Autoplan.Since flying has become cheaper, these and other Belair charter flight destinations appear attractive, especially if the more comfortable C/relax class is included.
Early book discounts between CHF 50 and CHF 200 per person and the upgrading used with 100 francs to the relaxed class for early bookers can change a family holiday budget and the feeling of travel-provided that it is booked until April 4.Swiss number two now offers a building block in the North America puzzle with a Belair flight non-stop to Las Vegas;From there, for example, the car continues individually to the national parks and to San Francisco, where (at the same flight ticket price as Las Vegas Retour) can be started.
In contrast to Kuoni, in contrast to Kuoni, the discounts emphasized the discounts thanks to cheaper flying or the "Hit three nights at the price of two".The price war is also expressed in the new “Easy simple holiday” catalog for numerous destinations.Because it is cheaper, the customers can and should book more easily - the appeal to Easy Jet is unmistakable.

"Communist" against low -cost airlines / / The crisis of the flight industry has so far spared cheap pilots like Ryanair.Now headwind from Brussels threatens.
By Marcel Speiserum Great Words, Michael O'Leary was never embarrassed.Recently, the head of the Irish low -cost airline Ryanair has repeated his business mantra in front of investors and customers not to offer cheap flights in the future, but free flights.Now the sheet has turned, and the same O'Leary says that it is simply "inevitable" that ticket prices will rise in Europe.
What happened ?Wednesday was between the opposite statements.On this day, stock exchange favorite Ryanair lost over 30 percent of value (TA from yesterday);
The equivalent of CHF 2.4 billion has dissolved into air after the first winning warning in the company's history.As a result, O'Leary has even become poorer by around CHF 130 million.But that's not the reason why he mutated from the cheap pope to the prophet more expensive tickets.
Was Ryanair illegally subsidized?Rather, the cause of O'Leary's transformation is very close to Ryanair's base in Charleroi, Belgium, in Brussels.The EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio works there.
Next Tuesday, she could make sure that the Irish airline's share price will get under the bikes even more than in the middle of this week.Specifically, the EU Commission is expected to publish its decision on Tuesday whether it wants to act against Ryanair because of the assumption of unauthorized state aid.Before the airline selected Charleroi state airport as a hub, it made tax relief, deeper landing and handling fees as well as other subsidies.
Out of interest in luring traffic to Charleroi, the Walloon government agreed to the demands and even paid the airline to the accommodation for the employees.If the EU Commission qualifies these deals as illegal subsidies, Ryanair threatens repayment claims of several million euros.That alone would still be manageable for Ryanair, as around 1.7 billion francs were on liquid funds in O'Learys cash register at the end of 2003.
The basis of the Wackeltschwerer business model weighs another possible consequence of the EU decision.Commissioner de Palacio, recently disrupted by O'Leary because of her Charleroi intervention as a "communist", could ban the benefits that Ryanair received from the Belgian state has received.This would be fundamentally questioned the business model of the cheap airline.
More than any other European Lowcost carrier, the Irish rely on remote and cheap airports, which they motivate them with the view of a passenger boom (1000 passengers = 1 workplace) for further concessions.With this strategy, Ryanair has become one of the largest airlines in Europe within a few years.If this procedure will be denied in the future, she must either accept shrinking profit margins or increase prices.
O'Leary doesn't taste either.With more expensive tickets, he would simply lose passengers in view of the steadily increasing competition among airlines.And his profit margin has already fallen dramatically - from 23.2 percent in the third quarter of 2002 (at the end of December) to currently 16.1 percent.
Finally, the utilization digits also fall.O'Leary therefore indirectly admitted that Ryanair had grown faster than it would have been healthy due to the market development.No wonder, de Palacios does not even get the upcoming decision.
No wonder that he defamates her intervention as a "communist" and - pointed - a "disaster for the entire Lowcost industry".Because he knows very well: Ryanair pursues the most aggressive and consistent cheap strategy among the airlines and is therefore the most vulner.

The difficult profession of aircraft seller / / in times when thousands of transport aircraft stand around on the ground unused is not enviable.Even if the need for new patterns should grow by shut down old aircraft, airlines are still difficult for new investments against the end of the most severe aviation.
It is all the more than waiting for relatively new aircraft at the used market at cheapest prices.Nevertheless: «Basically, the sale of commercial aircraft is a simple market.After all, there are only two producers left - Boeing and Airbus, »explains Christian Scherer, Airbus Senior Vice President for transactions and control systems.
Scherer, who also holds the position as deputy head of commercial, speaks of a total of around 300 airline customers worldwide, who determine the tendency for the need for 100 to 500-sided jets.It can be assumed that everyone knows everyone - and of course also talking to the competitor.«And that makes aircraft sales a very brutal business, a frontal confrontation with the only competitor.»
Scherer believes that it is easier for Airbus to sell planes than for Boeing.The statement should probably be inspired by sales success on the last Paris Air Show and the enjoyable order receipt for the A380.Long path to the conclusion of the contract, which starts from a planned aircraft order is very high.
Finally, the purchase of an aircraft has a massive impact on finances.The basis for a business initiation is the connection between customer and the seller.Airbus employs around 70 aircraft sellers, which are distributed on 8 so -called “business units”, ie regions such as Asia, Europe, Africa and so on.
If the purchase interest is located, Airbus marketing specialists appear.These calculate the individual needs of an airline for the respective aircraft type.Other specialists take care of transactions and financing.
From the first contact, it can take years for a contract to be concluded - or not.Every order is difficult.Some special.
Somewhat sad, Scherer looks at those countries who are denied by embargos to buy aircraft that they urgently need.Politics influences sales activity.Markets such as Libya, Iran or Syria are idle.
"To penetrate into these important markets will only succeed if our hands are free," explains Scherer.Which means that sanctions have to be officially canceled.For example, the Iranian societies Iran Air and Mahan Air are extremely interested in buying Airbus aircraft in order to offset old fleet parts.
However, Scherer fears that the United States will only give up an embargo if you receive orders for your own industry in return.In the short term alone, there is a need of at least 50 aircraft in these embargolands, which ranges from the A319 to the A380 for routes such as Tehran-London.The need is so great that solutions would have to be found.
The perspective of major orders of individual alliances provides special problems.It looks good on paper when some members of the Star Alliance, including the AUA group or Lufthansa, want to buy 100 aircraft.«But then the individual wishes of each individual airline come out very quickly.
And then such a mass sale becomes more complex and complex, »Christian Scherer points out.Such major orders should remain exceptions in the foreseeable future.Customer wishes for the current range of the A340 - 500 out of 16 450 kilometers are airlines new options in the area of the ultra -long route.
From this year Singapore Airlines will fly non -stop from Los Angeles to Singapore in 18 hours.But that's not enough for some customers.Sir Richard, boss and founder of the British Virgin Atlantic, asked John Leahy, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, because of a larger surgical distance.
"Due to the possible increase in the range of the A340 - 500, non -staunch lies could also be possible for up to 20 hours long from 2005," explains Leahy.This would be the first time Australia from Europe from Nonstop, in this case on the London Sydney route, with maximum passenger utilization.Regardless of this, Leahy is convinced of the success of the Super Airbus A380.
Well over 100 units of the largest transport aircraft have already been ordered.Leahy estimates the need for airplanes of this size in the next 20 years to between 1400 and 1500 copies."How much of it we will sell depends on whether Boeing also gets involved with this size area." Kurt Hofmann

Moroccan MPs held at the US airport / / Portland, February 2.(AP)
Seven Moroccan parliamentary deputies with diplomatic passes have been held for several hours due to a number of misunderstandings at Portland, Oregon Airport.The parliamentarians, who were on an information trip in the USA and did not speak English, were searched and questioned by officials from the Federal Police FBI.One of the seven got a coffee on Saturday morning before climbing the aircraft and left his hand luggage in the waiting zone, the other MPs already went on board.
The authorities were then reported an abandoned piece of luggage.Its owner was therefore not left on board, whereas his colleagues protested at the aircraft crew.This did not understand what it was about because of language problems, and the pilot showed the six off board.
The Moroccans were finally released, but missed a connecting flight before they could continue traveling on Saturday evening.They expressed understanding of increased security measures, but described their treatment as unacceptable.A spokesman for the traffic safety authority described the circumstances of the incident as "very unhappy".

The secret thing “Starfighter” / / Dangerous can no longer be.What was supposed to happen to the Starfighter, which was almost blowing from his base on the Grenchner flight in the harness in December, is still top secret.
· Johannes Hofstetterfall would at some point award a prize for the wordkarest press spokeswoman if Valérie Burgat from Grenchner Breitling AG would be a hot candidate for one of the first places: With the words "It is nothing clear", she answers an entire questionnaire thatActually only about a long -since -aer plane.
Specifically: around the Starfighter, who had been "guarded" the Grenchner Airport Greisel for years, almost blew off the wind in December, removed from the police and the fire brigade, stored in a nearby meadow, promptly sailed and finally in a hangar of Farner Air Servicewas evacuated at the airfield.The rumors hunt with the plane in the meantime has been unclear.It is rumored to have already been cleaned and repainted.
Rumor has it will soon be placed on his traditional place on the roundabout.In rumors, however, the insurance experts still do not agree on who - if at all - should arise for the damage that is still unpaid.Rumored to the airplane, nobody seems to be responsible.
But just: At Breitling AG, the owner of the prominent bird, the future of the jet is declared as a secret matter.The five -ton Grenchner landmark is shielded by the public.The request to be able to photograph the plane in the assembly hall was friendly, but definitely rejected by Valérie Burgat yesterday.
And the question of when the "widow maker" (see box) will be let back outside was just as unanswered as all other questions.The little consolation: you can call Burgat, yes "in two or three weeks".Until then, the jet will "certainly not happen," she says.
But who knows: Perhaps the formerly internal and now parked pilot affects superordinate national interests in neutral Switzerland.With which Grenchen - as Mayor Boris Banga has long wanted - would finally be known throughout Switzerland.At least the secret would make a certain sense.
· Picture Isabel Mäder -confused picture: When - and whether - the Starfighter will decorate the Grenchner Airport Greire again, is unclear.
Breitling AG as the owner of the jet is silent.The Lockheed F-104 star fighter, developed in the 1950s, was referred to.The name therefore moved that the plane had a small wing area;
The span was seven meters with a rumbling length of 17 meters.The designers of the aircraft had only one goal: to let the Starfighter fly as quickly and high as possible.This led to the first radiant overshade jet also called "widow maker" because many machines crashed.
The Starfighter was used in the German, the Italian, the American and the Japanese Air Force.He was pulled out of circulation in the mid-1990s.JHO

Cheap flyers have to repay subsidies / / The EU Commission wants to restrict the subsidization of low-cost airlines by state airports.A judgment against the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and the Belgian Charleroi airport has a model character for all EU airports, including the EuroAirport Basel.
Brussels / Basel.Mt.The Irish low -cost airline Ryanair, which has been subsidized by around 15 million euros from the Belgian regional airport Charleroi in the past five years, has to repay around a quarter of this support.
The EU Commission decided this in a long-awaited fundamental judgment.With this decision, EU transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio wants to achieve a greater "tran parental of the contractual conditions between the airlines and the airports".Despite the EU ban on government aid, however, the Commissioner accepted a large part of the Ryanair granted benefits.
The commissioner explained that the development of low -cost airlines and regional airports ensure competition and are in the interest of consumers.Ryanair boss Klagnganz Anders sees this Ryanair boss Michael O. Leary, who wants to complain against the decision at the European Court of Justice.He commented sneered: «The decision confirms that the EU Commission wants to increase costs and flight prices for consumers.»
Airport monopolies and expensive airlines would be favored.The airport, 70 km away from Brussels, belongs to the economically crisis -kiling region of Wallonia.This has a majority at the state airport operator Brussels South Charleroi Airport (BSCA).
Both the region and BSCA have concluded with Ryanair for over 15 years of contracts with extremely favorable conditions.These range from unusually deep landing fees and terminating costs, free of charge provided via free offices, assuming hotel accommodation costs for the crew and loss guarantees.Thanks to Ryanair, the formerly insignificant airport was able to increase its annual passenger number of 10,000 to today over two million.
The Commission's investigation began due to a lawsuit by the Zaventem Airport Brussels.The EU Commission particularly bothered that Ryanair Pro Passenger only had to pay one euro start and landing fee to the Walloon region, although the publicly announced tariff was twice as high.Therefore, Ryanair has to repay one million euros to Wallonia.
On the other hand, the commission also has a large extent approved by a large part of the discounts that the airport granted the airport.Aid to open new connections are allowed, for example, if they do not take longer than five years.The Commission also approved a sales promotion and advertising company operated by the BSCA together with Ryanair.
The Commission also needs more information from the parties for the exact amount of your recovery.Without the aid received, tickets for return flights would be more expensive for return flights by six to eight euros, Ryanair argued.De Palacio believes that after her decision, flight prices do not necessarily have to rise to the same extent.
She also pointed out that the cost of subsidizing airports is covered by the taxpayers.The Ryanair case has been pursuing the Euranair case with a lot of interest in the EuroAirport “With very keen interest”, explained his spokeswoman Vivienne Gaskell yesterday.In order to estimate the consequences, the judgment must first be analyzed.
Ryanair was interested in EuroAirport a year ago, but was rejected because of the extremely hard demands.The EuroAirport attaches importance to transparency and the dialogue with the existing customers, the spokeswoman said.Planned tariff changes would be discussed in a committee of the airport users.
Too cheap .The low -cost airline Ryanair was artificially cheap: now it has to repay around a quarter of the subsidies received of a total of 15 million euros.
Photo Keystone Komedtarnoch No transparency consumers benefit from the competition between different providers, i.e. between airlines.The companies and thus also their customers benefit from the competition between the airports.In order for airlines and airports in the uniform internal market to have the same skewers in competition, state subsidies are prohibited in the EU.
That is the theory and, according to the theory, Loyola de Palacio should have explained all subsidies to Ryanair as illegally.If there were no low -cost airlines, the predominantly state airlines still had a monopoly and thus the opportunity to raise high prices.If regional airports such as Charleroi had not tried to attract airlines with state -subsidized offers and thus make it easier for the low -cost airlines, there would still be only the large established airports that can start their prices high.
With her judgment, De Palacio tries to limit the subsidy race ultimately stored by the taxpayers without restricting the competition.Consumers of low -cost airlines and regions fighting for the work of their airports should not be stuck.The judgment is based on a compromise and does not ensure clear rules and thus the same skewer.

Swiss has retired six insufficient pilots / / The airline learned from the accident in Bassersdorf, eliminated a number of risk factors and also released pilots.By Erwin Haasdie
Swiss aviation had already switched on November 24, 2001 immediately after the accident.The main -affected crossair, today Swiss, immediately began with a “screening” of the cockpit personnel by non -company experts, as flight operations manager Manfred Brennwald explained before the press yesterday.By October 2002, Swiss examined 55 pilots for its suitability in a first step and sent them in retraining, one was released.
In a second thrust, all pilots had to take a review by April 2003, whether they had come to Swiss from the Crossair or the Swissair.25 needed flying tutoring, 11 were instructed through optimal cooperation in Cockpitteams, 5 were released.The suitability of the pilots for retraining for other aircraft types is also checked.
105 pilots have already been tested, 84 of them cut off well, 21 are not sufficient for retraining.Safety network Diligent diving At the organizational level, Swiss has drawn its teachings, implemented recommendations from the office for flight accident examinations and sometimes voluntarily improve further improvements.The pilot's application planning, which in the cockpit, should share the work efficiently and complement each other well, was systematized.
Only pilots with 5 flight years experience and at least 100 hours on this aircraft type.Swiss has a new database for the individual qualifications of the pilots, in which not only flying skills counts.The flight data are now also systematically collected on the regional fleet.
As was the case with the Swissair before her grounding, you can now see from all pilots when they have deviated from standard and limit values such as flight heights, top speeds, turbine speeds, and you must stand.The anonymous, impunity -free self -accusation in the event of misconduct of the pilots (reporting system), from which Swissair has already practiced, is now part of the security culture with the entire airline: everyone should learn from the errors and mistakes of colleagues, even if nothing has happened.
To promote and control the better security culture, Swiss has used a group of independent experts who regularly report to the Board of Directors.By the end of 2004, all Saab 2000 and jumbolinos of the regional fleet are said to be equipped with the latest generation of devices that warn of unintentional soil approach.Swiss and the Federal Office for Civil Aviation have not yet agreed on the safest standard procedure for the Eastern Aviation because, according to Brennwald, different solutions arise, according to Brennwald, depending on the aircraft.
After all, Swiss has now bought tailor -made, three -dimensionally legible flight path cards with a terrain profile on which all obstacles are drawn.Supervision of tightening the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL), which is accused of a lack of control of security quality in the crossair, has 10 more people in action today in order to meet their duty of supervision better, but wants to apply for even more staff.
In 2003, 180 inspections were carried out at all Swiss airlines, 30 of them in the field of training and training.However, nothing changes in the fact that the regular fitness tests of the Swiss pilots are taken from experts who themselves are employed by Swiss.It is not a different thing, said Göring, "otherwise the experts could not develop a know-how". Warning systems are also set up in the BFU report.
Of eight target workstations, only three were occupied at the time of the accident.The air traffic service manager had waited for the first eastern flight after 10 p.m., but then - three minutes before the crash - went home early.However, it lies in its competence to adapt the staff in the approach control point and in the tower to the volume of traffic.
And he was apparently of the opinion that eastern flights were justifiable in these weather conditions, so that despite the marginal perspective, he did not change the flight operations to northern flows with an instrument landing system (ILS).By 2005, the eastern flight slope 28 should also receive an ILS, the southern approach 34 by next autumn.Another technical lack of airport has now been remedied.
The slopes 28 and 34 (for eastern and southern flights) are now equipped with a warning system that draws the air traffic controllers on the screens if an aircraft drops too deeply on the landing approach.Before that (after the Alitalia-Hunglücks flight to the Stadlerberg 1990), only the north approaches were equipped with it.The pilots should learn from the mistakes and errors of their colleagues.

British Airways on a new travel flight / / The British airline was able to increase its passenger volume again in January.This is water on the optimists' mills.
From Dieter Claassender monthly traffic ID of the largest European airline in the industry is a kind of barometer for the weather conditions in international aviation.The British flagship receives 40 % of its income from important North Atlantic Transport;And it has more than others with cheap pilots like Ryanair and Easy Jet on their own front door.
The 3.5 percent increase in passenger miles flown by British Airways yesterday confirmed the continuation of the sector in January compared to January of the previous year.Company boss Rod Eddington had previously confirmed his confidence that his company would finally free himself from the turmoil and losses since the terrorist attacks in 2004 and 2005.The shareholders seem to believe him.
Since the publication of the traffic figures for December in early January, the British Airways share has made a set of around 30 %.Yesterday her course crumbled slightly;The investors had apparently promised even better numbers.
At the Dutch KLM, the volume of traffic was declining by 3 %.Business people flying reoriented with the British Airways course, the shares of the entire sector have climbed to a new travel level since the beginning of the year.The fear of terrorist attacks, the suspends of flights and the stubborn urging of Washington on the use of armed “Sky Marshalls”, the business travelers, which are particularly important for each airline, no longer seem to fly away.
According to Rod Eddington, they finally pay the "Premium Prices" and are full -paying.This is mainly an indication of the recovery of the global economy.Jim Higgins from Credit Suisse First Boston confirms the trend:
The income per seat mile in international air traffic was 12.9 % in November and in December by 13.6 % above the previous year's values.Of course, British Airways boss Eddington does not want to see himself as one of many who only breaks away on the wave of revitalization of aviation.Through his savings program, which was already launched in August 2001, he saved £ 1.7 billion with the reduction of almost 13,000 employees - every fifth place - and the thinning of the route network, although sales also broke up by 21 %.
But sales are now increasing again.In addition, the elimination of further 3000 jobs with the current staff of 45,000 should save an additional £ 300 million a year.Eddington: "This will contribute to a significant improvement in our margins." He is believed.
Even Chris Avery of J. P. Morgan, who had recently expected another loss, British Airways now trusts for the 2003/04 financial year and even £ 380 million for 2004 / 05. Chris ReadFrom Credit Suisse First Boston, an input tax of £ 553 million is possible for 2004/05.He relies on an “outperform” of the share and a target course of 342 pence within 12 months - 20 % more than today.

"Further crashes are permanently programmed" / / Crossair crash: Search for answer and responsibility / security has a priority, TA from the 4th 2. The aircraft crash of Bassersdorf on November 25, 2001 has been clarified.The blame is simple:
The pilot flew too deep.Here you could take a point and go to the agenda.Or you could critically notify the following:
The lock of the northern attack (implementation of the state contract) was just four weeks old.A day was needed to implement after the State Treaty was signed of October 18, 2001;The first landing on slopes 28 took place on October 19.
The Crossair's accident machine started in Berlin with several hours late.As a result, it did not land north (ILS) as intended, but from the east.Eight minutes were missing!
(10:08 p.m. the crash was, from 10 p.m. the north approach was closed.) There was a blizzard, no view.Pilot errors or not, the circumstances that led to this should definitely be considered!
Ralph Weidenmann, Nürensdorferwin Haas, rightly states in his comment that the Federal Council was imposed on 8 p.m.This, although you were not ready for this for various reasons.The comment therefore sounds good.
For the sake of completeness, however, it must be attached that in my opinion, the TA has rarely taken such a clear attitude on questions of the arrival regime.Hans R. Burri, Zuriches is not easy to understand what it means for someone to survive in an air disaster if most people find death.The statement by Jacqueline Badran deserves attention to presenting the causes of the accident.
She emphasizes that in addition to the main responsible persons, the entire society is also obliged to learn from an accident like that in Bassersdorf.If research is carried out after the responsibility for the catastrophe, I am completely in agreement with her that we all have a shared responsibility to publicly say what is also part of.Namely what it describes "the ideology of unlimited mobility".
In a limited, limited world, nothing can be unlimited.If it is done anyway, how if unlimited offers should be something useful in the long run, then the question has to be loud: Who does that serve?Who benefits from it?
The greater the "convenience" is praised to fly or ride on every planned or unplanned time, the less security is possible.So I am firmly convinced that “non -profession” must also say their opinion.You will not interfere with the competence of the experts.
But as people who have a sense of borders - and that is the sense of life - they (hopefully) will (hopefully) express their opinion from this sense and to name more and more things that would otherwise remain unnamed.Ciril Berther, Oetwil / Limmat
Theologian and organizational consultant on the "Tages-Anzeiger": "When it comes to security, political demands have only a second priority.»This realization does not seem to have been received by the politicians!
Everyone is sure that many more people are threatened with southern flights.Nevertheless, they take place.These southern flights can only take place because the security of the residents has second priority.
Federal Councilor Leuenberger has only spoken of the security of the aircraft and their passengers.He never mentioned the security of the residents.
There is only one solution for security reasons: flight movements must be channeled!Rodolfo
As far as I know, Valentino, Dübendorf after the aircraft falls in Nassenwil and Bassersdorf, a third Crossair-Gau occurred: In a storm, the air traffic management of a first alternative airport arranged the approach of a second.As a result of fuel lack of fuel, the pilots then had to make an emergency landing on a disused airfield, with the chassis being torn down on a crosswall of the locked slope and fortunately nobody was injured, only the plane suffered total damage.
It is to be feared that the accident investigation will show that the pilots should never have accepted the alternative instructions due to insufficient fuel stocks and should have insisted on land permit.Or did the pilots know their fuel supply due to organizational or technical mistakes, or are there other causes?In this case, too, there is public interest in relentless information.
Other disasters - for example crashes in Schwamendingen - are firmly programmed if the current environment is not immediately shattered and rebuilt.Urs Baumgartner, Fällandenbild Martin Rüetschi /

German Ordinance for a third fulfilled / / The exceptional rule for northern flights during the flight blocking times over southern Germany was often used in the winter months.To the south, 4 percent of all approaches have been available to Zurich Airport since the beginning of October.
Since October 30, 2003, Zurich Airport has been flown to the German flight blocking times from the south on 49 days.In November, no southern flights were possible on 20 days due to the disabilities due to fog.In December, this number was reduced to 12 days, in January to 10 days.
So far, it was flown from south every day in February.According to the statistics from Unique, a total of 1173 approaches have taken place 34 over the past 100 days, 53 of which in the evening.Basically, the landings in the evening (from 9 p.m. on working days, from 8 p.m. on weekends) must be led from east to slopes 28.
If this proves to be too short - for example in the case of wet or tailwind - piste 34 is flown in if this allows the view.In the south, evening atriums were carried out on December 3rd, 6th and 7th and on January 31.Frequent change of regime
Weekends and southern German holidays were only partially possible several times during the three -hour blocking period in the morning (6 a.m. to 9 a.m.).Skyguide air traffic control had to apply for the permission for northern atriums on the slopes equipped with instrument landing systems (ILS) 14 and 16.As soon as the weather allowed, Skyguide changed the arrival regime.
On December 27, the unsatisfactory situation arose that in the three hours of the morning both from the north and from the south and east had to be landed.According to the current flight schedule, an average of 20 aircraft in Zurich will arrive on working days from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m., 65 on weekends from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.. So far, only a third of the entire flight traffic has been led to slopes 34 during the German blocking times in the morning.Counted all day, the airport recorded a total of 30 752 approaches from October 30, 2003 to February 5, 2004.
There were 4 percent of all landings to the south (see graphic). More movements for the south of the approaching lighter season, the exemption of the German Ordinance (permission of northern flights with insufficient perspective for landings on slopes 34 and 28) will be claimed less often.At the end of April, the localizer on slopes 34 will also be available to an additional navigation aid (precision approach in the direction of slopes).The minimum for the horizontal point of view of currently 4500 meters is adapted to the technical equipment and, according to the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL), should be reduced to around half.
Since a visual minimum of 4,500 meters applies to slopes 28, depending on the weather, an increase in the southern flights in the evening can be expected, because the north approach is only considered when slopes 28 and 34 cannot be landed.The complete ILS for slopes 34 will be ready for operation in October 2004.A year later, slope 28 is said to be equipped with an equivalent ILS, which will allow more landings from the east again.
Germany had made it clear when the one -sided regulation was issued in April 2003 that it wanted to gradually restrict the flight movements over the German area.The Ministry of Transport in Berlin has not yet drawn up a second, tightened regulation (NZZ 3. 04).It is considered both a movement plan and an expansion of the night flight ban on working days and on weekends.

Aircraft crash in the Emirates / / Dubai, February 10.(AP)
The crash of an Iranian commercial aircraft on the country's approach to the United Arab Emirates cost 43 people on Tuesday.According to the authorities, only 3 of the 46 passengers and crew members survived the crash shortly before Sharja Airport.2 of them are in a critical condition, according to reports from the al-Kasimi clinic.
The cause of the accident is not yet known.No emergency call on the machine of the Iranian airline Kish Air would not have made a emergency call, the aviation authority reported in Sharja.Flight writers and voice recorder have already been recovered and should now provide information about the cause of the crash.
Kish Air in Tehran rejected every statement.The Fokker 50, which can accommodate up to 60 people, plunged to unexpected land about 3 kilometers in front of the runway and around 200 meters from a residential area, about 3 kilometers in front of the runway and around 200 meters.According to the authorities, the plane came from the Iranian island of Kish in the Persian Gulf and was also supposed to return there.
This short route is often used by foreign workers who have to leave the Emirates for a short time to apply for a new visa.Of the 43 fatalities, 19 came from Iran, 12 from India, 4 from Egypt, 2 from the Philippines and from Algeria as well as one from Syria, China, Bangladesh and Nigeria, as the police said.According to reports from the official news agency, some of them died on the way to the hospital.
Local television showed pictures of flames that shot out of the front part of the machine.Only the bug and rear of the machine were still recognizable after the crash.Rescue helicopters landed near the scene of the accident, rescue workers searched for any survivors in the ruins.
According to the Dutch company Stork, the accident machine was eleven -year -old, according to information from the Dutch company Stork, which took over a large part of its shares after the collapse of Fokker eight years ago.This made the plane far younger than most machines in the aging Iranian fleet.The basic maintenance work was carried out by Fokker Services, said a Stork spokesman;

In the deep flight pre -monitored / / Questions about mysterious flight object: A Boeing 747 broke yesterday across the middle - in deep flight.Shortly after noon, the phone rang not only at the editorial team of this newspaper, but also at the air safety company Skyguide in Zurich.
Concerned citizens reported the deep flight of a Boeing 747 over the Swiss Mittelland.Skyguide spokesman Patrick Herr was able to calm down the excited minds quickly: the jumbo, which was only around 300 meters above ground, was a registered test flight of a freight aircraft from the Dutch airline Martinair.
This was also confirmed by their press spokesman Erik van Doeselaar.Normal security tests, which caused a sensitive deep flight, Martinair checked the so-called ground proximity warning system in the cockpit of the jumbos.
A security system that gives the alarm when a machine flies too close to the ground.The alarm system has recently increasingly moved to the center of interest, especially in connection with the crossair crash in Bassersdorf (we reported). The best way to carry out the security test in hilly areas - of which there are as is less common in the Netherlands - be oneFlew through the Swiss Mittelland, says van Doeselaar.In addition, the visual relationships were ideal in Switzerland at this time.
The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) and Grenchen Airport, which had also already become aware of the Dutch giants, confirmed that such test flights are not unusual, especially in the Middle edge.Nevertheless, the Boeing 747 deep flight caused some confusion yesterday.In the “Alone” vision area, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation was initially not able to provide any precise information.
This is despite the fact that Martinair spokesman Van Doeselaar spoke of a "approved" test flight.Finally, light into the dark brought Skyguide: In this case, the airline in question only needs to be approved to pretend or leave it again in the controlled Swiss airspace, explains Skyguide spokesman Patrick Herr.
But not an approval for the actual deep flight.If a machine flies below 300 meters from the ground, it automatically leaves the controlled zone and goes to the Visual Flight Room, visual space."See and be seen" are the traffic rule there, says Herr.
This was also the case for the gigantic Boeing 747 from Holland yesterday: for them, too, the same conditions under 300 meters also prevailed for any sports, hobby or small aircraft.KHL

EU approved fusion of Air France and KLM / HT.Brussels, 11.
Februardie EU Commission approved the merger of Air France with the Dutch airline KLM under conditions on Wednesday.To remedy competition law concerns, the airlines have to hand in 47 slots pairs or 94 individual slots (time window for start or landing) per day in unlimited duration in order to enable competitors to accommodate 31 new return flights.
Although according to the Brussels competitive huts, the route networks of the two companies are largely complementary, the merger on nine routes between Amsterdam and French or Italian airports as well as five long distances would have eliminated or reduced the competition.Other concessions include granting traffic rights for intermediate landings in Amsterdam or Paris on flights to the USA or other destinations outside the EU.According to the information from the Reuters agency, the US Justice Ministry has also approved the transaction law.
According to the agreement announced at the end of September, Air France will take control of KLM through a share exchange, which creates the largest aviation group in Europe.At the same time, according to the Commission, it is “the first real fusion” in European air traffic.The case showed, commented on competition commissioner Monti, that the long -awaited consolidation of the sector can be achieved with full respect for the competitive rules.
The Commission reminded that it always looked at the consolidation benevolently, but that it should not be at the expense of consumers.On the other hand, the separate examination of an alliance between Air France and Alitalia has not yet been completed.Here, too, it's all about slots.

Fusion to the delight of passengers / / Air France and KLM are allowed to merge - but not at the expense of passengers.The EU has made a pioneering decision for the industry.
By Stefan Brändle, Pariseu Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is satisfied.The decision made on Wednesday evening in favor of the fusion of Air France and KLM shows that "the consolidation of European aviation is possible with full maintenance of the competition rules".In other words: the air travelers could benefit from the first major airline.
The merger gives KLM passengers connection to 90 Air France destinations in southern Europe, Africa and America;For the customers of the French carrier, the district expands by 40 KLM targets in Northern Europe and America.The downside of the medal:
On individual routes, such as Amsterdam-Paris, the two companies together become almost unrivaled, which could give prices.The EU wants to counter this with new requirements.Air France and KLM have to cede a number of flight rights on 14 lines.
Definitely, while these slots have so far been reinforced depending on the circumstances and business course.Other airlines are not bound.If the competition should compress or if the high -speed train (TGV) takes away too many customers between France and Holland, you will receive entitlement to other slots from Air France or KLM under certain circumstances.
The French and Dutch authorities are no longer allowed to fix minimum prices on national routes to disadvantage cheap airlines to Air France or KLM.According to reports, for example, Easy Jet has already registered interest in the six free back and forth flights between Paris and Amsterdam weeks before the green light of the EU.Other interested parties are ready.
Because the airports of Paris and Amsterdam - alongside Frankfurt and London the most important hubs in Europe - had to commit themselves to grant additional intermediate landings on transatlantic flights to other airlines.Monti is convinced that these EU requirements prevent higher tariffs for passengers.The EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio said that the decision will "promote the development of lowcost airlines". Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta, who will probably manage the merged company, cannot hide his satisfaction.
This relativizes the comments of Paris media about "strict EU requirements".The newspaper “Le Monde” said secretly breathe spinetta.With the Brussels decision, the main hurdle in the formation of this European pioneering company has been removed.
According to the EU, the United States immediately granted green light;This should have the partner agreements of Air France and KLM with Delta or Northwest and Continental.With your Allianz Skyteam you will compete with the Markt leader OneWorld (British Airways) and Star Alliance (Lufthansa).
After sales (19.2 billion euros), Air France and KLM form the world's largest airline;After the passenger volume, they are behind United and American.540 aircraft and 106,000 employees serve 226 destinations.
Whether the 60 million passengers really benefit from the merger must be shown.Airnial experts expect the merger to have further cooperation in Europe.Alitalia wants to join Air France, Lufthansa is looking at Iberia after the Scandinavian SAS and British Airways after she has already received a codesharing agreement with Swiss.
In November, Swiss boss André Dosé said that a merger with British was "not on the agenda".The unthinkable Franco Dutch alliance a year ago, however, may have changed various agenda lists.The merger of Air France and KLM has consequences for the entire industry.

Zurich is Europe's airport with most delays / / 30 percent of all starts took place late at Zurich Airport - European record.By Marcel Speiser
"Zurich made up a lot to the competition," Swiss boss André Dosé is quoted on the website of the Zurich airport.In relation to the infrastructure, this may be true, the opposite applies in relation to punctuality.The Zurich airport was the European airport with the most delays last year (see graphic).
Specifically, 29.9 percent of all departures took place with a delay of more than 15 minutes.This emerges from statistics that the Association of European Airlines published on Friday.The delays in internal European traffic at the 27 most important airports in Europe were examined.
Average 19 percent of all starts were late.Not only the proportion of late flights of almost a third is a bad testimony to Zurich Airport.The tendency is also unpleasant:
Of the 27 airports examined, 22 have improved the proportion of delay compared to the previous year's values, only five airports, including Zurich, worsened.But while Istanbul, Munich, Vienna and Düsseldorf deteriorated by just 2.3 percentage points, the proportion of late starts in Zurich increased by 11.4 percentage points.Therefore, Zurich ranked from 18th place in the delay ranking to 1st place. «The delay problem is unsustainable.
We recognized the problem, »says airport spokesman Andreas Siegenthaler the sobering statistics.Unique had already performed an “airport steering” (airport control) last autumn, in which all parties are looking for solutions.The main reason for the High Zurich delay is apparently in poor coordination between Swissport, Unique, SR Technics and other companies involved.
In any case, the restriction of the northern flights is not to blame for everything.The frequent delays on her home base are particularly serious for the main customer of Zurich Airport, the Swiss.It advertises the Swiss main attribute of punctuality, but cannot always keep this promise.
33 percent of their European lies from Zurich had more than 15 minutes late in 2003 - 33 minutes on average.SWISS is even anger in intercontinental transport: practically half of all flights

Flying from Basel Billig to Berlin and London / / The low-cost airline Easyjet comes to the EuroAirport and wants to expand it into a European basis with four stationed aircraft.The director of Easyjet Switzerland estimates the potential of the three flights for 250,000 to 300,000 passengers for the time being.
EuroAirport.Finally a ray of hope.After several bad news, those responsible for the EuroAirport at yesterday's media conference were able to report something positive:
The low -cost airline Easyjet comes to the binational airport.And he not only flies from Basel to London Stansted once a day, as was announced on Thursday (BAZ from February 13, 2004), but also twice a day to Berlin.Soon a million passengers? "This is a big and important day for us," said Maurice Amiel, Board of Directors of the Airport.
Jean-Marc Thévenaz, General Manager of Easyjet Switzerland, took the view that 250,000 to 300,000 passengers should be generated with the three daily return flights.It can be a million within three years."We will develop Basel at the expense of Zurich," he continued.
Easyjet has already stopped two out of five daily connections between Zurich and London.And the other three?"We'll probably stop completely," said Thévenaz.
He was anything but good at Unique: «He is one of the most expensive airports in Europe, there are many restrictions and the problems with southern Germany.The airport does not fit for the low-cost model. »Among other things, the low-cost airlines earn money because the planes are as often as possible in the air and as little as possible.Thévenaz plans to reduce the time between the parking of the engines after landing and letting it back to 20 minutes.
Airport director Jürg Rämi commented: «We have very short distances.This is a high goal, but feasible.»Easyjet has been in Switzerland since 1998 and has currently stationed five aircraft in Geneva and 350 employees there.
Ten percent of the annual turnover of CHF 2 billion in 2003 comes from Switzerland.From CHF 39 to Berlineasyjet flies with Airbus 319, which can accommodate 156 passengers.The cheapest price for the flights from Basel to Berlin or London is CHF 39 for one direction.
The longer you wait with the booking and the fuller the machine is, the more expensive it gets.If you buy your ticket at the last moment, you can pay up to CHF 300.The average price is 100 francs.
Books on the Internet and paid by credit card.When introducing a new line, there are always cheapest special offers."We want to get used to customers," said Thévenaz.
The flights to London begin on March 28th and those to Berlin on May 20.Better Airbus than Saab "It is possible that Basel will become a new European base with a permanently stationed aircraft," continued Jean-Marc Thévenaz.There are currently five aircraft in Geneva and it is conceivable to increase this number to ten and have four in Basel.
«We currently serve 45 destinations.There is still a lot of potential, »he was convinced.There are currently three daily connections from EuroAirport to Berlin and London from Swiss and British Airways, which will come under competing pressure.
Isn't there a risk that they will be set by coming from Easyjet?Maurice Amiel denies this and the representative of Easyjet argues that the low -cost airlines only chase off the competitor passengers, because 80 percent generate new traffic.Nevertheless, the expensive and long flights with the uncomfortable and loud Saab 2000 and Saab 340 to Berlin should soon be stopped in the medium term due to a lack of demand, because business customers are also no masochists if they can have it cheaper faster.
Despite the good news, the airport managers were well aware that "a swallow does not yet make spring," as Eduard Belser, Vice President of the Board of Directors, noticed after the media conference to the BAZ.«We only solved one problem and have to rebuild the European network.The search continues, »emphasized Maurice Amiel.
Now the board of directors must first draw up and adopt the new fee schedule.Only then can the contract be signed with Easyjet.However, this should be done quickly, because negotiations with the low -cost airline started in summer.
Peter Schenkwww.easyjet.comBilligflieger at the EuroAirport.Easyjet will fly to London from March 28 and from May 20 to Berlin.Because those responsible for the airline are dissatisfied with the framework conditions in Zurich, they are considering stopping there and building a European basis in Basel.

Little punctuality in air traffic / / EGE.According to the surveys of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), Zurich Airport recorded the most delays last year compared to the important airports in Europe.29.9 percent of the departures were late by more than 15 minutes.
It was 22.3 percent of the arrivals.The delays in Zurich have increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2003. In the middle of the year, Zurich was able to improve five places in the punctuality comparison with 27 European airports.
In the 2003 annual statistics, Zurich now takes first place in unpunctual airports: in front of Rome, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Milan Malpensa and Istanbul.Of the 27 airports that are recorded in AEA statistics, only 5 more delays (Zurich, Istanbul, Munich, Vienna, Düsseldorf) recorded).Overall, the AEA determines a slight improvement in punctuality in internal European flights.
The proportion of late flights (more than 15 minutes) fell from 19.9 percent (2002) to 19.1 percent (2003).In comparison to 30 airlines, the Swiss is in 21st place in terms of punctuality. In Europe traffic, a third of the Swiss flights started, in intercontinental traffic half of the Swiss machines with an average delay of half an hour.
Flight delays can arise both when it comes to handling on the ground and in airspace.The airport company recognized that the processes on the ground have to be improved and made efforts for better cooperation between the various partners.Among other things, the flight blocks over southern Germany have an impact on air traffic control, which restrict the capacities with the approaches to slopes 28 and 34.
The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) prescribed a reduction in the starting capacities, the effect of which is still being relyed on December 12, 2003.As was known over the weekend, the special constellation has been reduced to slopes on slopes 14 and parallel starts on slopes 16, the number of landings has so far reduced from 36 to 40 per hour to 23 to 28.The number of departures was reduced from 44 to 30 per hour.
According to the Swiss, the new restrictions are particularly noticeable in the peak time between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m.The BAZL had ordered the restrictions on the basis of a recommendation from the Flight Accident Investigation Office (BFU).The BFU's security recommendation took place from the preliminary findings of the examination of a dangerous approach from two aircraft last August.

Capacity for Zurich Airport restricted / / After a almost compilation, Zurich Airport had to reduce the number of access and departure for security reasons.Zurich .
Sda.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) reduced the capacities at Zurich Airport on December 12, as announced on Sunday.The Federal Office reacted to a fast merging of two aircraft in August last year.
The office for flight accident investigations (BFU) formulated security recommendations for preliminary findings on the incident, Patrick Herr, spokesman for the skyguide flight protection company, explained on request.Skyguide is now implementing these recommendations on the instruction of the Bazl, Herr confirmed a report by the “NZZ am Sonntag”. From a fast combination, one speaks when a pilot is undesirably subject to the safety distance of five miles (eight kilometers).The final report on the fast collision is not yet available.
However, it is common for security regulations to be implemented on the basis of first findings, said the Skyguide spokesman.The effects on flight operations were difficult to estimate: a capacity reduction contributes to more delays.
However, this is only one factor among many.The restrictions stipulate that with parallel use of the slopes 14 and 16 per hour, only 23 to 28 instead of 36 to 40 landings as before.The number of permissible starts was reduced from 44 to 30 per hour.
The airport operator Unique did not comment on the capacity restrictions on Sunday.The airline Swiss has been flying since the introduction of the new Bazl regulations with larger delays, said Swiss spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel.The influence of the restrictions is not quantifiable, but it is obvious - especially at peak times between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.
Both Zurich Airport and the Swiss airline have a punctuality problem anyway.According to statistics from the Association of European Airlines (AEA), Zurich Airport recorded most frequently among the more important airports in Europe in 2003.Swiss is only 21 compared to thirty airlines. This makes the restrictions difficult for punctual flight operations, they know at the Bazl.
"Security has a priority for the department for the environment, transport, energy and communication," said Bazl spokeswoman Célestine Perissinotto.However, the airport operator Unique is invited to make suggestions at any time on how the capacities in Zurich-Kloten could be increased again.Perissinotto explains with the amount of security recommendations from the BFU: «The BFU makes many recommendations that the new provisions were not known earlier, we do not all know.

Leuenberger counters allegations / / especially for security reasons, the transport minister says in an interview with the TA, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation has not informed about new measures.By Jean-Martin Büttner,
Bernmoritz Leuenberger admits: his Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) could have made it public that it has restricted the number of starts and landings via Zurich clot."You can discuss that," he says in a TA talk.
The Bazl had limited the flight movements in mid -December.It reacted to an almost combination of Zurich Kloten last August.Both and Kloten also had silent about this incident;
Both facts were made known by the “NZZ on Sunday”.The pilots of the pilots of media shreddass have not been officially communicated, Leuenberger explains with security.«We have a great interest in the fact that affected pilots report incidents - even if they have made a mistake themselves.»
The fear of public prejudices and media scolding can prevent pilots from reporting.«From this point of view, a non -publication can be in the public interest.»The Minister of Transport Sharp, on the other hand, that secrecy is operated in the Federal Office for Civil Aviation;
He sees such an allegation as a "journalistic mistake". To speak, there is another decision in which Leuenberger is involved.Last week, the new finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz took over the management of the Federal Council committee, who deals with Swiss.What looks like a creeping disempowerment, explains Leuenberger, far less dramatic, with very practical reasons.
Since there are now primarily financial questions about the Swiss for debate, Merz takes over the management of the delegation.He himself took over it from Kaspar Villiger when the air traffic control was about Skyguide and other things.Here, too, it was by no means a matter of hiding anything.
In connection with the problems related to the Swiss and Unique, the Minister of Transport confirms that he had asked the general council whether he should leave the flight dossier to an counterpart.The entire Federal Council rejected.
How he himself is in the matter - Leuenberger only answers this question indirectly: "In such a question, I would certainly not be overruled." Comment 5.

It is not only the four accidents with a total of 334 deaths in Halifax, Niederhasli, Bassersdorf and Überlingen who shaked confidence in the industry.From the thicket of responsibilities, it is becoming increasingly clear that the airlines were too carefree and that the inspectors took too little for too long.The Swiss, the air traffic controllers, the aviation office learned from the mistakes;
The Leuenberger department tightened the supervision.But instead of communicating everything openly, they keep important knowledge and measures to themselves.This creates the uncertainty that many residents moved in the approach lane:
Who can you even trust?Everyone is talking about the hot porridge.Not even improvements are announced.
In this circle of secrecy, the Swiss and Zurich Airport play their roles particularly bad under his boss Josef Felder.You will only inform when you have to admit something.The airport is already called "Lughafen".
Instead of providing transparent, they try to make politics with information: it cannot be a coincidence that the reduction of starts and landings that are colliding at the start of collision has become known.Unique is presenting the preliminary operating regulations today.
The message that the capacity has been reduced will increase the pressure to allow unique new flight paths and the free use of all slopes.You can argue about whether the opponents of East and south-facing flights are allowed to emphasize the aspect of flight safety just to keep aircraft noise away.On the other hand, they are rightly protesting if, for security reasons, more aircraft noise is burdened for them so that the airport can grow.
The actual question means: even more flights or more quality of life?Moritz Leuenberger and his colleagues in the Federal Council should finally explain how much and what air traffic this country needs.But this is why political will be needed.

"The most important thing is security" / / Transport Minister Leuenberger reacts to persistent allegations that his Federal Office for Civil Aviation Communicates communicate too little, too late or not at all.Jean-Martin Büttner, Bernherr Federal Council, spoke to Moritz Leuenberger:
On December 12th, its Federal Office for Civil Aviation had flight restrictions for Kloten Airport.The reason was an almost compilation last August.Neither the Bazl nor the airport management made this information public.
Is there any other important detail about the safety of Kloten Airport, which the flight passengers should know?The question includes an inaccurate claim, namely that, if possible, the population had not been explained by something that should have been informed about which it should have been informed for security reasons.However, this is by no means the case.
To blame the Bazl even "secrecy", or it would "hide" something as written, I consider a journalistic mistake.The instruction of the Bazl was by no means secret;It has not yet been actively published, but the airport could have done that without any further notice.
Incidentally, the Bazl made the decision in favor of security.I have previously set several, including personnel, that should enable such decisions to improve the safety of air traffic.It starts to grab now.
The decision of the Bazl can also be seen in this context.The most important thing for us remains security, i.e. the decision itself.Nobody denies that.
And it would have been one more reason to make the decision public.Yes, maybe the Bazl should have given its decision in December, contrary to its normal practice, you can discuss this.There are reasons for it and against it.
Only this has nothing to do with secrecy and is not a "scandal" either.In any case, the reliability did not require the publication.Public interest and medial curiosity are not always synonymous.
If not secrecy - what then?The measure of the Bazl goes back to an almost merging.Each such case triggers an examination with a final report that is always published.
This is not yet possible here because the final report is not yet finished.The Bazl did not prevent this from making the decisive immediate measure.It has a lot to do with certainty that the almost compilation is not immediately made public.
We have a great interest in the fact that affected pilots report incidents - even if you have made a mistake yourself.The final report, which is also published, then shows which errors were celebrated.The fear of public prejudices, but can prevent pilots from reporting from media scolding.
From this point of view, a non -publication in the public interest can be, namely to strengthen security.It is not the first time that the Bazl is accused of poor communication.Two weeks ago, for example, one could read that Germany wanted to limit the approaches to southern Germany to 80,000 and confronted the Bazl.
This did not want to comment on it.It is true that communication is very reserved in this case, and it is deliberately so.We know that Southern Germany is demanding from Berlin to massively reduce the landing flights across the German field.
This is to the detriment of Switzerland.The more we discuss this in public, the stronger the internal German pressure becomes.We cannot be interested in that.
This is precisely why a negotiator often comes into the unpleasant situation, for reasons of negotiation tactics not to say everything he knows, so as not to endanger the Swiss cause.Again and again it is weaned, the Federal Council sacrifices the well -being of the population of the air noise.I've never heard that before.
If one would say that the well -being of the population is sacrificed to the economic interests of the airport, this is correct to a certain extent.But that has nothing to do with foreign policy.Last week, her colleague Hans-Rudolf Merz took over the management of the Federal Council committee to the Swiss.
Why didn't you make this change public?My staff would have liked a publication, the overall Federal Council was against it.Here, too, it was not about hiding something.
It was a question of discretion.Kaspar Villiger managed this delegation earlier, then I did it, now it is Hans-Rudolf Merz.This has to do with the relocation of the tasks of the committee.
When I took over the management, it was about the framework conditions for the Swiss, the air traffic control skyguide and other things.Now the discussion focuses a little more on the financial situation of the Swiss;So it is correct if the finance minister heads the committee.
At the next session you would have said publicly anyway.One hears again and again in a greater connection, they wanted to cede the whole flight dossier to another Federal Council.The SVP raised the claim.
I then asked the entire Federal Council what it thinks of it.He was against it.That is known ;
We are interested in how you personally stand.There is a decision by the overall Federal Council that the dossier stays with me.Without violating the secret of the session:
In such a question, I would certainly not be overruled.Switzerland is investigating the one -sided German flight restrictions at the European Court of Justice.How big do you think the chance of a positive decision?
We believe that success is possible.Otherwise we would have had to do without. "Public interest and medial curiosity are not always synonymous." Image Beatrice Devenes "I think that is a journalistic mistake":

Moritz Leuenberger gets even more under fire / / After Zurich Airport had to reduce its starting capacities, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation is not only under pressure.Federal Councilor Leuenberger is also criticized.
· Bernhard Kislige is analyzed a lot and announced a lot.«But what has changed in concrete and sustainably is beyond my knowledge.»The criticism of CVP general secretary Reto Nause goes to the address of the traffic department (Uvek).
His boss Moritz Leuenberger accuses him of implementing urgent reforms."A wrong decision is also to be used in the BAZL for a long time for a long time," criticizes Nause, who himself worked in a pilot association until a few years ago.The Bazl - which works in the sensitive area of flight safety - has been in a desolate state for far too long.
And Moritz Leuenberger handle too little.The current vertebrae about the information policy of the Federal Civil Aviation (BAZL) office is an indirect consequence of it.After a FASTOUSSISTESTHESTHEBSTISt from two aircraft, the number of starts and landings was restricted at Kloten Airport from mid -December.
The Bazl has never informed about the incident nor about its instructions.Nause mentions, the incident should probably be kept under closure.Finally, air traffic is only one of three large Uvek construction sites in the Leuenberger department.
Nause speaks of further "open fire" such as the NEAT or the unresolved problems related to electricity market liberalization.Leuenberger is also criticized from the SVP headquarters.And FDP National Councilor Georges Theiler demands that the dossier be given to Germany about the air traffic negotiations with Germany: «If a negotiation delegation has failed, you must not use the same team again.»
Switzerland filed a lawsuit against the German approach restrictions on Friday at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.No rapid school spokesman Hugo Schittenhelm shows Nauses
Criticism of the interim bazl line back: «Due to the complex requirement profile, it is not easy to find a new Bazl director.»Quick shots, only to fill the position as quickly as possible, are therefore out of place.
Bazl boss André Auer had to vacate his post in the problem-loaded Federal Office at the end of August.By the end of April, Max Friedli, director of the Federal Office of Transport, now has the Bazl under his wing.Schittenhelm blames the BAZL for information about the Fasting Personal and the subsequent restriction of starts and landings.
And he admits that it would be conceivable to inform politically delicate topics that are in the public focus in this way.Bazl spokeswoman Célestine Perissinotto also says: «Yes, maybe we could have informed that.»Why wasn't it informed about the additional restrictions for the crisis flight operations?
Firstly, the BAZL would enact many measures so that the information center could impossible to carry everything to the public, explains Perissinotto.Secondly, the restriction mentioned is only a provisional measure.BFU needed 4
For monthly, experts are criticized that 4 months have passed from Fasting in August 2003 to the tightened security regulations for starting and landing."The BAZL received the recommendation from the Flight Accident Accident Investigation Office (BFU) in early December and issued the appropriate instruction after a few days," says Perissinotto.So the BFU examination lasted almost 4 months.

Higher quarterly win from Air France / / The Air France airline in the third quarter of its financial year, which expires at the end of March, achieved an operating profit of EUR 61 million thanks to the higher volume of traffic and increased capacity utilization.In the previous year, the operating profit was only 2 million euros;
Taking into account the changed bookkeeping rules, the Pro-forma comparison number is EUR 32 million.With a quarter turnover of EUR 3.13 billion - practically unchanged compared to the previous year, despite the increasing price of the euro - a profit before taxes of EUR 41 million, compared to EUR 3 million and per forma 33 million euros.Sales growth of 3.7 % is calculated at constant courses.
The income from the passenger transport increased by 0.6 % to EUR 2.59 billion, the freight business shrank by 5.7 % to EUR 379 million, and maintenance work headed for EUR 117 million, 4.1 % more.For the first nine months of the financial year there is a taxable profit of EUR 126 million;The decline of 55.9 % is due to losses in the first semester by sars and strikes.
The debt rate has improved to 65 % (71 % March 2003).A positive degree is expected for the year as a whole.Ug.

Airport wants to have more freedom / / Unique requires enough airspace for smooth flight operations and the free use of the slopes.Seven hours of sleep serve as a draw for the population.
Von Erwin Haasende 2003 had to submit the application for a temporary operating regulations for entrance and departure at Zurich Airport at the Federal Office of Civil Aviation.Unique had announced that “essentially” corresponds to the summary of the provisional changes that have been brought about by the German approach barriers on the Rhine since 2001.What airport boss Josef Felder and his head of operations Rainer Hiltebrand presented to the media yesterday now contains a little more:
The operating regulations are based on the number of 350,000 movements per year and summarizes “past adjustments, compelling future changes (German access locks, waiting room laying) and company wishes” by Unique.The population -friendly application first: seven hours of sleep.From 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., neither should be started nor landed in Kloten, with exceptions:
If there have been delays over the day that could not be reduced until night, aircraft that have stopped should be allowed to start until 11:30 p.m.According to previous statistics, this night lock affects around 220 movements between 11:30 p.m. and 00.30 a.m., which would no longer be possible with the provisional operating regulations, and 800 movements between 5.30 a.m. and 6 a.m.With this night true regulation, Zurich would be a lonely pioneer among the European major airports.
The most drastic change: Unique wants to be able to use the existing slopes flexibly as required.So far, starts towards the west via Rümlang (on slopes 28) and south via Glattbrugg (rune 16) before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m.The aircraft had to start north in these night round hours (slopes 32 and 34).
Unique is now applying for free, efficient use of all starting slopes from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.Starts should only be prescribed north from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.The result would be - except when flown in from the south - more starts via Glattbrugg, Schwamendingen and Valaisellen, but also more direct depreciation routes in the east.
For many flights that curve east after the start of the Limmattal and the city of Zurich, this detour would be omitted.According to Unique, the flexibility enables the reduction of delays during the day despite a long night's sleep.In terms of
It means burden that the population has to expect aircraft noise almost anywhere and at any time.This also includes the operating variant, while the German approach lock times almost simultaneously coordinated landings from the east and from the south when there is great demand for capacity.However, this procedure must first be certified.
It comes the worst for the south.In the future, around a third of the aircraft starting on slopes 16 via Glattbrugg will no longer run their mandatory left curve over Valaisellen and the Hardwald, but now via Dübendorf, Wangen-Brüttisellen and Volketswil towards Illnau until the jets is a height of 1200 meters aboveHave reached sea.Only then would they swing in on existing departure routes.
According to Unique, this procedure would be used primarily in the event of poor perspective and concerns about a third of all aircraft that start on slopes 16 today: 11,000 per year or 30 a day.The reason for this procedure is a security problem that the Bazl had defused in December with a restriction of capacity (TA from Monday):
If an aircraft flies the previous left curve after the southern start and at the same time an aircraft has to start from the north on the landing approach to slopes 14, there is potential for conflict.This is avoided with the “wide left curve” because the parallel cornering routes are far enough apart.The BAZL's decision, which in December obtained the better unbundling of the simultaneous start and landings, has reduced the capacity of the airport by 21 percent between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. and led to delays.
New waiting rooms, new flight path changes in the height of the flight route are expected by laying two waiting rooms to Switzerland, which are now located over German areas.The relocation was a concession of Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger to his German counterpart Manfred Stolpe last June.Leuenberger achieved that Germany extended the deadline for the introduction of the southern flights by October and did not force the airport to stand it temporarily.
Image Thomas Burlaflughafen boss Josef Felder demands more freedom of movement for Unique in Kloten.
Unique wants to secure the necessary capacity with free use of the slopes.Objections possible until the Federal Court of German restrictions are temporarily determined - that's why it was time for an overall view, said Max Friedli, interim head of the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (Bazl), to the media yesterday.However, the Bazl does not yet comment on the content of the new operating regulations of the airport.
In plain language: By mid -March, the application in Bern will be checked, then only published in the wording and published for 30 days (until around the end of April, because the Easter holidays are still in between).The cantons' hearing started yesterday.The regulations are to be put into force in February 2005. OB The operating regulations are approved, according to Bazl lawyer and project manager Adrian Uti.
If it is approved, the cantons, communities and residents of the court path are free up to the Federal Supreme Court.Beschi could not yet say whether any objections would have the suspensive effect.An interim regimax Friedli emphasized that it was a temporary operating regulations.
With regard to a definitive regulations that can only be tackled "only after mediation", this "transitional regime" does not have a prejudicial effect.This regulations should be valid for the duration of mediation.The Bazl hopes that this will come about.
The Bazl knew nothing of a temporal tightening of the German approach barriers, with which Germany wants to push the number of approaches to 80,000 a year.Airspace from Basel to St. Gallenine Third premise is also certain for the Bazl: Air traffic control expert Markus Luginbühl considers it unlikely that Germany will also request the third waiting room to be relocated to the German area (Holding Rilax via Donaueschingen).South German aircraft noise opponents work on this.
What is certain is that the relocation of the waiting rooms from Laufenburg to the Fricktal and from Singen on the Thurgau naval movements makes a reorganization of the entire Swiss airspace necessary.The traffic district, controlled by Zurich air traffic controller, is to extend from Basel to St. Gallen in the future.This also affects private flying.

Dispute over airport operating rules / / In the provisional operating regulations for Zurich Airport, the starts are temporarily adjusted to the south for security reasons.This is not the only reason why the airport operators are heavily criticized.
Kloten.Max Friedli had taken the long way from Bern to Kloten.But the interim chief of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) could not report much new.
It has been known for months that the new operating regulations for the airport should essentially continue to continue the current state.However, Stefan Hotzfriedli showed how tricky the situation is.Actually, the airport was supposed to present a draft regulations in 2000 before the new airport owner Unique was to receive the concession for the company.
The termination of the agreement on northern flights by Germany and the grounding of Swissair made this impossible.The restrictions by Berlin after the failure of the state treaty and the discrepancies of the noise distribution have since made several provisional changes necessary.The new operating regulations, the draft of which was presented yesterday, only applies to the time:
For one to four years, as long as the mediation planned for noise issues lasts.According to the design, in the future, in the future, the north will continue to land: during the German blocking times from the south, in the evening from the east.Starts take place to the west and south as before.
A night flight lock from 11 p.m. (in the event of delays from 11:30 p.m.) until 6 a.m.Local residents criticized yesterday that only one Swiss flight to Tel Aviv was affected by this change.In return, Unique wants to cancel restrictions on starts, i.e. in the morning from 6 a.m. (today 7 a.m.) to the west, in the evening until 10 p.m. (now 9 p.m.).
Larger curve after the start of the Teufel is in one point that is more than just one detail.Immediately after a start to the south, a sharp curve to the left (“Left Turn”) is on the Opfikon and Kloten regulation.This can lead to a collision course with an airplane that wanted to land north, but has to get started, as a recently known Fast Collection shows last August.
In the event of poor visibility and high traffic volume - this corresponds to about a third of the operating time or around 30 starts per day - an extended left -wing bend (“Wide Left Turn”) is now to be introduced in order to avoid dangerous approaches.This new departure variant leads via Zurich-Schwamendingen, Dübendorf and Illnau-Effretikon.Starting through Dübendorf airfield is no problem, the experts assured.
Air traffic must already be coordinated with the military today.There are also considerations of the Air Force to deduct the fighter jets from Dübendorf from next year.It would be a bitter pill for the population in the Glattal if this relief would be "compensated for" by more noise from Kloten. Beginning of an agreement between Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger and the German Transport Minister Manfred Stolpe, two waiting rooms near February 2005 would have to be moved to Swiss airspace.
The waiting room Ekrit is new to lie over the upper Fricktal, Saffa into the area between Kreuzlingen and Weinfelden.Due to the necessary adaptation of the airspace structure, the waiting room Rapex at the Upper Zurichsee also shifts into the Hochybrig area (see graphic). The application for the new operating regulations will be publicly published in March and published in the wording.All pending recuries against the previous regulations are adopted, so they remain valid.
The Bazl wants to decide in November whether it approved the operating regulations.It must come into force due to the requirements from Germany until February 2005.The much -discussed curved northern approach only through Swiss airspace is not the subject of this procedure.
However, the proposal should be clarified so that it can flow into the mediation process.For the time being, the responsible air traffic control skyguide was fully concerned with the necessary changes in airspace, said Bazl boss Max Friedli.Josef Felder, CEO von Unique, reacted to the airport operator's credibility problem yesterday.
In fact, Zurich Airport has not been able to calm down since 2000.There is no clear political leadership.No other company operates in such an intercontinental manner and will be “conformed” in terms of local politics, complained Felder:
"The airport has a 55-year history, we have a license until 2051. It would be wrong to get out of step through the daily hectic pace." To the south.Starts and landings should not only take place in the future.
The waiting rooms are also postponed from Germany to Switzerland.A waiting room is likely to be over the upper Fricktal.Protests in Zurich-North Zurich.
NZ.The city of Zurich and the neighboring communities immediately protested the new departure process against south yesterday.The procedure of the airport is "arrogant, cynical and stupid," said Zurich health head Robert Neukomm (SP):
Before the planned mediation has started, there is already a new concept.The northern quarters, especially Schwamendingen, would be twice stressed by the “Wide Left Turn” and starting until 10 p.m. in addition to the new southern flights in the early morning.The “Zurich-Nord against Aircraft noise” resident association has already carried out a protest meeting at the airport.
"Klammlich" attempts to smuggle a change in the flight regime, which cannot be justified with the limits by Germany, but only with the endeavor to increase the capacity of the airport. "Basel benefits in the medium term" Basel.Ssch.The EuroAirport has not felt anything from the new flight regime in Zurich, says EuroAirport director Jürg Rämi to the BAZ.There were no evasive landings.
In the medium term, however, the delay situation could result in relocations to Basel, Rämi estimates.For example, the low-cost airline Easyjet has already painted two connections from Zurich and instead flies from the end of March Basel-London / Stansted and from May to Berlin / Schönefeld.However, for Easyjet, the high fees in Zurich were particularly decisive for the move.
Other so-called “Lowcost” airlines such as Air Berlin are also anything but built on Zurich Airport."Zurich is not a destination for a lowcost carrier," said Easyjet Switzerland's head last Friday at a media conference in Basel.On the other hand, the Swiss cannot move away from Zurich, since its connection concept is fully aligned with Kloten.
Individual flights cannot simply be "outsourced" to Geneva or Basel because they generate connecting traffic in Zurich.In addition, the aircraft booths are coordinated."The delay situation between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. is full," media spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel told BAZ.
The resulting damage is currently not quantifiable.What is certain is that delays damage the reputation of an airport.Passengers who have to switch to long -haul flights, for example, to long -haul flights, are likely to use other competitors such as converters such as Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London or Paris.
A network lives in advance from the transfer quality, and punctual flights are crucial.There are also delays in themselves that they spread across the network.On the one hand, because the planes return late, on the other hand because delayed connection passengers have to be constantly waited for.

The discovery of security / / from Lukas Häß ·
A lot has been risked at Zurich Airport for years.In retrospect, it is incomprehensible how long those responsible did nothing to make a latently threatening collapse of two jets over Valaisellen.This was conceivable when a normally starting plane flew its regular left curve to the south and at the same time a jet landing from behind had to suddenly had to start over the slopes.
In the extension, one would have met what the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (Bazl) prompted to request safety distances between the individual machines in December.Until then, the bosses of the Skyguide air traffic control, Swiss, Flughafen AG and politics were mere cosmetic measures, even though the risk has long been known.At least the specialists under the leadership of the Skyguide air traffic control checked a first solution in early 2000.
The trigger: two planes had come dangerously close after a starting maneuver, once in 1997, again in 1998. The scattered skyguide pilots suggested a changed departure process.The jets starting on the long slope 16 should fly your left curve, which you initiate shortly after lifting, a little less sharply.
This would increase faster and make enough space among themselves for a jet that started in any way.Skyguide presented the plan of the supervisor in Bern, the Bazl.However, the office referred to the Zurich government council, which must give his blessing for changes in the flight routes with appropriate noise pollution.
There you waved off.The newly elected economy director Ruedi Jeker felt no desire for even more noise opponents in his early days as the top airport politician.The wishes of the Swissair went to the BAZL.
However, this was only true in bad weather.If the sky was clear, in the case of so -called visual flight weather, it remained with the previous dangerously short separations between the machines.This was justified with the growth of air traffic and the impending delays.
That would have been the topic off the table.If there had been an almost disaster again last August.In contrast to the two earlier cases, the captain of the Swiss-Embraer started this time created a report.
He reported a Near Miss with a Boeing 737 Easyjet, which had to stop the landing at the last moment and flew on a collision course with full thrust instead of turning off.The BAZL supervisory center Orders based on an interim report by the BFU flight accident office that the larger distances should be observed even in visual flight weather.Finally, the right teaching was drawn from the various almost crashs.
On the one hand, this shows that the Bern supervisory authorities perceive their responsibility today according to the lost trust.On the other hand, the sobering conclusion that in Kloten security only enjoyed the top priority in Kloten.For a long time, the wishes of the home company Swissair had priority.
The then Swissair boss Philippe Bruggisser had concentrated all intercontinental flights in Zurich Kloten from 1995 in the course of his expansion strategy.In order to fill the big jets with enough passengers, it took more and more feeder flights from Europe.Politics and airport authorities offered a hand for solution and allowed additional starts to the south.
In 1994 there were still around 14,000 such starts on slopes 16, their number rose to around 37,000 by 2000. In its growth plans, Zurich Airport also expected 90,000 starts to south by 2010.Alternative variants were missing.
If the small jets had started to the west as before, the volume of traffic would not have been mastered.How efficient this system is - landing exclusively from the north on slopes 14, starting only on slopes 16 to the south - a hardest test in summer 2000. In the course of the construction of the Dock Midfield, the western slope 28 remained closed for three months.
The entire traffic could be mastered without any problems.And this despite the fact that in 2000 with 326,000 flight movements so many jets ended up in Zurich and started than ever before.However, this was only possible because the planes were allowed to fly in all directions after the start.
The capacity is now between ten and twelve in the morning at a good 50 flight movements, almost 20 less than before.This makes you far away from the desired 90, which, according to specialists, would be necessary for a delay-free hub in the future.And even with the safety measure imposed by the Bazl, a collision in the air is not completely excluded.
That is why the airport applied for the left curve to fly again this week in a larger arc.One expects objections to the Federal Supreme Court.Image: Martin Ruetschi (Keystone) Congratulations not excluded:

“Ingrown for the airport” / / unique boss Josef Felder explains who has to pay for the costs of delays.Marcel Odermatherr Felder spoke to Josef Felder *, for security reasons, the airport's capacities were restricted during the main traffic.
What does that mean for unique?The larger separation of the flights required by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation - especially in the traffic -intensive time from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. - to a reduction in capacity of around 21 percent.However, this does not mean that these flights are eliminated.
It means that during this time there are delays that are intolerable for both the airport, the airlines and passengers.Kloten is already a European champion in terms of delays.There are a number of reasons for the number of delays.
We are dissatisfied with the current situation.It is bad for the airport.We have already made a lot of efforts to improve the situation.
Delays cost especially money.The Swiss alone speaks of five million francs.Who has to pay for the damage ?
The flight companies in particular bear the follow -up costs of delays.For us as an airport operator, they primarily mean additional pollution.The airports are in a tough competition.
The recent capacity restrictions make Kloten less attractive to potential customers.Capacity restrictions certainly do not have a sales -promoting effect.The restrictions due to the larger separation of the flights primarily affects our home airline Swiss.
Unique does everything possible to continuously improve the delay situation.How do delays and capacity reduction affect Unique's economic situation?We will only inform about our financial result at our balance sheet media conference on March 4, 2004.
Yesterday they themselves limited the number of flight movements on 350,000 flight movements.In 2003 there were 270,000. Where should the additional 80,000 starts and landings come from?
We have not given ourselves a plan.The 350,000 movements are what should be processed with today's slopes and operating system if the demand is accordingly.The capacity of today's airport systems is sufficient for the expected traffic development in the medium term.
The airport has no longer a backing - neither in politics nor among the population.Can an airport be operated against the population and politics?We do not want to and cannot operate the airport against the Swiss population or against politics.
We hope that the insight for what an airport needs and who is responsible for what, through an objectification, also in the media, leads to another relationship with the Swiss gate to the world.The population around the airport is unsettled.We understand that.
However, we still feel a backing from the population beyond the airport region.* Josef Felder has been head of the airport operator Unique since the end of March 2000.

Fast collision in the air / / Basel.- A dangerous approach between a machine from the Dutch KLM and an Airbus A-330 The Swiss via France has assumed lightly.
The Swiss flight LX 17 from New York to Zurich was around 7.45 a.m. with 137 passengers and 11 crew members near Reims when the on-board warning system showed the proximity of another transport aircraft.The Swiss crew followed the instruction of the warning system and thus moved away from the KLM machine.According to Swiss, it is currently being examined why a collision would have occurred.
At the distance from the two machines, Swiss spokesman Dominique Werner could not say for the time being.It was also open whether there was a connection with an air traffic controller strike on the Paris airports, but was judged to be unlikely at Swiss.(AP)

A bad joke / / W. E. «Further turbulence and changes can also be expected in the airline industry in 2004.Thanks to the slow economic upswing, we gain flight altitude every day and look forward to small interim successes that give us the strength to fly our goal with optimism.
»We read these sentences by the Swiss chairman André Dosé on board a Jumbolino Avro RJ 85/100 in the Inflight magazine with the promising addition“ Travel in Style ”.And we have been waiting for almost half an hour to “win the flight of flight” before the Captain comes up, the departure is delayed by 5 to 10 minutes due to the de -icing.It actually snowed slightly.
Then again at 11 a.m. news from the cockpit: The liquid had ended in Zurich Airport to undo the wings.A bad joke?
It is not even in mid -February...The hostess calms the business class passengers with a glass champagne, and exactly one hour after the scheduled start time, the aircraft still rolls to the ducks of the SR Technics.Instead of at 10:15 p.m., we finally get up at 11 a.m. 40, instead of shortly before 12 p.m. we meet our partners at 1 p.m. in the Center d'Affaires in Nice Airport.
The return flight is already at 5 p.m. 45 - the lost hour is missing.And the explanation from the airport operator Unique: Probably a annoyed pilot who had to wait a bit.Many long -distance jets start at this time.

Even fewer flights in January / / Kloten.- The number of starts and landings at Zurich Airport continues.
In January, according to its own statistics, Unique registered almost 20,000 arrival and departure that were completed according to instrument flight rules - the flight category that it continues to be statistically recorded at www.Uniqueairport.com.These numbers correspond, for example, to the movements of commercial traffic.That was a good 1900 or 8.7 percent fewer flight movements than in January 2003.
According to Unique, line traffic decreased by 11.6 percent, charter traffic by 9.4 percent.This decline was somewhat cushioned by an increase of 21.3 percent in private air traffic, which was due to the World Economic Forum.In the first half of February, the downward trend stated:
Unique counted 933 or 8.7 percent instrument flight movements less than in the comparison weeks of the previous year.In 2003, Unique had a total of 269,000 movements - around 13,000 or 4.5 percent less than in 2002. The numbers of the traditionally weak month of January do not consider unique to be meaningful enough to derive a trend for the whole year.The decline since the beginning of the year has been due to the fleet and route reduction of the Swiss since the beginning of the year, which had slimmed down by 22 aircraft last year and painted around 20 destinations on the winter flight schedule.
Sometimes other airlines have jumped into the gaps for the absence of the Swiss European connections, and it is a problem with the thinned long -distance network.Booked is now an united airlines flight to Washington from June.Unique announces changes in the summer flight schedule (from Sunday, March 28th) in March.

Swiss and KLM have come dangerously close / / Basel.Ap.
A dangerous approach between a machine from the Dutch KLM and an Airbus A-330 The Swiss via France died lightly yesterday Wednesday morning.Thanks to the reaction of the crews and thanks to the built -in warning systems, the incident at Reims has remained without consequences, the Swiss said.The Swiss flight LX 17 from New York to Zurich was around 7.45 a.m. with 137 passengers and eleven crew members near Reims when the on-board warning system showed the proximity of another transport aircraft.
The Swiss crew followed the instruction of the warning system and thus moved away from the KLM machine.The incident was reported according to the prescription.It is examined why there was a rapprochement.

Airport closure and holiday dreams / / New operating regulations for Zurich-Kloten Airport, TA from 17th, 18th and 19th 2. Not always I agree to the airport problem with the reports and comments of the TA.I found the comment by Erwin Haas (“Flugärärm - now for everyone”, February 18).
I can't really come away from the idea yet, the German restrictions were just right to finally get the flexibility via operating regulations, to land or start in all directions.The south is “cracked” and the growth problem is solved.But somehow everything makes a chaotic impression.
I agree with the TA commentator that the flight path regime presented has no chance of democratically supported realization.I would expect a first signal from the Zurich government council.We are no longer allowed to tolerate that a government council as the elected politician chats according to the mood of the people and supports the opposite direction as VR from Unique.
David Strebel, Hinteregg with the new operating regulations, the airport has not triggered any joy.Nobody wants aircraft noise, and if so, the others should have it.So what to do?
I propose as an as a consequence of all these demands to close the airport and use it again.The wetlands or wet locations are expanded and explained by national meaning into protected areas.The green areas can be converted into golf courses, and the slopes and roller paths could be suitable for understimated conditions and corresponding adjustments for a Formula 1 racing route.
There are also other uses for the buildings.So, we tackle it, the faster, the better.But please not before autumn;
I would like to go on vacation with the plane!Dagobert Stampfli, Rümlangauf The first glance it is clear that the south of the airport in particular is one of the losers when the new operating regulations are implemented.But if you expand your gaze, you quickly find out that the new operating regulations with the “Wide Left Turn” create several thousand new sympathizers through the Belärmen of Dübendorf, Wangen, Effretikon, Illnau, Weisslingen, Tösstal, which in civil organizations against the arrogant airport operatorswill fight.
Soon we will experience demonstrations with 20,000 instead of 10,000 participants.Thomas Koch, Winterbergwann Finally our politicians and the BAZL realize that there is no space for emergency landings at the airport?There is neither plenty of arable land (as in Munich) nor forest (as with Bassersdorf), but only densely inhabited settlement area.
That is why southern flights are a time bomb!Of course, the Federal Councilor Leuenberger and the Bazl know very well.And that is exactly the incredible one:
You know it and yet don't do anything about it.And if you protest against southern trips, you are simply referred to as unsolidaric gold coast bonds, as if Schwamendingen, Glattbrugg, Dübendorf, Gockhausen were on the gold coast.E. Kehrli, Egglaut
SVP is the Uvek absolutely without any leadership.In parliament and cantonal council, the People's Party is screaming loudly for saving.This savings craze means that, among other things, the airfare department has too few staff.
And now these super strategists frighten and are looking for a culprit!In all the misery around the airport, the SVP is in blame towards the left.We owe the whole thing to the bourgeois.
Since Blocher gave the wheel out of his hand, the monkey has been going on at the SVP.The party donents already see rats.In short, there is a bare chaos.
If that won't be the laugh number of the summer!Peter Birri, Buchsjede day we are shocked with horror reports on air traffic.The aircraft trigger folk -linking tirades and protest storms.
We look at the noisy thunder birds and wipe the emission dirt from the garden table every week.But as soon as the holiday season has come - see there: Maledives, Bali, Cuba!- From anywhere, holiday greetings flutter to those who stayed at home.
Of the title pages of the illustrated, couples beam at us from their love holidays in front of a turquoise sea.Who doesn't want to experience that too?But that is certainly not possible in Oerlikon or Regensdorf!
We lose our loyalty very quickly if we can use the air path for the allegedly most beautiful days of the year and escape the gray everyday life under the smog blanket.The immensely expensive price of latent risk of crash is worth our bargain mobility freedom!Anita Hürlimann, Rümlang

Surprised by the harsh reactions / / The airport managers are again very criticized after the presentation of the application for a temporary operating regulations.In conversation, unique administrative council president Andreas Schmid and CEO Josef Felder comment on the allegations and comment on possible strategies for setting up the conflict and the problem of delays.
Adrian Krebs and Matthias Saxer asked the questions.As the operator of a “shopping center”, Unique is certainly enjoying the delays, passengers have more time to spend money.Josef Felder: We are primarily an airport and not at all satisfied with the current situation of delays.
The causes are very deep.We start delays every day.Through the German Ordinance, we have a reduced capacity in the morning, which leads to follow -up delays.
But we still have a lot of homework to solve at the airport.Which ?Felder: After the grounding of the Swissair, a vacuum was created when linking the various partners at the airport, and we have to fill it as an operator.
We opened the so-called “airport steering” in October 2003.This control instrument summarizes all partners to optimally design coordination and communication.Is there a conflict between security and avoiding delays?
Andreas Schmid: This conflict exists, but it is bindingly solved for us.Security is always a top priority.Isn't the main reason for the delays of the extreme savings pressure, for example during security controls?
Schmid: Saving has nothing to do with the delays directly.In the case of security control, the 2003 means of funds was reduced by only 10 percent, but the number of passengers decreased by 30 percent.Do the longer distances to the Dock E have nothing to do with it?
Fields: The paths have become shorter for the aircraft.After completing the construction work at the Airside Center, the paths will be shorter and more comfortable for the passengers.Dismay
Larger than adopted, a new operating regulations have presented this week, the reactions were majority negative, are they surprised?Schmid: We learned to deal with these reactions.It is surprising to us how harsh you could do and that you were negative around the airport.
The reason is that because of the German Ordinance we have to Belärm the population around the airport.The negative rections hit us in that we do not want to introduce anything through the back door, but want to create transparency.The regulations are a compromise between the interests of the population and the economy or the demand for traffic.
The Zurich city council is represented on the Unique Board of Directors.City Councilor Neukomm has reacted particularly violently.Was Mayor Ledergerber overruled the Unique Board of Directors?
Schmid: I cannot and does not want to announce internals from the board of directors.It is understandable that the city of Zurich vehemently defends itself against southern trips.However, it is very strange with which negative vehemence ("arrogant, cynical, stupid", ed.)
City Councilor Robert Neukomm has reacted.They always emphasize that the airport cannot be operated against the majority of the population.Do you still have the majority behind you?
Schmid: The concern is far greater and wider today.At the present time we would not receive a majority of the Zurich population in a vote.This is the result that we fly “politically” today and not as it would make sense in terms of operational and settlement.
Many critics require a plan of flight movements, do you think of such a step to calm the situation?Schmid: You will not find any majorities with plans.
The question is: «Distribution or concentrating aircraft noise?».Since the beginning of the discussion, we have been clear for a northern orientation of flight operations.
Then why is the cranked northern approach in the new operating regulations missing?Felder: For us, the cranked northern approach is the alternative to the additional eastern flights and the new southern trips.We cannot include anything in the new operating regulations that have not been checked.
And this test is the responsibility of the air traffic control Skyguide and the Federal Office for Civil Aviation.Schmid: The Federal Council promised in October 2003 that it wanted to drive the cranked north approach, so that it can be brought into the mediation process as an alternative.Skyguide acts at the national level, but the airport is largely controlled by the cantonal government.
You don't hear anything from this at the moment.Do you feel abandoned by politics?Schmid: We feel the support of the government council and do not feel abandoned by him.
Financial compensation does not become southern flights through the installation of the instrument landing system (ILS) on slopes 34?Felder: Yes, that's correct, by gradually commissioning the ILS to slopes 34 there are more approaches in the morning and evening, but in the same time window as before.If the ILS is put into operation on slopes 28 in October 2005, there is a partially relocation to the eastern anflight.
The high proportion of transit passengers is often criticized.Felder: We have no fixed idea where it should be.In 2003 it was 34 percent and thus significantly lower than in Swissair times, in 2000 it was at a level of 44 percent.
Did Unique familiarize its own experts too much in the contest of the state contract before the administrative court in Mannheim?Felder: We have hired a globally recognized, renowned law firm and are well advised.Schmid: We are legally advised, but we have to increase our political and communicative sensitivity.
Who will advise you politically?Schmid: We want to learn from mistakes made and have therefore decided to set up a separate specialist office for political questions within the company in order to be better and more informed about the state of politics.We cannot solve the problem of immissions legally, but only politically.
And here we have made mistakes in the past.We were rightly told that we were too little sensitive in many political areas, and we want to improve this sensitivity.Felder: The task of the head of specialist Stefan Aeschimann, who previously worked for Minister of Transport Ogi, is to pursue the business of the Cantonal Council as well as the National and State Council and show us where we need to act.
Can't this task be performed by politicians on the unique board of directors?Schmid: The company does not always have an interest identity with the city and / or the canton.That is why we want to speak here with the clear language of the company.
Do you also want to better integrate the southern German population and the neighboring cantons?Schmid: Today we have to integrate the population around the airport.The dismay has greatly enlarged with the introduction of southern approach.
We are looking for the integration of southern Germany formally and informally.The German side is very skeptical about participation in the upcoming mediation process.What would happen if the main affected person could not be integrated?
Schmid: If you didn't take part, it would be very, very, very difficult to implement a definitive operating regulations.Could the German neighbors also compensate for the aircraft noise suffered financially?Schmid:
With financial compensation alone, we certainly cannot solve the problems.Mutual trust is badly disturbed, you can't just restore that with money.The mediation process is more suitable for this.
Only afterwards you have to talk about compensation questions.New flights to Washington and Dauhakönnt Unique without further examining the Swiss?Felder: If we want to remain an intercontinental turntable, we need an airline that guarantees the linking of the short, medium and long-haul flights with Zurich.
That can't just replace anyone.Our concern is to offer the Swiss population and the economy as many direct connections as possible.50 percent could be replaced in Europe.
In June, the connection to Washington will be resumed by United Airlines, and Katar Airways will now offer a connection to Dauha.Every flight from and to Zurich strengthens the importance of the Zurich turnstile and thus also the Swiss.What is the current part of Swiss in sales and flight movements?
Felder: SWISS generates 25 percent in the income, and it is 56 percent of the flight movements.Can you say something about the operating result of Unique in 2003? Schmid: No, only so much: Management and employees did a good job in an economically and operational difficult environment.

A plane redirected on the way to Morocco / / Washington, February 20.(AP)
A Moroccan passenger plane was redirected back to the USA on Thursday on the way from New York to Casablanca.There were contradictory information about the cause of the reversal.The machine continued its flight on Friday.
The traffic safety agency said early Friday morning that the reason for the diversion was a bomb threat.A spokeswoman for the air traffic authority, on the other hand, said that nothing was known about a threat.The Royal Air Maroc machine was redirected because a person on board had a security risk.
The Boeing 747 with 81 passengers and 10 crew members had been in the air for about two hours at that time.She had landed safely at Bangor Airport in Maine.A spokesman for the Federal Police FBI later said that a 27 -year -old passenger had remained in Bangor.
A private investigator in Chicago said that the man was an investment banker who had been missing since Saturday who called his family out of the plane.The man told his wife that he was captured by the Al Qaeda terror network and had to carry out one order for this.He then switched on the FBI.

Tired gladiators / / ark.According to the arena, new knowledge on SF DRS is rarely recorded.The political discussion forum is known in the Friday evening program for committed clashes without fear of personal attacks.
The topic of airport and national air traffic policy seemed predestined yesterday for a particularly controversial edition - even the security dispositive in the studio was above average.The illustrious field of participants was consistently tame, they were largely limited to well -known positions.A little louder, the discussion was only twice:
The first time when Federal Councilor Leuenberger and Airport Director fought over the extent of the southern flights under the rejected state treaty, the second time, as a SP national councilor Jacqueline Fehr (Zurich), read the Levites to the SVP representative Ueli Maurer and Rolf Siegenthaler.On the one hand, it is dishonest to reject the federal participation to Swiss and, on the other hand, to emphasize the economic importance of the airport.Minister of Transport Leuenberger concluded that he was pleased that all participants demanded a sustainable airport, which at the same time can fulfill an important infrastructure function for the Swiss economy and respects the needs of the population.
This is two contradicting goals;However, he hoped that they could be brought under one roof as part of the mediation process.Peter Staub, President of the Protection Association for the Population, contradicted this: the airport had not yet moved a millimeter to the population, he criticized.
Swiss boss André Dosé said that there was no unlimited growth.The airline has reduced its aircraft stock from originally 157 to 81 machines.Dosé complained about the delays at the airport and the high costs for air traffic control and security controls.

End radio silence / / by Hans-Peter Bierivom Airport Zurich Nothing new: Airport wants everything it can have.Despite German arrival restrictions, he demands that it can grow to the company capacity limits.
He wants air and noise sovereignty over even more spaces and even more people.Of the airport residents also the expected: horrible, anger, protest.And the usual of the authorities: radio silence.
Unique presented her ideas about the flight regime of the next few years on Wednesday, and the public frightened like the rabbit in front of the line.Those affected see themselves more and more at the mercy of a process of changing or stopping them less and less.They feel abandoned by the authorities:
Economic director Rita Fuhrer had nothing to say to them, Aviation Minister Moritz Leuenberger did not even send his PR woman.Unique, the impression of the population, can create facts at will.Politics dive.
A dangerous mood.The upcoming mediation process, which the federal and canton is so much hope on, has not created a spirit of optimism, but has increased distrust.You hardly expect more than a bad compromise.
And politics, one suspects, only gives itself an opportunity to do nothing and let things run their course.It is time that politics awakens from their sleeping beauty.If the mood around the airport is not to explode, a perspective must be opened to people, one that is not only dictated by the airport and the Swiss.
It needs a perspective beyond the mediation process.It takes an aviation policy that deserves this name.Actually, only a small step would be necessary:
Politics must finally understand aviation as what it is, namely as part of public transport.In reality, she has long since taken this step.With the billions for Swiss, Switzerland tacitly recognized that aviation is a public task.
But apparently it is infinitely difficult to understand this step in the head.In any case, after its Swiss Effort, political Switzerland quickly dipped back into aerial policy lethargy.The change of perspective would have followed.
According to today's reading, the aviation is a matter for the private sector: the Swiss is a private company (which was equipped with public funds), also the airport (even if it mainly belongs to the public sector).The task of the economy is growth and maximization of profits, task of the state to offer it the necessary framework conditions.
On the other hand, if you see the aviation as part of public transport, the accents shift.The task of public transport, whether it is perceived by private or the state, is to meet the need, its goal is the most favorable cost-benefit ratio for the economy.With this approach, the question immediately arises as to how big an airport must be in order to fulfill its economic task.
The population becomes a weighty position in the economic cost accounting.And for short journeys, rail connections become a real alternative because all costs are expected.The federal government in particular would have enough influence.
The airport confession offers handling, planning, environmental protection, security.Neither directistic nor planned economic regulations are needed.Politics simply have to set the framework conditions so that the development is in its sense.
And nothing prevents the canton from using its shareholder power at the airport in such a way that it is limited to the economically optimal size.Finally, the airport was not privatized at the time in order to make as much profit as possible, but so that it can better react to market needs.The federal government and the canton must finally fully perceive their economic and political responsibility.

British Airways in a descent / / After the worst worries about oil prices have subsided, British Airways must prepare for a break -in of demand.To the recession strategy of CEO
Willie Walsh includes a strong equity ceiling and a capacity reduction.sev.London, early January british Airways (BA), is strategically geared towards economically harder times.The British airline has reduced its capacity by 3 % in the current winter half year, and in summer the flight program is to be reduced by 1 %.
This appears little in view of the severity of the economic break -in;However, it should be sufficient for the time being, especially since the airline does not want to lose any market shares.BA therefore looks very closely at which routes cuts are carried out.
The problems of the financial sector are also noticeable in air traffic between the UK and Switzerland, whereby the volume has so far declined by 10 % so far.Financial reserves bring security for CEO
Willie Walsh is currently a thick cash pad and a strong balance sheet, as he emphasizes in a media discussion in London.The airline has £ 1.8 billion in cash reserves.BA also secured the financing of all newly ordered aircraft by 2012.
That is a big difference to other airlines.Those would have to fall back on their cash stocks, provided that they do not receive any new loans from or before delivery of new machines, said Walsh.The BA CEO has learned how decisive liquidity can be in its previous position as head of the Irish airline Aer Lingus.
When he took the helm there at the end of 2001 shortly after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the airline had no debt, but also no capital.In the financial predicament, Walsh had no choice but to push through a massive cost reduction program.Almost half of the 6000 employees lost their job.
In addition to capacity reduction and personnel reduction, the formation of other alliances or mergers is part of the “recession strategy”.Walsh believes that consolidation is part of the solution.The industry would benefit from this, he explained in London.
However, he has not been lucky with fusion negotiations lately.Shortly before Christmas, talks burst with the Australian Qantas.In one fell swoop, BA would have transformed a merger into a transcontinental carrier, but many financial analysts had not seen any major advantages, especially for Qantas.
Furthermore, the planned cooperation with American Airlines has also suffered a damper.The US Transport Ministry had requested additional information a few days ago;This signals skepticism from the US authorities.
After all, Iberia remains.But even though the talks have been running since summer, no breakthrough has been achieved.One of the hurdles is the large pension fund deficit from BA and the agreement on the exchange ratio of the shares.
A deal with the Spaniards would be important for BA.Compared to Air France Klm and Lufthansa, the British have need to catch up on the external growth.Hedging has not paid off the strong value of the British pound is a double -edged matter for BA.
The deeper pound course gives the British better access to the European market.Conversely, the kerosene is now offset again in harder dollars.Walsh removes that the two effects almost equalize.
In the last half -year result, the change of exchange rate changes increased the costs by £ 121 million and the income of £ 128 million.As for the other airlines, the decline in the oil price for BA is a welcome relief.Of course, the cause of the decline in price is less gratifying.
The IATA industry organization estimates that the airlines in 2009 save $ 32 billion in fuel costs worldwide.However, due to the low economic activity, they miss sales of $ 35 billion.This means that a problem was basically replaced by a new problem, the bottom line is that there is no improvement.
The irony of fate wants the financially stronger airlines to benefit less from the decline in oil prices than the weaker carriers.The latter hardly had the resources to secure themselves against rising oil prices at the appointment market.You have saved costs for hedging, which subsequently proved to be unnecessary.
If the airlines had not secured themselves, the savings of the IATA would have been almost twice as high at $ 60 billion.The stronger airlines have just worsened their relative position twice: once they have unnecessarily spent money on the protection, and secondly, fewer providers are now out of the market.
This means that the capacity remains high and the competition is intensive.In this case, luck may not have been with the "stupid", but at least with the weaker.The loss of value from the pound prevents the British Airways from being able to benefit from the deeper fuel prices in the extent of its competition.

Child do not distribute with the bathroom / / If the municipalities would only demand a flight time reduction for the southern trips, this would be wise, appropriate and seemed sensible.Now you want to release the child with the bathroom and reduce the operating times of the EuroAirport by a full three hours a day.
This although the existing night flight regulation has proven itself for thirty years.The probable consequences of these additional restrictions are easy to measure: the basis for an economic operation of the regular traffic aircraft, which is still stationed at EuroAirport, would no longer be available.
This would make the remaining connection offered massively.The conspiracy of the crossair and its excellent operation of the region at the time would potentiate that existing passenger lines in question.If landings were generally no longer possible after 10 p.m., Amsterdam, London, Vienna or Hamburg could no longer return to the region in the evening.
This appears to me at Grotesk at the time when the Northwestern Switzerland region has set up a “Regio-Nachtnetz” and run individual tram and bus lines until three o'clock in the morning.The operating times of the Nonstop trains Zurich-Basel and vice versa were extended until 11 p.m. with the timetable change, and it was still possible at midnight to take the train to Basel.Should cadremates and others who live in Basel and the surrounding communities should no longer return to the region from their business trips by plane in the evening?

Air traffic is public transport / / letter to the editor: do not release the child with the bathroom;BAZ January 6, 09 The statements made by Willi Rehmann in his letter to the editor deserve not only the reader, but also those responsible for the EuroAirport (EAP) and the authorities.
It is not a matter of constantly demonizing air traffic because of its safe existing immissions.This traffic not only takes place for the pleasure of a few, but is part of our economic system and our lifestyle.I am always surprised that against the immissions of train traffic in the Neubadenkartier (confidently sections of the Alsässerbahn) or the predominantly private commuter traffic, for example in the village center of Allschwil, is not argued with the same vehemence as against the immissions of the starting and landing aircraft on the EAP.
It is obvious that the same elle is not measured here.Is there a basic urgeon attitude that impossible an objective perception of the actual noise pollution and its causes?Peter f. Peyer, Basel

Swiss 2008 with strong passenger growth / / "Cei. Frankfurt, 12.
Januardie Swiss transported 10 % more passengers last year than in 2007. She was able to completely discontinue the highly expanded offer and thus keep its utilization at a high level.So while the full year provides pleasant figures, the airline cannot escape the economic downturn in December.
This month, a little fewer passengers used the intercontinental offer than in December 2007. Until in October, Swiss had recorded double-digit growth rates on the intercontinental routes.The passengers are also more cost -conscious.
In any case, Swiss writes that the poorer capacity utilization in December has to do with the decline in the premium segment.Regardless of the weakening in December, the airline has shown an impressive performance over the past few years.The passenger volume has increased by 40 % within four years.
At the same time, the occupancy rate in Europe was significantly improved and kept at a high level in intercontinental transport.The owner of the Swiss, the German Lufthansa, also contributed to this success, which the Swiss daughter leaves scope for an independent development.Lufthansa itself (i.e. without Swiss) was unable to keep its utilization from the previous year in 2008.
The seat load factor dropped from 79.7 % to 78.6 %, the number of passengers rose slightly by 1.2 % to 57 million. Like the Swiss, Lufthansa also felt the weakening at the end of the year.However, while the Swiss promoted 6.6 % more passengers due to the increase in Europe in December than in the same month, the number of passengers at Lufthansa fell by 3.7 %.However, this losses are still light compared to the Scandinavian SAS group, which also published its traffic figures on Monday.
Their number of passengers decreased by 13 % in December.37.9 million (-3 %) people flew over the year with an airline of the SAS group, which also includes the Spanair, which is currently undergoing a corporate renovation.The occupancy rate in the SAS group was 70.6 % in 2008.

Still goodwill at the new US single regime / / Bern.- Since yesterday, new single -time rules have been in place for flight passengers with Destination USA.
An online questionnaire must be filled out by three days before departure.In a transition phase, however, the US authorities show a certain goodwill."Passengers who have forgotten to get the entry permit in good time can make up for this shortly before departure in the counter hall," said Swiss spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel.

(AP) US sanctions against nuclear smugglers.- The United States has imposed sanctions against companies and people who are said to have connections to the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, Abdul Quader Khan.Among them are a Swiss and a German who are said to have business with the Tinner family from St. Gallen.
On the one hand, the Swiss engineer Daniel Geige is on the list.In February 2008, he was sentenced to a probation in South Africa for 17 years after he had stood the nuclear smuggling.On the other hand, the German Gotthard Lerch, which was sentenced to five and a half years in prison for the nuclear smuggling, can be found on the other hand.

Shaving at the end of the year / / Kloten.Zurich Airport can record solid traffic growth in 2008 despite a weakening at the end of the year.
Compared to the previous year, the number of passengers increased by 6.6 percent from 20.7 million to 22.1 million, as can be read in a media release.The greatest absolute increase recorded Swiss with growth of 9.7 percent, followed by Air Berlin, Singapore Airlines and Easyjet.In December, the airport recorded growth of 0.2 percent.

The growth at the airport AB / / ARK.Zurich Airport had a growing number of passengers for the fourth time in a row last year.
According to a message from the Unique, a total of 22.1 million people traveled to or via Zurich in 2008.This corresponds to an increase of 6.6 percent (previous year 7.6 percent).The previous record number of 22.7 million in 2000 was narrowly missed.
However, growth was distributed unevenly.The rates are increasingly flattened towards the end of the year due to the economic situation.While over 10 percent were still increasing in the first quarter, this decreased to 0.2 percent in December.
The number of flight movements, which was seen by 2.4 percent (previous year 2.9 percent) to just under 275,000 all year round, decreased slightly in December.It dropped by a good 3 percent compared to the previous year.The growth of the passenger categories was also irregularly distributed.
The number of transfer passengers increased by 11 percent to 7.8 million.In contrast, the increase in local passengers was only 4.5 percent.As a result, the proportion of transfer passengers increased from 33.8 to 35.2 percent of the total volume.
The statistics from Unique also deal with the numbers for the individual airlines.The Swiss was able to record the greatest passenger growth with 9.7 percent, ahead of Air Berlin, Singapore Airlines and Easy Jet.The Swiss also swung up on the traffic.

Official representatives who take part in the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and reach Switzerland with a business travel frame can enter Dübendorf for the first time this year.Here you switch directly to a helicopter of the Air Force or are brought to Davos by sedan.According to the Federal Office for Police (Fedpol), these are people who represent a country and have the so -called international protection of the host country.
The Federal Safety Service determines which protective measures are necessary.The execution of the accompanying protection is delegated to the cantonal and city police.The Fedpol does not communicate in the run -up to the occasion for which the new possibility of switching to Dübendorf is used for obvious reasons.
The WEF is the biggest challenge for the federal security service every year.The cantonal police cope with the event with intercantonal operations.During the Euro 08, the federal government had already given a special permit for the handling of civil aircraft in Dübendorf.
However, this had not been used because the volume of traffic remained less than expected.Popular Standplate Connection with the WEF operates the Air Force from Dübendorf with helicopters for transports and PC-7 for surveillance flights.After the good experiences last year, the army again provides 10 to 15 stands for aircraft from private WEF participants at the military airfield.
These machines end up for loading and inviting at Zurich Airport and are transferred to Dübendorf for parking.The Air Force Center, in collaboration with Execujet, gets the handling of this civilian traffic and the handling on the ground in Dübendorf.The air traffic control is responsible for scheduling the floating.
A limited number of long-term stands are available at Zurich Airport.Private aircraft who have no stand must switch to a different airfield for parking.The airport company expects a comparable, possibly higher traffic volume to business aircraft than last year's WEF.

A journey through time to the future of air traffic / / met.Finnair did not celebrate the reasonably “round” 85th birthday with a commemorative publication with which long history of the airline is to be looked back in international comparison.On the contrary, Finland's airline takes a look into the future.
In a very distance, because the anniversary book is entitled “Departure 2093 - Five Visions of Future Flying”.The “www.darture2093.com” website has been set up at the same time.There, interested parties with experts can discuss the future of flying online, present their own visions and also admire hypothetical aircraft of the future in the picture.
Of course, 85 years are simply not an overview of an overview.In this respect, the project also has a GAG character.But as authors, a number of serious specialists from the areas of future research, environmental sciences, aircraft construction and airline industry have been won.
Essential long-term vision pascal Huet, Vice President at Airbus and responsible for market strategy and forecasts, justifies why a company such as its long-term visions are important for a company.“Today we are still flying on aircraft that were developed in the early 1960s and who can continue to be operated for 15 years.
The A380, which has just become fledged, was designed, for example, around the turn of the millennium.It should now be built for 30 to 40 years.And the last plane delivered will then be at least 30 years.
So we can speak of cycles from 70 to 80 years per aircraft development.Long -term progress is essential.»Nobody could have an overview of 85 years.
But based on previous trends, it can be said that the volume of air traffic doubles every 15 years.Also, a much greater growth has been determined in tourist traffic since the 1970s than in business travel traffic.The trend is likely to strengthen, writes Huet.
Depending on the purpose of the travel, it predicts very different aircraft in the future: the return of the overs sound aircraft, which, flying over the atmosphere, reaches Australia in two to three hours.On the other hand, the cruise ship in airspace with tourists on board, which enjoy the trip and the sightseeing from the air.Atte Korhola, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Helsinki, is convinced that at the end of the century the kerosene will be replaced by alternative fuels.
Biotic fuels would one day produce much more cheaper and more environmentally friendly than today, for example with bacteria and seaweed.The latter could double their biomass several times a day;The yield will be at least 15 times higher than on the same size using plants such as rapeseed, oil palm or soy.
And one day the plane will no longer have traditional wings, Korhola predicts.The wing becomes a fuselage - with the result of higher buoyancy and lower air resistance, which will significantly reduce fuel consumption.Desired dreamer trainer von-Wrede, chief environmental engineering at Airbus, recalls that the air traffic industry had set itself the goal of operating with zero CO 2 emissions by 2050.
«This is ambitious, but we will achieve the goal.»Paul Steele, director of environmental issues at the IATA airline roof association, recalls that fuel efficiency has increased by 70 percent in the past forty years.Another 25 percent improvement can be expected by 2020.
For the further future, Steele predicts a situation in which the production of biofuels and food will no longer compete.Algae farms would be created in desert zones and other areas that could not be used for conventional agriculture.- The 2093 vision of flying spreads expert knowledge, but it is also entertainment and, in terms of space, it is very easy for children's book in the style of the future believers 1960s.
Some reminds of the “spaceship Orion” of past TV times, other things want to bring the good old and cozy time back before the emergence of mass air traffic.The drawings of the future giant transporters already remind you to caution.Space on board aircraft will remain precious at the end of the century.
Even the comfort -conscious Finnair will not create this economic balancing act.Economic worries - and proud of the Grandfathermettler H. (Met) Met.Jukka Hienonen, CEO of the Finnair, likes the anniversary of his company.
Taking a look into the distant future of aviation is fascinating, he says in conversation.The industry needs visions.Hienonen's business, however, is not the hypothetical future of air traffic in many decades, but that, especially in these months, deeper and deeper into the crisis of the airlines.
The Finnair is also affected by the dramatic yields.If the company had still made a profit of 140 million euros in 2007, the operating result in the first half of 2008 halved from 33 million in the previous year to 16 million euros.And in the third quarter of 2008, the Finnair fell into the minus with a loss of 17 million euros.
The prospects continued to darken in the last quarter.Hienons now speaks of hard austerity measures.There will be cancellations, in the best case of around 9 percent, in the worst case up to a third of the good 100 destinations offered today could be affected.
In the long -distance network, Guangzhou (canton) was eliminated in 2009 will be difficult, also given the approximately 15 percent overcapacity in Europe, says Hienonen.Despite the dark clouds, the CEO sees the Finnair well positioned for the future.He sees a great chance in the Far East traffic that Finnair has forced in recent years.
With the 10 destinations in China and Japan every day, the company can take advantage of a weighty lead: the large circle distance from Helsinki compared to Central Europe.The Finnair copes with a single aircraft per day, while Lufthansa has to budget with 1.3 jets, for example.However, the Asian routes were recently confronted with earnings.
The earthquake in China left its mark, and the Olympic month was extremely disappointing in Beijing.Nevertheless, Hienonen expansion plans are inherited: With Japan, a new air traffic agreement has been completed that enables additional connections.
Wards were also causing a sensation that the CEO was given that one was interested in taking over a part of the long -haul routes of SAS.Finnair is one of the oldest airlines in the world still operating today in 1923, as Hienons notes with some pride.Alone, his grandfather, the airline could not serve - 1932 - at the time;
The flights to the United States were not recorded until 1969.According to Hienonen's description, the grandfather was an enthusiastic wrestler and participant in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.The excursion, return trip by train, steamer and, including the game including games, took five months at the time.
At the Atlantic crossing, the grandfather injured himself during training.The delegation manager, a certain urho Kekkonen, who was to become Finland President from 1956 to 1981, wanted to send him on home after arriving in New York.The athletes were paid for the tickets.

State representatives end up at the military airfield / / state guests during the World Economic Forum for the first time via the military airfield in Dübendorf to Switzerland.Dübendorf.
- This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) begins in Davos on January 28th.During the five -day event, the state representatives who reach Switzerland with their business aircraft from all over the world can enter the Dübendorf military airfield for the first time.This is written by the NZZ in its Thursday edition.
According to the Federal Office for Police (Fedpol), this applies exclusively to people who represent a country and enjoy the so -called international protection of the host country, in this case of Switzerland.From Dübendorf, the illustrious guests then reach Davos with a helicopter from the Swiss Air Force or by limousine.The prominence of business circles must continue to travel via Kloten Airport.
The extent to which the new change option is used does not communicate the Fedpol in the run -up to the event for security reasons.During the Euro 08, the federal government had already given a special permit for the handling of civil aircraft at the Dübendorf military airfield.According to the NZZ, however, this was not used at the time because the traffic was too low.
So far, the fourth largest city in the canton of Zurich has only played a major role in this year's WEF.Although the Air Force's missions for securing airspace via Davos were led from Dübendorf last year that state guests end up at the Dübendorf military airfield, but is a novelty.
During WEF 2008, the airfield only served as a parking lot for around ten private jets.The machines landed in Kloten for the handling of the customs formalities and were then transferred to Dübendorf.This is because the space available at Kloten Airport are limited and the planes had to be relocated to airfields in the neighboring countries in earlier years.

Terror threat, for example, as in previous years / / / the federal intelligence services, the security situation in the run -up to the World Economic Forum in the run -up to previous years.Abroad, they state a rather low mobilizer of the opponents of the major event starting in Davos next week.
The financial and economic crisis is a factor that could inspire rallies against the 39th World Economic Forum (WEF), which started next Wednesday.In general, however, the federal service for analysis and prevention (DAP) estimates the risks related to demonstrations about the same as in the previous year.The main call for the planned anti-WEF rally in Geneva, which the local authorities have not approved due to the lack of security forecasts by the organizers.
Abroad, says the interim DAP director Jürg Bühler, it is found that the mobilization power of the WEF opponents is "not very strong".The DAP also sees elaborate personal protection noticeable changes in the general terrorist threat.It is still important that Switzerland is not a priority goal for terrorist attacks.
Of course, the tense situation in the Middle East flows into the threat analysis - especially with regard to the fact that numerous exposed people are in the country during the WEF.There are currently no specific indications for a special threat from Davos.The air space lock and the willingness of the Air Force therefore have a pronounced preventive character.
The DAP emphasizes that the canton of Graubünden is fundamentally responsible for security in the area of the forum.Only when protecting the airspace, for which the federal government has the necessary funds exclusively, can the competence to be used to use weapons in the extreme case to the head of the defense department (VBS).There is also a federal responsibility with regard to people who are entitled to international protection.
This obligation is perceived by the Federal Office for Police and the Federal Security Service.43 heads of state and government have registered- more than ever.As every year, the DAP leads the national news association in favor of the cantonals and the federal authorities.
In specialist circles, the WEF is considered a so -called “hard target” (hard goal).The last experiences with attacks have shown that terrorists are not primarily interested in such “Hard Targets”.They have more targeted with soft destinations with numerous victims as possible - railway trains, train stations, hotels and so on that are more difficult to protect.
A maximum of 5000 military personnel in recent years Graubünden is supported by police forces from all cantons, Liechtenstein and the army.The number of military personnel used in the assistant service may be a maximum of 5000 according to a parliamentary decision that is valid for three years and now expiring;So far it has never been fully exhausted.
The military part of the security operation is managed by the management staff of the army in Bern.Its boss has been a divisionist Peter Stutz for two years.During WEF engagement, he is a “KSSE” commander of subsidiary security.
He is assumed by a commandant of the soil under the commander of the territorial region 3, divisional Roberto Fisch, a group of air (colonel in the Bernhard Müller General Staff), the logistics base of the army with responsibility also for the medical service and the management base of the army.Stutz also emphasizes the responsibility of the civilian authorities of Graubünden.
The Graubünden police commander Markus Reinhardt is overall operations manager.The mechanics of subsidiary missions such as in Davos have meanwhile been well, says St. Galler Peter Stutz, who, as a former commander of the territorial region, has been experienced in dealing with civilian authorities.It is to present the problem of which the solution overwhelms their own forces.
Together it is about determining the forces and medium requirements.The military side must always be able to say no to a subsidiary insert.In the case of the WEF, this is not an issue after the Federal Council in its message to the parliament has classified the event as an extraordinary event in the international interests of Switzerland.
A strict separation between professional personnel and militia applies to subsidian use.For personal protection and access controls, professional soldiers of military security, for the protection of important infrastructure facilities (such as traffic, electricity and water supply) are mainly used.The use of members of the army for order service orders is expressly excluded;
These are the responsibility of the police. 8 million francs cost from January 27 to February 2, an airspace lock with radius 46 kilometers around Davos (comparisons card).The Air Force operates its fighter jets this year, but keeps a second airfield willing to be prepared for any weather situation.Austria's Air Force is also involved in the air police service, this time no longer with Tiger aircraft rented by Switzerland, but with the new Eurofighers.
The cost of the safety of the WEF amounts to almost CHF 8 million.This is much more than the a few hundred thousand francs in the early years of the WEF, but significantly less than the maximum of 13.5 million in 2003. The army arises compared to normal repeat courses from the associations involved.
The distribution key for the security effort has been the same for years: WEF and Graubünden, three eighth of the federal government, take over two eighths, the last eighth is the landscape (municipality) Davos Wiesen.Soldiers assemble the grid and barbed wire at the heliport in Stilli in Davos Dorf.

Spectator terrace on Dock E open / / Kloten.- As of this Tuesday, the spectator terrace on Dock E is open at Zurich Airport.
This was intended as a replacement for the closed spectator terrace on Dock B, unique said yesterday.The building will be demolished by October 2009 and replaced by a new “flexible Schengen and Non-Schengen-Dock”.In March, Unique also wants to start building a centralized security check.
The new four -storey control building should also be completed by the end of 2011, it is said.The spectator terrace E is located on the west side of the terminal.Visitors get there by bus.
The shuttle buses as well as the still offered tours start from a newly created bus building that is near arrival 2.Visitors have to go through the mandatory security control there and reach the vehicles via a wheelchair -accessible ramp.In winter, these run every half hour from 9.15 a.m. to 5.15 p.m.
Special advance tours take place in Kloten this week.Aviatik fans from all over the world can observe and photograph the aircraft and helicopters of the WEF participants.According to the organizers, most of the 24 tours are already fully booked.

Boeing with losses / / the US aircraft and armaments group Boeing flew into the loss zone after a week-long strike at the end of 2008.The company also had to hit its profit forecast for the current year on Wednesday.
The bottom line was a minus of $ 56 million in the final quarter near Boeing due to a strike and due to major problems with new aircraft types.Due to the delivery failures, sales collapsed 27 percent to $ 12.7 billion (around CHF 10.8 billion).A year earlier, the group had made more than one billion dollar profit.
The result was far worse than expected from analysts on average.The stock was still up to the US trade on Wednesday thanks to a strong overall market.Delay.
Throughout 2008, the surplus fell by around a third to $ 2.7 billion.Sales fell by eight percent to $ 60.9 billion.The almost two -month strike pressed the result by $ 1.8 billion.
Massive delays in the new Jumbo models 787 and 747 - 8 cost another $ 685 million.The order stock, on the other hand, reached the new record height of $ 352 billion at the end of the year - an increase of eight percent for the previous year.Boeing wants to deliver 480 to 485 commercial aircraft in the current year.
The group now expects sales of $ 68 to $ 69 billion in 2009.The profit should be significantly lower than planned.Finally, Boeing had to postpone the start of the 787 “Dreamliner” prestige project again.

As in Sabena times, Brussels should become a hub again / / Sabena successor Brussels Airlines expects to join Star Alliance and under the Lufthansa roof with growth opportunities in the long-distance area from Brussels airport.It is a little irony of history.
Seven or eight years ago there was still the Atlantic Excellence alliance, including Austrian Airlines and Swissair.At that time, Swissair, as part of the notorious Hunter strategy, also participated in airlines such as the Belgian Sabena.Among other signs, many of the companies involved or at least their successors have now found each other again: Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines as part of the growing Lufthansa group.
Another hub in Brusselsbrussel's Airlines has already taken the next step in its development.In September, Lufthansa decided to buy 45 percent on the company and to integrate it similar to the Swiss.In the meantime, the Star Alliance board heads have decided to include Brussels as an independent member of their alliance.
This increases again for the Belgian airline the opportunity to create a turnstile in Brussels - a project that predecessor Sabena failed terrific.The story of Brussels is most likely to be compared to that of the Swiss.Both were created after the collapse of Swissair and Sabena on the basis of the regional divisions Crossair and Delta Air Transport.
But at Brussels, the cut was perhaps even more radical.The small airline took over the former Sabena fleet almost nothing, and she also completely said goodbye to the idea of organizing a turnstile with many long-distances for a few years.Brussels only wanted to serve the local market and also only received the lucrative routes to Africa, ultimately a late remains from the Belgian colonial era.
The strategy largely worked, because Brussels managed to have a small profit in the past six years.For 2008, too, this could forecast Bernard Gustin.Gustin is new in his position, but for many in the company an old acquaintance.
The business plan for SN Brussels comes from him, as the company was originally called and before the merger with Virgin Express.But now he is taking the strategic swivel-Brussels is supposed to be a star alliance turntop.After seven years of profitable growth, the airline now wants to take another step.
In his opinion, the most important goal is to better connect Brussels to long distances.Through partnerships with the other star alliance members and as part of the large Lufthansa sales network, significantly more long distances from Brussels are to be profitable than was previously possible.However, according to Gustin, not only Brussel's airlines will benefit.
The Star Alliance as a whole has an interest in strategically positioning itself between Amsterdam and Paris with a hub.Finally, 25 million people can be reached from Brussels within two hours.So far, Brussel's Airlines has perceived the network of high -speed trains such as the valley as a threat.
But Gustin calculates that the traffic flows could reverse in the medium term and that passengers could travel to Brussels-Airlines flights by train.In three to four years, Zaventem Airport should also have its own train station for long -distance transport.And the airport was built for the demands of the old Sabena anyway, so there is enough space for expansion plans.
The small airline now has to tackle less homogeneous flotted hole, and of all places in the middle of the largest industry crisis for 25 years.Due to the merger with Virgin Express, the company has a little harmonized fleet.Brussels operates both Boeings 737 - 300/400 and Airbusse A319 on the European line in demand.
The 26 Avro regional jets are still relatively young at an average of 12.2 years and only have to be replaced in the medium term.Three of the four Airbusse A330 - 300 have built in 1994, one even in 1993, so they have to be replaced.Basically, Brussels Airlines should be very good that Lufthansa has ordered massive aircraft of all sizes under other conditions.
After stamping her own growth plans for 2009, the new subsidiary could receive some of the new aircraft.The Embraer 195 or the Bombardier C series, which Lufthansa will receive in the next few years, will also be considered as candidates for replacing the AVROs.Austrian also hopes for new jets from the large Lufthansa portfolio.

Leuenberger: Survival of the Swiss endangered / / Bern, January 30 (SDA) A no from the Swiss voting folk on February 8th would have serious consequences for the freedom of the people for the air, Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger in his internet blog writes.
The survival of the airline Swiss is even at the game.In the event of a no, the first package of bilateral contracts would be dissolved with the EU, the Minister of Transport states.And «Without the air traffic agreement with the EU, Swiss could hardly survive economically.
Unfortunately, it doesn't help that it belongs to Lufthansa.»The previous agreements with individual states would again apply here which line flights enable to these countries.
But the Swiss would be largely denied access to the Inner European route network, writes Leuenberger.Specifically, the Swiss could still offer flights from Zurich to Berlin, but no further flights to Stockholm or Helsinki, no flights from Rome to Paris.The Skyguide air traffic control is also dependent on close cooperation with the EU countries in order to be able to secure their existence.
Air traffic is connected to numerous suppliers and crucial for the location of companies.This also includes numerous jobs, Federal Councilor Leuenberger continues.In Switzerland, 180,000 jobs with a added value of over CHF 26 billion deployed directly or indirectly from the civil aviation, says Paul Kurrus, President of the Swiss Aviation Association, Aerosuisse.

The logisticians caught it cold / / Stefan Schupplidie Transport logistics reacts very quickly to economic changes.
This is again the case in this downturn.It has been clear since December of last year at the latest: the international transport industry is under the bikes.
The air freight, the IATA aviation association recently reported, broken down by 22.6 percent in December.The worry about it: the setback was quickly, at the same time and almost everywhere in the world.Nobody had expected that.
So far, economists assumed that Asia is an economic support.But in Asia, the decline was the greatest decline in 26 percent.The global economy is already braking.
Because freight and air freight is an early indicator of economic development.The crash of 22.6 percent brings the industry to an unexplored territory with no ground view.Buckle up, »says IATA director Giovanni Bisignani.
Less traffic .Container traffic suffered a similar fate, if not so violent.Due to declining demand, fewer container ships will run between Asia and Europe in the future.
The Grand Alliance, the world's most important network of container line shipping companies, reduces its capacity on this route by twelve percent. "By the last quarter, the year was actually very good," says Beat Simon, European boss of the forwarding group Agility in Basel.The weak demand for high -tech, permanent consumer goods and the break -in in the car industry had an impact on logistics, "quickly," says Simon.The auto industry has been very much down with its production and has sometimes "prescribed" holidays.
The sales of the German auto industry have shrunk by a third in December, as was known yesterday.So far, pharmaceuticals have been well over the end.Geographically, Scandinavia and Switzerland are less affected in Europe.
"I have the impression that there is currently massive warehouse," comments Simon.On the ground .
«We have to adapt very quickly, says Nando Cesarone, head of UPS Europa in Basel - a credo that is reserved without reservation by all logistics.For logistics groups with aircraft, this means: aircraft have to stay on the ground, ships in the harbor.
Only: It's not always so easy.After all, freight companies want to offer the most dense network as possible, a timetable.In the express freight area in particular, aircraft will achieve less high loads.
Martin Spohn, spokesman for the worldwide Panalpina Group, points out that shipping companies have built enormous overcapacity in recent years.Ships also drive if they are not busy;However, this presses on the margins.
As an organizer of freight services, Panalpina also feels the decline.But it has no ships, aircraft or storage rooms in her possession that must be busy.Agility, UPS and Panalpina come to the aid of the diversification of the business.
This creates a certain risk of risk.And Cesarone from UPS is convinced: «A good organization can also help companies save costs.And that is the bid of the hour. »The industry agrees:
The current year will be very hard.The express freight companies Fedex and UPS speak openly about the most difficult year in their history.Nobody dares for forecasts.
Significantly fewer containers on the Rhine -weak December.The container envelope in the Swiss Rhine ports lost 11.4 percent last year.Nevertheless, the 92,500 converted container units (TEU) represent the second best result of the Rhine port, the Rheinhafenverwaltung writes in a media release from yesterday Monday.
The break -in in export ( - 18 percent) reflects the currently prevailing economic development, with the last quarter in particular noticed.In December the decline was 30 percent.After a dry spell of two years, more liquid drift and fuels were added or exported over the Swiss Rhine ports in 2008.

Flight accident in the Engadine: Cause Unclear / / Samedan.
- The 54-year-old survivor of the Samedan aircraft accident is the Austrian billionaire Alexander Kahane.Kahane survived the accident with broken ribs and arm and leg injuries.According to the Austrian media reports, he is eleventh with an estimated assets of two billion euros in the richest Austrian.
The pilot and the Copilot had not survived.The pilot is a 69-year-old man who was Kopilot 41 years old.The exact cause of the accident was initially unclear.
The office for flight accident examinations in the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication conducts the investigation.According to the management of the Engadine Airport, it is the first fatal jet accident on the highest airfield in Europe.The company did not comment on the ongoing investigations, but emphasizes that the prerequisites for the operation of the airport were definitely met at the time of the accident.

The accident plane was controlled by autopilot / / Buffalo.- The devastating aircraft accident in the US state of New York apparently goes back to a loss of buoyancy due to icing.
The crew had apparently fought against this problem until the end.This indicates several information from flight writers and voice recordings from the Combarder Q400 type, which crashed into a house ten kilometers before Buffalo on Thursday evening.All 49 inmates died, another person was killed in the house.
The machine was controlled by autopilot until the end.This contradicts the rules of the aviation authority in the event of severe icing problems, as the National Office for Road Safety announced on Sunday.It still had to be found why the pilot acted like this.
At the weekend, the investigators found that the aircraft did not hit the house, contrary to eyewitness reports.Rather, it opened flat beforehand and rolled a bit before the house hit it.The aircraft nose did not show in the direction of the land railway ten kilometers away, but in the precisely opposite direction.
Safety system was activated that the machine surveillance system had warned the pilot from an icing of the wings.According to control lights, the de -icing system was switched on whether it worked, but was unclear.If this is not the case, guidelines recommend an 180-degree turn to get rid of the ice.
The security system also automatically initiated a counter -measure, it says: The so -called Stick Pusher probably not only drawn attention to the pilot in the dangerous location, but also steered the nose of the machine to the ground to shake off ice.At first, however, the investigators could only find that these mechanisms were activated - not whether they worked.(AP)

Singapore Airlines expects the slump in demand / / rt.Singapore, 16.
February according to Air France-KLM and other European airlines, the second largest Asian carrier (according to Japan Airlines) has now announced massive capacity cuts.At the beginning of the new financial year in six weeks, Singapore Airlines 17 of the 101 aircraft will pull out of circulation and has announced cuts in the staff at that time.
One speaks of capacity reductions in the range of 11 %.The fact that society takes a second, larger step just one month after the first capacity adjustment shows how drastically the industry economy has deteriorated.The company, whose share price has lost around a third with the local stock market barometer compared to the previous year, assumes 20 % for 2009.
The estimate is based on the local figures of international air freight traffic, which are considered the forelestant indicator.In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recorded a profit of $ 225 million with $ 4.12 billion.However, the number of passengers (4.8 million) was already 4.2 % below the previous year.
The business class is particularly affected.Here the airline has already reduced the range of single-class business flights.In the freight area, the slump made 14.2 % between October and December.

The canton of Zurich wants to prevent a slope expansion / / The cantonal council will advise three initiatives to the airport next Monday.There will be new alliances and trenches across the factions.
By Liliane Minorzürich.- A popular and two authorities initiatives are on the agenda of the cantonal council on Monday.All you have the goal of reducing the noise pollution for the population around the airport - however, the means to achieve this goal is very different (see also overview below).
The popular initiative entitled “Fair Flight” wants to distribute entrances and departures in such a way that all regions temporarily have rest.One initiative would like to reduce the number of flight movements to 320,000 and increase the night's sleep to eight hours, the other requires a ban on slopes.Only the ban on expansion has a realistic chance of a yes.
Among other things, the bourgeois cantonal councils from the Zurich Unterland are responsible for this."We have agreed and everyone will vote," says Martin Mossdorf (FDP, Bülach).This is also confirmed by Werner Bosshard (SVP), who, as the former mayor of Rümlang, personally signed the authorities initiative.
No parliamentary pressure for SVP and FDPMind in the FDP will also vote for the ban on expansion from the east of the airport - above all, parliamentary group leader Thomas Vogel (Illnau -Effretikon).He has no problem with the disagreement in his faction: «We discussed this in detail, and nobody in the faction bothered it.»
Different in the SVP.Their traffic specialist Lorenz Habicher (Zurich) makes no secret of the fact that the division disturbs him.He hopes "that we can still get a no".
Group compulsion is not an issue, assured.However, pure unity is not on the other side of the council.Especially in SP and CVP, individual abstentions or even votes are mainly expected from politicians from the southern aisle and from Zurich, but significantly less than yes votes on the bourgeois side. "Fair flight" in parliament can be expected without a chance.Is the no to the “Fairflug” Volks initiative.
Even Greens reject the concern.Only isolated yes can be expected, but from the entire council spectrum.A surprise could occur depending on the course of the debate at the other initiative.
The concern is only supported by Greens and SP, while most other factions, even from the SVP, can at most be expected.That would be clear - if Benno Scherrer (GLP, Uster) had not submitted a counter -proposal.The main criticism of the initiative is the eight hours of sleep, and this criticism takes on Scherrer:
He proposes the same Plafond, but with seven hours of sleep.The federal reaction is always unclear the council and in September the voters will only decide: all concerns have one problem in common.
Airport policy is primarily a federal matter.And the concerns come very late.Because the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) is already working on the final report on the above -mentioned infrastructure.
What this will look like has long been clear: three operating variants are planned, two of which rely on the current operating system.The third is based on an extension of slopes 10/28 to the west, which would result in a large part of today's southern trips over the east.
Bazl spokesman Daniel Göring did not want to tell the TA what effects the initiatives that come up in Bern on Monday and whether they are even taken into account.Aircraft noise fairly distribute 320 000 movement slopes expansion ban is the template? «Fair flight» is the title of the popular initiative, which was launched by the aircraft noise solidarity in the east.Goal: distribute the aircraft noise fairly with rotation and time windows.
This is to ensure that all regions temporarily have rest.Specifically, as far as Germany is allowed, approaches should take place 14 and 16 from the north;In the rest of the time, the approaches with time windows should be distributed to slopes 14 (cranked north approach), 28, 32 and 34.
Should be started in the direction of the destination;An aircraft to Rome would start on slopes 14 or 16, one to Moscow on slopes 10, one to Paris on slopes 28.69 municipalities in this initiative in the protection association that was launched by the protection association that the number of flight movements is plated at 320,000 and that the night's sleep at eightHours is extended.The canton should not only work for the federal government, but also on the board of directors of the airport.
This authority initiative was signed by 42 municipalities;The protection association also launched it.It demands that the canton to defend itself against any removal and new buildings of slopes at the federal government and the board of directors of the airport.
Who are the supporters and what arguments do you lead?The rotation principle is supported by most citizen organizations and the protection association.The main argument of the supporters is justice:
All regions are said to have noise, but everyone should also be entitled to rest periods.According to the initiators, “fair flight” also has the advantage that the airport is not restricted in its development.Starts are also most environmentally friendly.
This initiative is supported in addition to the municipalities of SP and the Greens, as well as by the citizens' organizations.They indicate that the required cornerstones correspond to a broad consensus: the cantonal council has approved these values as well as the - now dissolved - round table of the community representatives.
Finally, the Zurich aircraft mining, which the voters agreed in November 2007, is more and more an unsuitable instrument for noise control.The initiative is supported in the cantonal council from green to CVP;But numerous parliamentarians from SVP and FDP also speak out for this.
Most civil organizations also support the ban on expansion.Their most important argument is planning security for residents and municipalities.They also say that an extension of slopes 10/28 is far too expensive.
They also hope to relax in the dispute over the flight routes.Who are the opponents and what arguments do you lead?All parties reject “fair flight”, as well as the government council.
They do not consider the initiative to be implemented: only the topography and the weather speak against it;It also contradicts the Environmental Protection Act of distributing noise.
Above all, leftists also point out that a skillful distribution of the approaches and departures would lead to a massive capacity expansion without the number of people affected by the noise.The initiative is also rejected by the Flight Laby South Association - No.In the cantonal council, a large majority from SVP to GLP reject the authorities initiative, as well as the government council.
The main argument is the eight -hour night's sleep;There are already seven hours for lifting operations in Zurich on the border of the justifiable.The government also argues that the authority initiative is the position of the Zurich flight sound mining (ZFI) just introduced:
This is designed for seven hours of sleep and would have to be recalculated completely.In addition, a movement plan fund violates international law.The government and a majority of the FDP and SVP are against the initiative, as are the municipalities in the south of the airport and the Verein Flugschneise Süd - no.
You do not want to exclude an option from the outset for the airport;Above all, an extension of the slopes 10/28 could lead to a noisy flight operation, because then part of the southern trips would be omitted.In addition, the people have to vote on any changes to the slopes anyway.
What's next?If the cantonal council rejects the template, it is expected to come to the people on September 27th.It is uncertain whether the concern would be implemented in the event of a yes.
The government would only be obliged to work for a corresponding flight regime;The coincide competence lies with the federal government.If the cantonal council rejects the agency initiative, it is off the table.
The people can no longer decide.The cantonal council will probably accept the authorities initiative.However, it can be assumed that the opponents require a referendum.

As a Leuthamtel driver on the snow front / / Roland Moser from Rafz and his approximately 120 colleagues from the Airfield Maintance department are proud if your airport works even in deep winter conditions.By Thomas Baerkloten.
- Roland Moser, cleaning employees at Zurich Airport, has not noticed that he has been on his feet since 2 a.m.He proudly leads through the winter service hall, where the approximately 100 snow clearing machines are available for use at any time.The oldest evacuation group, consisting of eight train vehicles with snow plow, steel brush and blower, was replaced for this winter.
«The new evacuation group consists of seven jetbroom compact egg holder with its eight meter wide, fold-out plow.A new snow blower with 2000 hp performance was also purchased, »explains Moser, who has been traveling as a chauffeur of area cleaning on the airport area for 18 years.The work is hard and not for everyone.
"Getting getting up early in the middle of the night takes some getting used to," says Moser with a smile, "but we are extremely proud that Zurich Airport has never had to be closed because of snow.»Around 300 employees - 120 from the responsible department of Airfield Maintenance and 180 external commissioned chauffeurs - are used in different groups.From the beginning of November to the end of March, they are ready for use around the clock.
And so the aircraft can usually start and land with little delays on snow days."We are just a winter airport, in contrast to certain other European hubs." To predict the convoy of eleven vehicles due to the meteorological conditions, is already scheduled accordingly in the evening."Of course, this requires great flexibility for each individual," says Moser.
“Going out and sleeping late is out of the question.One is strongly tied to working hours.»The use of the snowmen usually begins with the contingent at 3 a.m.
An hour later, one of the three large room trains made of eight clearing vehicles, two single plows and the slingshot are ready, and the night exit at Schneegestöber can begin.The 18 -ton machines ride a staggered in a row.With the plow, starting, landingways and roller paths are roughly freed from the snow masses
The three and a half to five and a half meter wide rotating brushes, which are attached between the front and rear axles, wipe the surface-free and ice-free surface.Finally, the surface is dried with the rear blower, which "shoots" on the concrete at around 250 km / h.If necessary, the flight surfaces - slopes, roller paths and stands - are sprayed with an environmentally friendly stew.
This ensures that the snow does not start again.Salt is not used because it would attack chassis, wiring areas and engines of the aircraft. "As a" Leithammel driver ", I am always on the snow front," says Moser.
All drivers are connected to the head of operations, who drives with the passenger car and monitors everything.«It is a big challenge to listen to the different radio sayings.You have to be extremely concentrated and watch everything, »says Moser.
With strong snowfall and pitch -infider night, it is sometimes difficult to keep your orientation.«But when I drive, I'm wide awake;It is pure adrenaline.
You can't afford mistakes. »Thanks to piloting, his family has to come to terms with Moser's working hours, says the Rafzer.«For the first time in my almost two decades of working time at the airport, I had to move out last New Year's Eve.»But thanks to overtime, Moser travels across Europe with his two sons and his wife in his motorhome during the school holidays.
The Rafzer does not want to miss his work.It is estimated: it happens that pilots would like to thank the snowmen for the nightly cleaning of the slopes.

"Like a case into the emptiness" / / a Boeing 737 of the Turkish airlines yesterday morning at Amsterdam crashed into a field.At least nine people were killed, including the three pilots.
More than 50 passengers were injured, 25 of them seriously, as a spokesman for the Dutch authorities said.134 people were on board, including 78 Turks and 56 foreigners.The accident occurred a few hundred meters from a highway.
At 10:31 a.m., the Boeing crashed half a kilometer before reaching the runway at Schiphol Airport and broke into several parts.The Turkish Ministry of Transport initially claimed that nobody had died.The authorities later had to correct this information.
At the airports of Istanbul and Amsterdam, despair spread among relatives.Cause unclear."At first it was a normal landing, and then it suddenly felt like a case," said passenger Tuncer Mutluh to the Turkish news channel NTV.
“The plane got out of control, fell and crashed.“Everything was a matter of a few seconds.His traveling Kerem Uzel adds that the machine with the rear first came up on the floor, slid down next to a expressway and came to a stand in a field.
At that time there was a bad view.Speculation that the flyer ran out of fuel was not confirmed.Airney experts did not rule out that the pilot wanted to make an emergency landing due to technical problems.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Transport, the plane was built in 2003 and was regularly serviced.The Turkish Airlines is relatively far back in ranking lists on flight safety;The reason, however, is accidents that were sometimes decades ago.
The company has lost ten aircraft since 1973.The worst misfortune in which 346 people died occurred in 1974. Lately the company has changed and has a state -of -the -art aircraft fleet and a new training concept.

Cause of fatal crash landing unclear / / When a machine of the Turkish Airlines crashed near the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, 9 passengers died yesterday.By Elsbeth Gugger, Amsterdamta's Aircraft of the Boeing 737 Aircraft was on the way from Istanbul to Amsterdam yesterday morning.
Around 3 kilometers before the start of the landing slope, the machine fell on a field for a few hundred meters next to a busy motorway and broke into three parts.In the impact, nine of the 134 passengers died, including three crew members.The Dutch authorities did not confirm whether the two pilots are among the dead, as the media person reported on site.
In Ankara, however, the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the captain, his Kopilot and a pilot in training would not have survived the accident.The number of injuries had to be corrected in the evening: a total of 86 passengers were brought to eleven surrounding hospitals by ambulance vehicles.
Six of the injuries were in a critical state of health, it said at a press conference at the airport.The cause of the accident of the TK 1951 flight has not been clarified until the hour.Several survivors told on the Dutch television that the plane was floated briefly before moving to Schiphol and then sagged vertically downwards in a free case, where it landed very hard on the plowed field.
Speculation and confusion of the accident machine were widely scattered;A engine was found a few hundred meters next to the Boeing.The black box was also secured on Wednesday afternoon.
The fact that no fire arose after the crash landing gave the reason for speculation that the machine had assumed the fuel - however, this was not confirmed.Aerospace experts rather said that the pilot wanted technical problems because of emergency landing.The affected airline and the Turkish authorities caused further confusion.
Just a few minutes after the accident, the Turkish Ministry of Transport and Turkish Airlines asserted that there were no deaths.The airline also claimed this when reporters reported on site on site.And Premier Erdogan made a media declaration in the afternoon in which he emphasized that the accident machine was always well serviced.

Broken landing of a Turkish Boeing at Amsterdam / / A plane crash at Amsterdam cost 9 people on Wednesday.A Boeing 737 of the Turkish Airlines crashed to Schiphol Airport during the approach.
The initial hope that all passengers survived was not confirmed.Brussels, February 25th Flight TK 1951 started at 8.22 a.m. in Istanbul and should have landed in Amsterdam-Schiphol at 10.40 a.m.
There were 127 passengers and 7 crew members on board.At 10:31 a.m., the plane fell 500 meters in front of the runway onto a field and broke into three parts.Strictly speaking, it was not a crash, but a crash landing.
The plane did not go up in flames.The rescue workers were quickly at the scene of the accident, which is only about a hundred meters away from a highway.Fortunately, nearby houses remained intact.
The cause was temporarily unclear. The accident cost 9 people life, 50 others were injured, as a spokesman for the Dutch authorities said.He spoke of 25 seriously injured.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Transport, 78 Turks and 56 foreigners were on board.The airline and Turkish Transport Minister Binalirim had initially announced that all occupants had survived.At this point, however, news portals spread Dutch and international media
Already pictures that demonstrated the opposite: the removal of corpses was already in full swing.The hoped -for “Miracle of Amsterdam” failed to materialize, and the initial relief turned into mourning.The cause of the crash was still unclear on Wednesday.
The crashed Boeing 737 was built in 2003.According to the Turkish Minister of Transport, the machine was last checked by the flight authority on December 22, 2008.The pilot apparently did not send an emergency call.
Speculation that the fuel may have ended was not confirmed.Vogelschlag also spoke in Dutch media.At the time of the accident, there was a bad view and a slight wind blew, but these conditions are routine in European winter.
Airney experts did not rule out that the pilot wanted to be in the field due to technical problems.In fact, the engines were "torn down".The aircraft are designed in such a way that in the event of an impact, the engines break off so that the fuselage and especially the wing in which the kerosene is located are no longer damaged.
Many passengers were able to climb from the aircraft wreck on their own.Passengers surveyed by journalists stated that they were not pointed out to an emergency landing.After turbulence, the machine was suddenly sagged and impacted.
Numerous crash turkish Airlines is considered one of the most uncertain airlines in the world.The company has lost ten aircraft since 1973.The worst misfortune occurred on March 3, 1974: 346 people were killed when a DC-10 crashed after the start in Paris-Orly.
The last fatal accident of a Turkish Airlines machine occurred on January 8, 2003. In dense fog, the pilots missed the runway of Diyarbakir Airport in the southeast of Turkey, then 75 people died.The fleet has been modernized in recent years, and the airline has therefore also been included in the Star Alliance.
Amsterdam Airport was also not spared heavy aircraft gaps.In October 1992, a Boeing 747 freight machine from the Israeli Society of El Al fell into high-rise buildings in the Bijlmermeer district, with 43 people found death.Schiphol is one of the 20 largest airports in the world, with its 48 million passengers annually, it is an important hub of European aviation.
Blackbox recovered (dpa) When the passenger machine crashed, the three pilots died.This was announced by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.
The captain of the machine, his co-pilot and a pilot in the training would not have survived the accident, Erdogan said. (AP) The investigators hope for information about the cause of the accident.The voice and data recorder that recorded all flight data and conversations in the cockpit was found a few hours after the crash.The rescue workers are quickly at the scene of the accident and mountains survivors and fatalities.

For some pilots, the new regulation means that from March 1st, sailing pilots over 60 have to be examined regularly medically and flying.The federal government is shooting out, a Näniker Pilot finds.
By Pia Strawoberland.- The Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (Uvek) issued new rules for glider pilots on March 1.This implements the measures of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) decided last year.
This demands from glider pilots over 60 to have a specialized doctor examined every two years and complete a review flight.The Federal Office does not extend the flight brevet of those who do not follow this regulation.The pilots are also obliged by the new regulation to report all medically relevant incidents to the Bazl.
"This means that these pilots have to contact us if, for example, they suffer from circulatory disorders or take medication that leads to fatigue," explains Bazl spokesman Anton Kohler.Check flight is about taking a close look at the behavior of the glider pilots over 60.“Leave his skills to be desired, the flight instructor suggests the pilot.»
And if the safety of the glider pilot is seriously at risk, the teacher has the obligation to make this known to the Bazl.«The gray area is big.But many pilots know that their skills lose weight in old age, »Kohler is convinced.
For example, they could not be compared to young car cups.In their training, pilots learned to deal with the dangers of a wide variety of ways."You are well aware of the risk of your hobby." The Näniker Heiri Berchtold is 64 years old and has been a glider pilot since he was 20.
In his logbook, he was able to enter over 2000 flight hours.Berchtold is of the opinion that the Bazl shoots out the target with this regulation.«The federal government apparently was forced to react to the many deaths in recent years.»
Like many colleagues, however, he was regularly checked before this regulation.Sail pilots endanger themselves the hobby of the poor pilots, and this new regulatory also makes it even more expensive, the Näniker complains.
«And whether the accident rate will really drop is questionable.»The Bazl had the task of protecting uninvolved.The fact is, however, that third parties would be very rarely violated when the gliders crash.
"Sail pilots usually endanger itself, for example, this can be measured at the price of mandatory liability insurance," says Berchtold.He pays around CHF 240 for his plane annually."It couldn't be that cheap if the glider flying were considered a great risk." The dead angle for glider pilots is more dangerous than the progressive age.
"An mandatory for devices that recognize other planes would therefore be more sensible than these checks," says the Näniker.Good club climate increases Sicherheitrolf Lutz is a board member of the engine and glider group Zürcher Oberland (FGZO).
He is responsible for 30 glider pilots.«The security of the club members is very important to me.This new regulation promotes you and is therefore in my sense, »says Lutz.
The group of glider pilots over 60 is relatively large in Switzerland, he knows.«And this new regulation will certainly mean that they are no longer allowed to climb into a cockpit.»Because of the crashes last year, he dealt intensively with the topic of security this winter.
This is influenced by the aircraft manufacturer, the Bazl, the club and above all by the pilot."But it is based on communication between the pilots", Lutz is convinced. "Security can only be prescribed limited by checklists.It is about promoting awareness in this regard.»
It is extremely important that pilots can draw each other's attention to misconduct.«And this is only possible if the club climate is good and the handling of camaraderie is.»The 58-year-old has been piling up glider for ten years and has now collected 350 flight hours.
He knows that it is important to inform in aviation.«We are careful to anonymize events and then sprinkle as wide as possible.»This enables the pilots to use the errors as security resources.

The success model of the Chilean Lan Airlines / / The Chilean LAN Airlines has been on an expansive course for an expansive course for a decade.It not only masters her home market, but is also active with subsidiaries in Peru, Ecuador and Argentina.
How nice it would be if the airlines finally left the legal restrictions behind and fly where they wanted.If you are allowed to enter new markets with a good product and could better spread your own economic risk.If you were financially so successful that the rating agencies grant an investment grade that makes loans and investments cheaper.
To date, there are only a few examples in the global aviation industry where this applies.One of the best can be found in South America, on a continent that is more connected in air traffic with questionable security standards, old aircraft, bankruptcy and insufficient service.Chilean Lan Airlines has had an astonishing success story there in the past ten years and could thus become a model for other regions.
The LAN1998 three -column model was a typical airline that operated far away from the large traffic flows in Chile.If Lan Chile then wanted to grow, she had to look for other markets.Their happiness was the weakness of the competition and the interest of the governments of other Latin American countries to maintain an air traffic infrastructure.
In 1999 she founded Lan Peru, who received approval for domestic and international flights.In 2003 a first breakthrough in Ecuador, from where LAN has been allowed to operate international routes since then.
And in 2005 the airline also expanded its network to Argentina.Today it comes to a market share of 70 percent in domestic traffic and 52 percent on international routes.In Peru it is 86 and 30 percent, in Argentina 27 and 16 percent.
And thanks to LAN, Ecuador has a direct connection to Europe again via the mini hub in Madrid.Today the business model from LAN rests on three pillars: a third of sales are created on the international routes, a third on the domestic routes, and a third controls the freight area.
In 2008, the structure delivered a brilliant economic result: with sales of $ 4.5 billion, LAN achieved an operational profit of 536 million.LAN is known for your high quality product on the long distances.
However, the airline has long changed the strategy on the domestic routes and approached the recipes of the cheap airlines.This is intended to increase the entry barrier for non -welcome new competitors.The company is also organized as decentrally and diversified as the business.
The Chilean domestic business and international routes are controlled by the group headquarters in Santiago de Chile.The freight center is not even in South America, but in Miami, where the freight turn is also located.The country organizations in Peru, Ecuador and Argentina are either responsible for their own domestic routes or are only assisting when carrying out international connections (Ecuador).
LAN has decided in all the new initiatives to found new subsidiaries and not to buy local airlines.CEO Enrique Cueto argues that this does not have to be adopted old structures and that the work rules and payment of LAN would be defined himself.Only in Brazil does LAN relate very back until further notice and prefers to cooperate with Tam Brazil.
According to Cueto, Lan prefers to concentrate on countries in which the domestic carriers do not represent great competition.In Brazil, by far the largest sub -market in South America, two comparatively strong airlines are already represented with Tam and Gol.For lan
Argentina also predicts Cueto more problematic times because the Argentine government has just nationalized the competitors of Aerolínea's Argentinas and, according to the LAN boss, it will assume that it will be preferred when allocating traffic rights.Waiting for the 787 in the European traffic of the geographical distribution of the many local turnstile leads to the fact that LAN can use the fleet very efficiently.For example, it can link the Boeing 767 long distances from Santiago to Miami with comparatively short connections to Lima and Guayaquil.
Only when it comes to European traffic is physical limits to the inventory spirit.Neither the 26 Boeing 767 - 300 nor the 5 Airbus A340 - 300 make it deeper to Europe than to Madrid.The A340 are used from Santiago, the Boeing 767 from Guayaquil and Lima.
Up to five machines end up in Madrid and then start within a short time.Only one of them flies again in Europe, namely to Frankfurt.The procedure could only change if the first Boeings 787 arrive, which with their larger reach could then also control other goals.
However, the question is still whether this makes commercially useful or whether you continue to leave it to the partner Iberia to distribute traffic in Europe.But that is the future music, at first LAN also has to fly through the deepest industry crisis for a long time.Especially in important freight traffic, the South American airline also feels the decline in demand, the passenger business is even more stable.
Sometimes it is better to be a little further away from the main markets, says Enrique Cueto.Then the crises do not hit you so hard.Jens Flottau

"The rail connection is mandatory" / / interview: Peter Schenknachdem have spoken out for the rail connection, the ball is now in Alsace, the airport director says.Baden-Württemberg's Prime Minister Günther Oettinger promised CHF 15 million last week for the rail connection of EuroAirport (EAP).
The overall project is estimated at around CHF 253 million.In the interview, EAP director Jürg Rämi comments on what that means for the airport and how the project is.BAZ: What does Prime Minister Günther Oettinger's promise mean for the train connection?
Jürg Rämi: I welcome the positive decision of the Prime Minister.He is now giving the project thrust again.This increased the opportunities.
Switzerland spoke CHF 25 million for the rail connection, which are enrolled in the package of high -speed tension connections HGV.The cantons of Basel-Stadt and Baselland have made commitments-even if they are not yet quantified.Now the ball lies with the Alsace region.
What's next?I think the chances that we will come together and solve the financing question are relatively good.We also advertised a public private partnership.
This means that we are looking for a private investor for part of the financing.Will the EAP be financed?We don't know the height yet, but the airport would also be willing to make a contribution.
There is only a good quarter of the costs.So it is exaggerated to speak of strongly increased opportunities for realizing the rail connection!I don't say that the project is decided or won.
But there is a positive boost.Switzerland and Germany have spoken out for the train connection and now France will also be out of comment.How do you rate the chances for this?
Do you have signals from France?No .Specifically, I can't say anything.
I know that the dossier is checked at the Alsace region and also in Paris.There are business development investments in all countries.It would be possible for us to get loans in this context.
The financing question should be solved, but it has not yet been done.I am an optimist, but not idealist.Do you think something will move over the next ten years?
There is currently an opportunity to realize the train connection.However, calling a specific time frame is always difficult.In the next ten years, however, the connection must come.
How long does the implementation take after a financing decision?This will definitely take another two to three years.All work must be advertised publicly.
But first the financing is needed.A simple project is currently planned, in which two tracks from the north and south leave the conventional train route and lead to EuroAirport.Do they agree with each other?
There is consensus.The terrains are already reserved.We are on French soil and there is a decree of the Préfecture, which defines these terrains very precisely.
There are no more difficulties.We have no building permits yet, but we know where the route carries out.What would the train station look like?
It is planned smaller than originally planned.There are two perrons instead of four.This optimization was developed with the ETH Lausanne last year.
However, the other two perrons are reserved.Perhaps we will build parking spaces there that are canceled if we should later create the next perrons there.How important is a train connection for the airport?
It is central strategically.The travelers want to get to the airport more and more.Take skiers.
If the pound is stronger again, the English could climb the direct train to Interlaken and go skiing to the Bernese Oberland.This is more interesting than taking the bus and then having to repack again.Comfort, ecological considerations and the realization speak for the train connection that modes of transport must be linked.
The train station was built 30 years ago at Zurich Airport.Today there is a huge local and regional traffic junction with trains to Geneva and St. Gallen.You also have to look at a train connection strategically medium and long-term.
What does that mean for Basel?There is another reason here that speaks for the train connection: Basel assumes that the road capacities will become scarce at some point.
Then you will be happy if the airport bus no longer drives through the city every seven minutes.In the long term, the rail connection is therefore mandatory.In the short term we can get along well without him.

"It also needs humility" / / crash landings on the Hudson River, in Amsterdam and in Romania raise questions about flight safety.Werner Alex Walser, retired Swissair-Captain, answers the most important.
By Peter Holenstein and Vera Hartmann (picture) What is going through your head when you read about aircraft falls or emergency landings?Déjà vu - often the same causes or the same mistakes..
.With the exception of the watering in the Hudson, maybe.The most common pilot errors are?
Misorial pretations, promises, misunderstandings with the tower, mismanagement, incorrect view, too much risk, too late corrections or too late intervention and negligence.Which emergency scenarios fear pilots the most?Terror, fire or smoke on board;
The total failure of all engines, electrics or hydraulics as well as combinations of it and dry tanks.It is flying speed at a low height.What was your most extreme situation?
I had some engine failures on two -engine machines.There were also thunderstorms in the tropics and difficult winter operations in North America, combined with a lot of traffic.How do you master dangers?
With calm, systematics and trust in your own skills and that of the co-pilot.Do you think of possible emergencies during the flight?O Yes, and how!
Especially on long-haul flights, I often picked up the emergency checklist and discussed a situation with the co-pilot.The emergency must be a constant companion.Which emergency scenario runs in the cockpit with a breakdown?
Pilots generally work according to the principle: power, performance, analysis, action.In German: Create enough thrust, observe flight performance and configuration, analyze the problem and then act.
It all has to go quickly.There is still time to study the checklists?Every professional pilot knows the first important points in an emergency.
Then after the checklist - whether electronically or on paper - is used.But you also have to be able to build on your knowledge that has always been processed.In emergency situations, today's pilots demand a lot more than that was the case thirty years ago.
What can the pilot do if the chassis cannot be extended?One of the pilots takes care of the navigation and the other takes care of the technical problem by making a checklist and common sense.If there is enough fuel on board and it lies within -rich, the maintenance is also contacted.
In most aircraft there is a lever with which the chassis is unlocked by means of a cable train, extended by its own weight and then locked again.However, the gates remain open, which are damaged in some aircraft types when landing.The second variant is delicate:
One or more of the chassis are blocked or can be extended, but not locked.In such a case, an attempt is also made to run out the chassis with the emergency lever.After that, a favorable speed is chosen and pushed through pushing or acceleration to lock the chassis.
If there is no success, there is only an emergency landing, in which you can pull out as many chassis as possible and then try to set up finely.Foam carpets are only laid if the fire fighting for the directly affected aircraft and other flights can be ensured.Are the passengers always informed about emergencies?
If it is possible for him, the captain should inform the passengers directly and confidently about an emergency situation.This can help to ensure that there is no panic and the Cabin Crew can make the preparations that cannot be hidden.How realistic is the training of emergencies in the simulator?
Very realistic.Cockpit layout, dimensions, optical, acoustic and tactile simulations are very close to reality.Many exercises can only be carried out realistically in the simulator.
In the simulator you always know subliminally that in the end nothing can happen.The scenarios in the simulator can be designed so complex that the last consequence for the crew will be washed out shortly.In a real emergency, the same considerations, recipes and aids have to be taken as in the simulator.
Why is the flight emergency call "Mayday"?" ( " Help me ! " ) .The international language of traffic in telecommunications was originally French.
Did you ever refuse to land or start?Jein.In the event of problems before the start, one speaks by radio to the company's operations center.
In flight, especially in the start or landing phase, you are dependent on yourself and often have to decide in seconds.The reasons are cross or tailwind, mostly in connection with slopes contamination (aquaplaning, snow, ice, sand), or previously from landed aircraft that block the slopes.How long can an aircraft stay in the air if all engines fail?
This is primarily dependent on the flight altitude.The pilot chooses an optimal speed and slides, due to the lack of idle thrust, slightly steeper than in normal descent to a long slope if possible.There is only one landing attempt and it has to succeed.
Such a flight can take over 20 minutes from 10,000 meters and extend over 150 to 200 kilometers.What is safer: an army jet or a modern passenger aircraft?It depends on the operational profile.
The pilot in the army jet is ultimately still available to save the rescue seat.For this, combat situations are much more dangerous than a trip in the very, very safe large -scale aircraft.What risk should pilots never take?
The risk of slipping a situation to them and that they are no longer master of the situation.And which risks are the most received?Because it is so difficult to set absolute limits in nature, these risks are mostly to be found in connection with the weather.
Does the autopilot lead to negligence?Every technique has advantages and disadvantages.The autopilot brings great advantages regarding work relief, comfort and economy.
Without him, the long -haul flights are almost inconceivable.He takes the pilot from flying routine work and makes it possible to solve technical problems that the on -board engineer used to do.When does it have to be flown without a autopilot?
If, for example, due to system failures, he no longer works reliably and in landings with strong winds or wind shears.Is there time for private conversations in the cockpit?Secure .
At waiting times on the ground or in the air, depending on the route length.With long night flights, it would even be unclear not to talk to each other.How important is the "chemistry" between Captain and Co-Pilot?
The chemistry in the cockpit can be decisive.Pilots are selected so that no completely extreme characters meet.Clear procedures ensure security, even if you are not exactly green.
Certain pairings are avoided in the planning phase.Did you ever be afraid in the cockpit?There is a whole range of fears that range from respect to panic.
I never had the latter.For me, fear always converted into a very incredible thrust and survival.I had the greatest fear of my own mistakes - and as a passenger.
The largest weak point in large -scale aircraft is.......still man.
This includes managers who do not take the laws of aviatics and thus physics seriously.Can an aircraft be landed if the entire electronics fail?Under favorable weather conditions, if the hydraulics works.
Why do aircraft almost always break apart in emergency landings in the same places?The weak points are obviously - whether wanted or not - behind the cockpit, near the wings and in front of the rear.What is the most dangerous airport in the world?
We did not classify an airport as "dangerous".There are those that are more demanding than others.These are mainly in emerging countries.
But Zurich, Salzburg and Geneva are not quite without.The safest place on the plane?Experience has shown that passengers have better chances of survival in the back and near the emergency exits.
And the safest plane.......
Is that on the dock.Movement represents a certain risk per se.The most important advice that you gave your flight students on the way?
That in addition to flying skills it also needs humility if you want to grow old as a pilot.The 69-year-old Werner Alex Walser flew army jets in surveillance squadrons and 32 years for the Swissair, includingAs Captain the aircraft types DC-9, Airbus A310, DC-10 and MD-11.He also worked as a flight instructor on the DC-9 and the A310.

Only pilot specialists in deployment / / the members of the airfield command 13 are currently serving them at the Meiringen-Unterbach military airfield.The training of these pilot specialists are always prepared by a long hand.
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Merz, designated boss of the airfield command 13, answers questions about the recovery course preparation of his unit comprehensively and precisely, including those after the parking spaces for the many soldiers who are entering with the passenger car: «Although all of our people together with the marching commandAlso the railway ticket, but we have to look for large parking spaces long before the service in the region that are free at WK period.»But this only happens in the second preparation, the exploration phase, three to four months before the WK, explains Merz.All meet the first phase will be introduced a good half of the year before the start of the WK when the airfield rod meets to update the order and the administrative preparation of the service.
"All commanders and rods come together on the occasion of the exploration," Merz continues, "the airfield commander announces the training goals, which must be trained in particular.This year this is the handling of the new Sidewinder steering weapon.During the three -day exploration, the troop accommodation must also be reserved, organizing the catering of more than a thousand people, ordering everything required for the WK and the considerable vehicle park.»
For Lieutenant Colonel Merz, an important part of the WK preliminary work is the information of the public, in particular the airfield residents: "With advertisements and press articles, we draw the affected population aware of the expected additional noise pollution, all households in Unterbach have received a letter."The airfield command 13 consists of Air Squadition 11 with the F / A-18 machines Hornet, their pilots and the approximately 200 airfield professionals, which are constantly employed.For the repetition course - or if the state government has to order for security reasons - the command through the Milita Personal Behavior is grows into an structure with well over 1100 to 1300 people.
This means that the nuclear groups previously consisting of professionals become the “Flieger Swader”, “Support Department” and “Logistics Department”, and the security company also moves in.The militia pilots with their Tiger aircraft F-5 form the pilot relay 8 in the department
Support now also take care of militia specialists such as aircraft mechanics for maintaining the machines, and the company's company of the logistics department ensures a well -functioning infrastructure with vehicles and machines.Here are the sappers that have to take on construction or demolition work in the WK.The milizler are trained by members of the "hard core" of the airfield command 13.Zirka 1,500 men "The airfield command 13 has a target stock of around 1,500 men," explains the commander Flieger Swader 13, "Female soldiers also serve here.

Airport Zurich AG is growing with Swiss / / "NZ. Zurich AG Airport AG last year benefited from the successful repositioning of the Swiss by Lufthansa and improved the performance values despite a few special expenses.
With the transfer of CHF 115 million to the noise fund, which also provides for an income split between the airport and the canton for the future, a turning point has taken place.As a former concession carrier, the canton of Zurich finances all noise liabilities that go back to a time before 2001.From the perspective of the shareholders, the airport, taking into account this topic, generated a net profit of 100.6 (I. 83.5) MIO Fr.
An expensive chapter from Swissair times was decided with the transfer of CHF 21.3 million to the estate administrator after he had successfully sued before the Federal Supreme Court.Last year, 22.0 million customers used Zurich Airport, 6.6 % more than in the previous year.The proportion of rapidly growing Swiss achieved 57 (55)% of the total amount.
Growth drivers were the transfer passengers (+11 %), but the Swiss (+4.5 %) were also travel -loving.In the first two months, the flight movements fell around 5 %, which transported 3.5 % fewer passengers than in the previous year's period.CEO Thomas Kern imposed a stopover and put up some investments to cushion the foreseeable break -in.
For the current year, a passenger decline of 3 % to 5 % and a profit reduction by 10 % to 20 % is calculated.Although sales in the Airside Center have reduced over 10 % in the first two months, but a double-digit sales increase was registered in the area, since the airport is becoming increasingly popular as a shopping center as a shopping center thanks to gradually improved accessibility.The business area
Non-Aviation turns out to be a welcome buffer to compensate for burglaries in the flight business.Kern showed understanding that the Swiss expects concessions because of the inhospitable situation, but he did not want to express himself in detail.Further report in the Zurich-Dättez W. (NZ)

There is a life after the crisis / / Hardly one industry is as crisis -tested as those of the airlines: the financial crisis is already the third in this decade after 9/11 and Sars.
Many airlines take off the market faster than used to capacity by temporarily shut down planes.SX.In 2008, over 1100 aircraft were temporarily shut down worldwide, as many as in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York.
This trend continues in the current year, because the airlines have learned from previous crises.The days when Airlines wanted to use their big overcapacity with ruinous price fights are over.Hardly a week goes by without hiring or thinning out airlines in order to be able to temporarily grown part of their fleet.
Air France / KLM shorten their offer in the summer flight schedule by a good 3 percent, especially in traffic with India and some destinations in the USA.British Airways takes its offer by 5 percent.Crisis does not mean a standstill.
This is how Delta spreads every tenth flight abroad, American Airlines is particularly thinning the route network within the United States ( - 9 percent).Even industry leader Singapore Airlines reduces the offer by 11 percent between April 2009 and March 2010 by temporarily breastfeeding 17 jets.Zurich is also slightly affected by this.
The evening connection will only be offered five times a week from April (with the exception of the Easter week).- Lufthansa reduces the capacities ( - 0.5 percent) significantly less than its competition.Thierry Antinori, head of marketing at Lufthansa, said at the Berlin ITB, crisis was not standing standstill.
Lufthansa reacts to the decline in passengers ( - 9.7 percent in January / February) by deleting individual routes or becoming non -stop connections to change connections.Because business travel traffic is more declining, Lufthansa is expanding the EconomyClass by 20 seats at the expense of business class in part of the Boeing 747 - 400 fleet.Where market shares can be won, Lufthansa also expands its offer in difficult times:
For example, especially in Milan with the new Lufthansa Italia, which is now offering eight destinations in seven countries from Malpensa and from April Rome, Bari and Naples.According to Antinori, Lufthansa Italia is going well, so that an expansion of the route network can soon be expected.Those airlines that grow in crisis and want to gain market shares include Arabic airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways or Gulf Airways, which open up further destinations with the new jets, some of which are adopted every month.
For example, Qatar Airways from Dauha plans new routes to Australia, India and Europe as well as the compression of existing connections.The latter also includes Geneva, which is now served five times a week.Many airlines do not dismiss the personnel that can be released in many places due to the reduction of capacities and the shutdown of aircraft.
Rather, overtime and holiday credit are removed (e.g. at Swiss).In some places, underemployment is bridged with short -time work, for example with the soil staff of Lufthansa or at the deep red AUA, which will introduce short -time work for around a third of their workforce from April 1.Once again, a number of airlines are creating newly arriving aircraft that they had ordered in the boom and now have to take over in times of crisis and have to fill with passengers.
At the manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, inquiries from airlines are increasing whether individual orders could be postponed or even canceled.After the merger of Delta and Northwest, the ordered Boeing 787 from Northwest are in the suspension.At Airbus, among other things, Air France asked for the postponement of individual jets, and even the large -scale recruitment Emirates apparently talks to Airbus about possible adjustments in delivery for their 58 large space jets
A380. War -conscious delay generally have been silent. In any case, the lawsuits of the airlines are silent that Airbus like Boeing, with the delivery of their two latest Jets A380 and B787, are already in arrears by more than a full year compared to the promised dates.On the side of the airlines, one is obviously not unhappy that the manufacturers are compensated for the late deliveries and can take over the new jets if the economy goes up again.Despite political obstacles, a further consolidation is expected in the aviatic industry.
At the ITB, of course, several analysts warned of overhanged acquisitions.The SWISS by Lufthansa, which is successful for both sides, is not the rule, but rather the exception and is thanks to a number of special circumstances (same culture, good management and good economy).In particular, the planned takeover of the AUA, which is far too expensive, is likely to be more difficult for Lufthansa.

The Schengen regime leads to changes at Zurich Airport / / For passengers within the Schengen area, the passport checks at Zurich Airport will fall away from next Sunday.Little changes for passengers - except for travelers to the UK.
You have to count on longer ways.The Schengen Agreement on the Swiss state border has been in force since mid-December last year.The next Sunday, the systematic personal checks in traffic with the Schengen area at the airports will be lifted.
Towards this day at Zurich Airport, the new infrastructure, which is built for Schengen, is completely put into operation: Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are separated spatially.It required investments of CHF 173 million from the airport company.The changes in logistics are considerable.
Schengen makes a lot more complicated for the airport, little changes for passengers.No ID checks several new new ones have to show the boarding pass when entering the Airside Center.Travelers after a non-Schengen country then pass pass control.
This control is eliminated for flights within the Schengen area.On the gate, however, when getting on the plane, the pass or an identity card is required.Arriving passengers from non-Schengen countries automatically run through the strict border control at the Schengen outside limit.
Entering from a Schengenland no longer have to identify themselves.However, the goods control remains for all incoming.As before, the passenger only has to remember the gate number on the way to the flight and follow the corresponding signaling.
The Schengen area includes Dock A, Busgates B 01 to 10 and the entire Airside center.The passenger does not have to worry about the separation to Schengen or non-trenches (see graphic).Only the signposts should be noted.
The airport company ensures the signage and makes the changes in an elaborate exercise in the night of March 28th to 29th.The passengers have to change the goal of London.
Since the Great Britain has rejected accession to Schengen, the majority of the London flights are processed in non-Schengen-Dock E or the bus gates.In a hurry, in a hurry, which leads to longer paths at Zurich Airport, hardly appreciate.The regulations for hand luggage still apply, nothing changes in the cumbersome EU security controls.
Liquids, gels and pastes are prohibited, toilet items must be placed separately on the tape in the standardized plastic bag, as well as laptops and everything that contains metal.The EU and BUND celebrate the implementation of the Schengen Agreement at the Swiss airports with celebrations to honor the association agreement.Jacques Barrot, Vice President of the EU Commission, Federal President Hans-Rudolf Merz and Zurich's President Markus Notter will spoke at the airport next Friday.

Cheap Camioneurs are a danger / / in the crisis, many trucks come to a standstill, TA from March 21st in his interview with Tagi explains Mr. Planzer that his company agreed with Lufthansa every day a special load of 1150 euros from Lugano to Frankfurtdrive .After tendering on the Internet, Lufthansa received offers from 420 to 810 euros.
This is economically questionable.However, the following thought is much more worrying.If someone can carry out half of the serious calculated price or below this transport, what for (un) safe vehicles and with how (un) qualified drivers should be carted through Switzerland and through the non -directional Gotthard tunnel?

New EU Law on European Airspace / / Strasbourg, March 25th.(sda)
A coordinated air traffic control, shorter ways for the aircraft and thus a lower CO 2 emissions: The EU Parliament passed the legislative package on the uniform European airspace on Wednesday.Switzerland is also involved in the project.
European airspace is currently managing sixty national control centers - twice as many as in the United States, with a traffic volume half as high.In addition, military restricted zones prevent straight -line flights from one airport to another.Although there have been regulations on the establishment of the “Single European Sky”, implementation did not progress.

Bus directly to Belp / / On Sunday, the first buses drive from the Bern bus station directly to Belp Airport.The timetable of the new line is based on flight times and changes every day.
The line belongs to the Libero Association.If patent Ochsner front man Büne Huber wants to be "picked away" by Belpmoos, he will have it easier in the future.The next Sunday the first Bernmobil buses will run between the Postbus platform at the main train station and Bern-Belp Airport.
The route leads the specially designed gas buses through the Kehrset bypass directly to the airport.The timetable of the new line is tailored to flight times: on working days there are three to four daily trips, and even six trips on weekends.
You can get on and out at the Eigerplatz and the tram stopover in Wabern.The simple, 22-minute drive costs CHF 5.80 without a half-tax subscription, with a half-tax subscription CHF 3.20.This corresponds to the normal Libero tariffs.
Three-year-old test phaseaut Wolf-Dieter Deuschle from the cantonal office for public transport must survive the new bus line a three-year test phase.
"Then we will see whether the operation of the line is worthwhile and whether the canton will continue to pay," he says.Bernmobil also hopes for high profitability.The company had prevailed in a tender against the PostBus operator and Marti AG.
According to director René Schmid, Bernmobil hopes that the buses will not only be filled from the city by airport visitors, but also by excursions."Finally, the area around the airfield offers ideal conditions for a walk or a bath in the casting pool or in the Aare," says Schmied.This applies especially to the weekend, where the most buses run anyway. ”Airport
Upgraded "" The new bus line is an upgrade of our airport, "says Mathias Häberli, director of the airport.Now the argument no longer applies that Bern-Belp is difficult to reach via public transport.Häberli hopes for higher passenger numbers with the city connection.
The direct connection is intended to expand the level of awareness of the airport in the entire Mittelland and beyond.The large inauguration festival, which will take place on the airport site on Sunday, should also help.Sebastian Steiner

Easy Jet and Aer Lingus rely on London Gatwick / / SX.
With Easy Jet and Aer Lingus, two airlines will offer new connections from Zurich to London Gatwick.Both airlines use British Airways from Gatwick to retreat to consolidate their position on the sixth largest airport in Europe.For Easy Jet, Gatwick is already the most important basis in the route network, the traffic of which is to be expanded by 37 percent in 2009.
Easy Jet only grows more quickly in Milan in order to benefit from the weakness of the Alitalia in good time.From April 2, the low-cost carrier London Gatwick will be connected with Munich, Zurich and Vienna.From Zurich, Easy Jet offers a daily flight to London Luton, which remains.
In Basel and Geneva, two flights from the orange low -cost aircraft start to Gatwick from the summer flight schedule.Easy Jet is a market leader in Geneva and Basel and now offers a total of 63 routes in Switzerland in the summer flight plan.The Irish Aer Lingus feels the crisis in its home market, which in the long run gives too little.
If Aer Lingus wants to survive independently, the airline has to grow outside Ireland.That is why the Irish airline in London Gatwick wants to establish itself as number 2 behind Easy Jet with eight aircraft until April 2010.From April 26, Zurich will also be one of the new destinations operated from Gatwick.
Aer Lingus still flies from Dublin to Zurich and Geneva every day.The London market is highly competitive in European air traffic.The passengers in Zurich should benefit from deep prices for flights to Gatwick, at least in the first few months.
Aer Lingus relies on the Swiss market that appreciates quality.Aer Lingus promoted around 150,000 passengers on the routes of Zurich / Geneva - Dublin in 2008.
These customers would also like to win for London.Aer Lingus, who has previously been able to assert itself against low-cost carrier Ryanair from his own country, has been looking for her salvation outside of a great alliance for three years.The focus is on 92 destinations in Europe, while 6 destinations are served in the United States on the long -term route.

Attention, Schengen!/ / fb.As of next Sunday, as already reported (NZZ 24. March 09), the people of the people in traffic with the Schengen countries will be lifted at the Swiss airports.Of this changeover at Zurich Airport, frequent flyers with destination London are likely to be affected.
Because Great Britain has rejected the Treaty of Schengen, flights to the United Kingdom are mostly handled by the Non-Schengen-Dock E, which can only be reached with the Skymetro.Hurried business travelers will therefore accept a longer route to the gate and have to calculate at least 20 minutes more time before departure.Sometimes passengers for non-Schengen destinations are also brought to the aircraft via bus gates B 22 to B 29.
- Because this changeover means a Herculean task for the airport, start -up difficulties can be expected.This despite the other official assertions.Airlines from the Schengen area are particularly affected by the innovation.
This includes the Air Berlin, the machines of which have so far mostly been handled in the e-dock, but are newly operated in Terminal 2.More than 90 percent of the flights of this airline and Zurich run in the Schengen area from time to time.Thanks to Switzerland's joining Schengen, Air Berlin can now also from Zurich

Aeroflot changes the general director from / / gho.Moscow, March 27th of the Russian airline Aeroflot, set the long-time general director Waleri Okulow and replaced him by Witali Sawelev, who used to be deputy minister of economics and most recently Vice President of the private conglomerate AFK Sistema.
Waleri Okulow is a veteran of the Russian aviation industry.In the approximately 12 years in which he led Aeroflot, Russia's largest aircraft converted from a Soviet society to a modern carrier who is a member of the Allianz Sky Team.However, Russian Transport Minister Igor Lewitin, who had asked Okulow in mid -March, had recently shaken one of his deputies in the Ministry on the chair of Okulow.
Criticism of expansion plansokulov initially did not agree to such a change to what is probably relatively insignificant in his view.The company's supervisory board, which is around 51 % in the hands of the Russian state, has now decided to stop Okulow.On Friday it became known that Okulow, who is a son-in-law of former Russian President Boris Yelzin, accepted the post of Vice Minister of Transport.
For a long time it was not clear whether Okulow replacement was actually at the agenda of the Supervisory Board meeting.Representatives of the National Reserve Corporation, which holds almost 30 % of Aeroflot shares and is owned by the Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev, had previously rejected Okulows.Leedew, however, told the Interfax agency on Wednesday, one day before the Supervisory Board meeting that the government had declared the arguments for Okkulow's arguments for the minority shareholders.
Lebedew stated that the government had given all the points that he had previously criticized.This includes the old and new expansion plans in Europe.After, for example, the purchase of Alitalia failed, Aeroflot announced this week to take part in a tender for more than 90 % to the Czech Airlines (CSA).
The largest shareholders are apparently skeptical about this project.Lebedew also mentioned the problem of the possible abolition of overflow fees for Siberia, which have to pay foreign airlines and which are an important source of income for Aeroflot.Russian airlines in Krisesawelev will definitely take on a difficult position.

How aircraft land climate -friendly / / The aircraft industry wants to save more fuel in the future and reduce greenhouse gases.A new approach technology and shorter flight routes are to help in Europe.
By Martin Läublibeim SAS-course 011 is about seconds.The Scandinavian Airlines machine glides towards Stockholm Airport.
No falling from altitude to altitude, as is usually common.The turbines of the machine run practically empty during the approach phase.The supervisor in the control room of Arlanda Airport, Mats Lindholm, is satisfied: "25 seconds late, that's okay." Continous descent
Approach, short CDA is called this approach procedure.In German, the experts speak of continuous descent.Niclas Härenstam from Arlanda Airport is enthusiastic when he talks about it.
The first SAS machine, a Boeing B737, ended up on January 19, 2006 according to the CDA process.Since then, air traffic controllers and computers have been conducting well over 5700 flights to Arlanda in this way.The airlines would have saved around 500,000 kilograms of kerosene, the aircraft engines out of 1.6 million kilograms less carbon dioxide (CO2).Has marked the environment in Geneva.
Not a waiting advantage of this new technology is the more precise flight planning than it is possible today.The country of land is set much earlier and the flight is then aligned (see graphic).This leads to almost optimal flight paths.
"There are no queues like that," says Niclas Härstam.And the organization on the ground becomes more efficient: less rolling time, less fuel consumption.
In Arlanda, around 10 to 15 percent aircraft land according to the CDA principle during bright traffic periods.Airlines aircraft are currently equipped with the CDA system, in addition to the Scandinavia Airline, including KLM, Lufthansa, Finnair, British Airways.Over twenty airports can be flown in with the new procedure today.
However, Arlanda is currently the only airport worldwide that already trigger the continuous descent at traveling height."The environment is now on our list of priorities, especially according to security," says Härenstam.European air traffic control EuroControl in Europe monitored almost 10 million flights in 2007.
In its global market forecast - that was before the financial crisis - the aircraft manufacturer Airbus expects the number of passenger flights to increase by almost 5 percent every year in the next twenty years.That means: the emissions would double during this period.Aviation today produces around 2 to 3 percent of global CO2 emissions, which is 12 percent related to global traffic.
The European Organization for Flight Security (EuroControl), the World Air Travel Association (IATA) and the global umbrella organization of air protection providers (CANSO) are relying on CDA technology.It plays a key role in the master plan of the three organizations, how fuel and emissions are to be effectively reduced in the future."The introduction of the system basically depends on how the airports, local flight protection and the most important airlines will work together," writes the environmental officer of Eurocontrol, Andrew Watt, in the magazine "Skyway". The European Aviation Industry has at the conference in Genevaannounced until 2013 to introduce the technology of continuous descent in around 100 European airports as a standard.
This wants to reduce the annual CO2 emissions by up to half a million tons.Defects in the capacity of technology should never be possible in Europe.Especially where there is a dense air traffic.
For example in Kloten."In the complex airspace Zurich, the application of a CDA process cannot be implemented without a loss of capacity," explains Maude Rivière from Swiss Air Troubleshoot Skyguide.The high volume of traffic, the limited space and the different arrival and departure process of the Zurich Airport make it difficult to plan the approach from a single source.
Speed regulations and a lateral and vertical staggering no longer work, according to German air traffic control.This is that proven "tools" that allows the air traffic controller to "pull as many planes as possible on a pearl line" and to lead to the final flight line at the right distance.The reason for the restriction:
In the CDA process, the speeds that apply to the respective aircraft type must be flown when the turbines work idle.And the approach to land results from the associated sink rate.In the future, the EU initiative of a "uniform European airspace", or SES, which is to triple flight capacity in Europe, could help in the future.
For this purpose, the EU has launched the Sesar research program, which should build a new system by 2020 to regulate air traffic in the air and in the airports more efficiently.No longer based on ground, but above all by satellite. "While the Schengen agreement on the ground ensures a limitless Europe, the sky over Europe is monitored by 47 national flight protection," says an Lufthansa report on sustainability.The consequence is: Each aircraft in Europe flies a detour of an average of 50 kilometers instead of “climate-friendly”, which makes a CO2 emissions of five million tons annually.
The air traffic control in the SES would no longer be organized along national borders, as is the majority today, but according to the traffic flows.For this purpose, air spaces are to be created, which include several countries.Switzerland, for example, is to become part of a common airspace of Central Europe.
In this way, the individual destinations could be flown in more direct.According to Lufthansa, the optimization of European air traffic control would be "the largest climate protection project in aviation in Europe". However, it will take a few more years.The operators of the Arlanda airport in Stockholm do not want to wait that long.
In four years, they plan, 80 percent of aircraft should land on the principle of continuous sinking.Image Martin Ruetschi /

France / / further job cuts at Air France-Klm.The airline Air France-Klm will intensify the job cuts with which it reacts to the economic crisis.
On Wednesday she confirmed press releases that between 2500 and 3000 jobs should be deleted in the two financial years 2009/10 and 2010/11.However, layoffs are not planned because it is planned to achieve the approximately 5 % of all places in relation to the reduction in a natural exit, some early retirement and a waiver of the extension of temporary employment contracts.Since 2400 jobs have already been deleted at the end of March 2008/09, there is a loss of around 5000 jobs within three years.
At the end of March, Air France-KLM announced that an operational loss of around € 200 million had occurred in the 2008/09 financial year.According to the “La Tribune” business sheet, the loss was almost € 650 million in the past quarter.The company is not only faced with a declining traffic volume ( - 9.4 % in March.)

Effort at Scandinavian / / After a miserable group result in 2008, SAS relies on saving and a partially renewed product.A takeover by Lufthansa is no longer an issue.
During a long time, the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was considered another takeover candidate for Lufthansa.In the meantime, however, calm has returned in this matter.Lufthansa boss Wolfgang Mayrhuber has repeatedly emphasized that his group was fully utilized with the integration of Austrian and British Midland from the management capacities for the next time.
And at SAS itself, one is now relating to a future in the Star Alliance, such as Group Vice President Per Moeller Jensen, responsible for the international routes, emphasized to the NZZ.Dealing of the group structure of the group structure last year is in the middle of the implementation of the restructuring package “Core SAS” (NZZ 4. 2. 09) announced in February when the loss was announced in February.
The majority of the measures are said to be implemented at the end of April.SAS is said to be a simpler airline simpler.The split -off into four daughters - SAS Sweden, SAS Norway, SAS Denmark and SAS International - is already reversed.
Moeller emphasized that the division was not completely in vain;The costs, but above all in punctuality, have made progress.The fact is that only SAS Norway has proven to be profitable in her local market, which has now been lacking in strong competition.
Incidentally, the last year for the group with a loss of 6.3 billion SKR.disastrous .The main cause Spanair (4.5 billion Skr.) Was started at the end of January, he was sold to Catalan majority owners. ”Core
What is crucial.The number of full -time employees of 23,500 last year will decrease to around 14,500;More than half of the reduction concerns Spanair employees.
It is also planned that SAS will separate as soon as possible from the participations to British Midland, Air Greenland and Estonian Airways.There are to be outsourced in further activities in the ground handling, maintenance and in the freight area.The goal is to focus on the Nordic market and business travelers.
These are targeted with an upgrading of the business class ("SAS Business Sleeper"), but also with the new introduction of the "SAS Premium economy" class.An inspection showed that on the long distances (Airbus A340) there is actually a significant gain in comfort, but that the advantages on the short -haul routes are exhausted in more booking flexibility and free catering.It will have to be pointed out whether the step takes place at the right time in view of the currently nasty economic circumstances.
The austerity measures include strong cuts in the route network.Two of eleven A340 are closed: The traditional route Copenhagen - Seattle has been served for 40 years.
Connections with China and India also fall away.The short and medium-haul fleet experiences a breakdown by 14 aircraft to 130. By November, 21 md-80 are to be pulled out of circulation.
However, some of these will be replaced.“Core Sas” includes savings of a good 4 billion SKR.However, the group also procures new capital in the amount of 6 billion SKR.
(CHF 560 million).The three Scandinavian kingdoms and the Wallenberg foundations, which hold 57.6 percent of the SAS capital, have given the corresponding commitments.Replacement for breakdown turboprops with the spanair affected by a disaster in Madrid last year pressed the high fuel prices in 2008 and the follow-up costs of the withdrawal of the entire fleet of Dash-8-400-Turboprop aircraft.
One remembers: In 2007, after three, all 27 units of this type had to be shut down after three land accidents in Aalborg, Vilnius and Copenhagen.The chassis had been bent after setting up.
The cause was in severe corrosion damage to the thread of the chassis.The majority of the aircraft had been on the road for SAS Denmark;Suddenly 30 percent of the capacity were missing here.
With the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier, an agreement on compensation in the amount of around 1 billion SKR.are achieved, partly in cash and partly as a discount on the new order of Jets of the CRJ900 “Next Generation”.12 planes were initially ordered;4 are already delivered.
Even if some will blush the nose in view of the slim tube of this 88-seat jet from Montreal: the seating comfort is, as a visual eye showed, it is decisively higher than in the tightly seated SAS-Boeing 737. The floor is somewhat lowered, the windows are oppositethe first versions have been enlarged.
And SAS will come to pass with her, some of which are still extremely “thirsty”, that the new CRJ900 is currently considered the most economical aircraft in your class.The dash -8 - 400 (left) (left) in 2007 after a series of chassis breakdowns and the - partly procured as a replacement - CRJ900 «Next Generation».

Flight prices in free fall / / Rahel Koerfgendie Aerospace industry suffers from the economic crisis:
The demand for passenger flights has broken down.This is pleased with the bargain hunters.With Swiss in May from Zurich to New York for CHF 549, with American Airlines to Los Angeles for CHF 813 - or with Air France to Beijing for CHF 723?
Flying was not that cheap for a long time.Especially with intercontinental flights, the airlines seem to want to undercut each other with dumping prices."Most airlines are currently flying big losses due to the broken demand," says Aviatik expert Jens Flottau.
"They sit on huge overcapacities." In March 2009, for example, the airline Swiss promoted five percent fewer passengers than in the previous year;The utilization collapsed from 81.1 to 74.4 percent.Other airlines are not better.
"The state of the aviation industry is desolate," said the head of the World Aviation Association Iata, Giovanni Bisignani.Because of the economic crisis, according to Iata, even fewer passengers will travel by plane than previously assumed.While the downward trend at the air freight may have reached the valley sole, passenger traffic decreases faster and faster.
Bisignani fears that this year the airlines will suffer $ 8.5 billion losses worldwide.As full as possible.The airlines have no choice but to keep prices deep to get the half -empty aircraft as fully as possible.
They don't earn anything at such prices, but without the cheap cheap tickets sold, their loss would be even greater.Swiss spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel confirms that the Swiss fumbles on the contingent of the cheapest booking class “Economy Saver” on poorly booked flights.Spontaneous bargains come to great bargains at the moment (see table). The Swiss also reacted to the decline in demand and thinned out the offer on eight intercontinental routes.
From the end of April to the beginning of July, the US cities of Los Angeles, Miami, Boston and Chicago are only flown six times a week instead of daily.According to Donzel, further capacity reductions are “quite under question”.Flottau is not surprising that the Swiss reduces the offer when there are flights over the Atlantic: “Airlines worldwide has expanded the offer in the United States incredibly in recent years.
That is why the situation here is particularly precarious. »A further measure of the Swiss is that one of the 15 large Airbus A340 - 300 from April 26 to July 4 will be“ shut down ”.The Swiss mother Lufthansa also pulled ten percent of its capacities out of circulation.This corresponds to 24 passenger and four freight aircraft.
Expert Flottau is skeptical about this step.“Fixed costs such as leasing interest rates remain the same for capacity reductions, even if the plane is on the ground.What only falls away are small variable costs such as kerosene or wages of the on -board staff.»
However, Flottau notes that these considerations would not apply if the planes have already been written off.Fuel.Since there is no improvement in demand at the moment, consumers can continue to hope for bargains.
The prices should even continue to drop in the next few weeks - "if the high Kerosinzuschlagen drops," said Flottau.The airlines soon used up the contingent of fuel, which they secured in 2008 at much higher courses - and then buy fuel at affordable prices due to the deep oil price.This has a positive effect on flight prices.
And Jens Flottau expects the prices to remain deep until the end of the year.But be careful: it is worth booking only a few weeks before the trip.Only then do the airlines adapt the prices to fill the planes.
Price difference.If you book your flight directly on the Airline website, you often pay significantly less.On the one hand, the advisory fee of the travel agency is eliminated, on the other hand, different basic tariffs can be used.
These are currently not cost -covering for the airlines.They are strategic tariffs with the aim of reducing overcapacity.Complex travelers book their flight better at a travel agency.

Super-Puma is a crowd puller / / a good 300 people gathered yesterday afternoon around the Mia area and looked up regularly.Then he came from east, the Super-Puma, whose landing she wanted to watch.
It was an impressive picture of how the pilot maneuvered the machine between the candelabers.And it was also interesting for the spectators to feel the violent wind stimulus.The trickiest task was followed: dragging the super-puma into the exhibition hall.
Kick because a car blocked the way to the helicop tag.This involuntary stopover did not disturb the audience.So they had the opportunity to take a closer look at the interior of the Super-Puma.

The former gate to the world of Swissair is threatened / / In addition to the slopes of the Dübendorf airfield, the former Swissair recording building is.The interior harbors treasures from his heyday.
However, a lot fell victim to conversions.By Pia Strawwangen-Brüttisellen.- Away from the polemic around the future of the airfield and forgot from the public, there is a silent contemporary witness on Dübendorfstrasse.
He witnessed the change of the airfield - and suffered from it.The inconspicuous building with a stately right of way was once a small goal to the world.From 1932, the Swissair employees finished their passengers until the civil aircraft flown the Klotener slopes from 1948.
Then the surveillance squadron (ÜG) of the Air Force took the premises.The Illnau-Empfertiker CFO André Bättig (FDP) knows the "ÜG building".He flies as a militia pilot for the Swiss Air Force.
«When entering this building you can feel the charm of the pioneering period.“The large hall with the counter windows, the gallery and the old lettering inspired the imagination.An immense picture of painted ceramic plates immortalized the Swissair at that time.
«I can still imagine today how flight operations prevailed outside.“The dark wooden builder and the doors of the Große Naal reveal that where Bättig now buffs theory with its air transport season 4, the restaurant guests once enjoyed culinary delicacies and the view of the airfield.However, there is not much left of this jewelry.
Between 1994 and 1996 the federal government renovated the interior of the building.Among other things, the restaurant buffet fell victim to this work.It gave way to a contemporary wall table.
Pietro Wallnöfer from cantonal monument conservation knows that this was possible because the monument preservation inventory of military buildings created by the army was only put into force in 2005.“Before that, the former Swissair handling building was not considered an object worthy of protection.»
And if the federal government wants to renovate buildings, he generally does not need a permit.Witness of an epochbrisant: The Dielsdorf architect Pit Wyss created an inventory report on the handling building in February 1994 on behalf of the municipality of Wangen.In it he relies on the cantonal planning and building law and recommends the protection of the "important witness of a political, economic, social and building artistic era".
Wyss also speaks of a “meaningful marker of Swiss traffic development” and “an architectural witness of recent cantonal history”.At the Wangen location community, it cannot be clearly determined why Wyss's recommendation was not discussed at the time."The community probably did not see itself as responsibility because the army was the owner of the building," says municipal clerk Christoph Bless.
It went into the country for over ten years until cantonal monument preservation held its protective hand over the construction in 2005.The Dielsdorf architect, who had created several inventory reports for the municipality of Dübendorf, cannot understand this."This is a hideous‹ Tolgge ›in the pure book of the federal government, canton and community," he says.
This building is the first on a Swiss airfield with a station character."And with the hall, the spacious restaurant with a terrace for the audience, the administrative rooms and the right of way, it includes all elements that still mark large airfield buildings today." By restructuring the army around the turn of the millennium, a number of military buildings.Together with the employees of the army of the army, Armasuisse, the cantonal monument conservation then determined the objects worth protecting and created an inventory.
Since then it has also been said at the cantonal level: Despite the changes made, the former recording building is an important contemporary witness that documents the Swiss civil aviation.Architectural historian Siegfried Möri advises the Armasuisse on inventory questions.
He knows: "The importance of this building was recognized in Bern, although it is quite struck by the renovations." Möri blames the interface between the army and the civilian authorities to protect the recording building earlier.The military and civilian construction were more separated at the time."The properties of the army were often regarded by the municipalities as" world "and exuberant in inventory - the confidentiality may have played a role." How long CFO André Bättig will prepare his flights in the former recording building is inthe stars.
The construction is inventory, but the treasures from the past are not certain before destroying.Because inventory does not yet mean protected.An inventory only obliges the owner to contact the monument authority in the event of a construction project.
Whatever the future of the Dübendorf airfield brings, first the various interests are weighed against each other: the protection of the buildings against the new use.The cantonal monument conservationist Pietro
However, Wallnöfer knows: "If a building is already" ramponized ", the chances decrease that the object can definitely be protected.If the army wants to convert, it will have to involve monument preservation in the future, »explains Wallnöfer.PICTURE

Dutch build flying car / / Amsterdam.- traffic jams are there to fly over.
According to this motto, selected drivers in the Netherlands should be able to transform their car into an airplane at the push of a button.The prototype of the flight car, which could go into series production in 2012, presented the PAL-V company not far from Amersfoort on Monday.For the time being, the intersection between a small helicopter and a three -wheel road vehicle should not be approved for private individuals.
"For the time being, the use of the flight car remains reserved for auxiliary services," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.Before possible use by Otto normal consumers, the authorities for road and air traffic would only have to develop generally applicable regulations for the use of air cars.(Sda)

"Helicopter are the stars" / / The MIA special show of the Swiss Air Force explains to the visitor what it takes to become professional military pilot or parachute reconnaissance.However, there is also information about what happens in the airspace every day. "We present the current air position that the air traffic controller can call up at the same moment," explains Peter Rytz, who is responsible for planning, coordination, operating and reducing the special exhibition at the MIAis .
On a large screen, visitors can impressively follow how to coordinate all military and civilian flight movements in Swiss airspace."We focused on the air area, the third dimension," says Rytz.The films that would also be shown over the weekend are purely for entertainment.
Films such as “Swiss Armed Force”, “Air Lumière” or “Grande Patrouille Suisse”. Young Exercising Exhibitors want to address boys so that they can get an idea of how training as a professional military pilot and parachutor looks.
It is shown, for example, that the specific helicopter or jet training only begins after three years of “Bachelor in Aviatics and Transport Pilot Training”."The training begins relatively early before the young people are 20," says Rytz.You would also like to use the exhibition that taxpayers can get to know the aircraft.
Something that you would not have the opportunity else in this way.The dialogue, on weekends with professional pilots with detailed knowledge, is also made possible during the week with people from the field of soil staff.F / a-18 flight simulator «
The two stars are of course the helicops, »smiles Rytz.With a Super-Puma, the day winners of the competition from Grenchen Airfield could make a passenger flight on May 6th.To test the skill of the visitors, there is a flight simulator of a F / A-18 in the hall.
"It is an amusement simulator that was created especially for exhibitions," says Rytz.A real simulator would need 20 by 20 meters.Also exciting the current uniforms that are worn depending on the use.
It can be seen, for example, a so-called “G pants”, which creates a back pressure and thus prevents the blood from sacking into the legs.The second area of the hall belongs to the civilian organization Aero Club Grenchen, with which the cooperation between the army and the civil aviation is presented."For example, you can send parachutists to Grenchen for their exercise jumps," said Rytz.

Queen of the air is naturalized / / Five years ago the super-connie came to Basel.Today the propeller aircraft worldwide is the last of its kind that stands out with passengers.
By Erwin Haasbasel.- The Super Constellation is the most legendary transport aircraft from the time before the Jets conquered the sky in 1960.She was the first airliner to flew non -stop from New York to Los Angeles and over the Atlantic.
Writers like Max Frisch have impressed the machine with the dolphin -shaped fuselage, four engines and three rear fins.She is worshiped as the queen of the air - most in Switzerland, because here the last machine of this type still lifts off.On May 8th marks the day for the fifth time on which the Super-Connie found a new home in Basel.
A club of enthusiastic fans had painstakingly finished flying the aircraft from California to Switzerland.Here it curves around Swiss air shows in the sky in summer and is a coveted picture object for photographers - now even with the Swiss sovereignty HB -RS on the rear.The club Super Constellation Flyers Association has brought the removed showpiece with a lot of front work so far that the Federal Office for Civil Aviation jumped over its shade in 2007 and allowed it as a large historical aircraft.
The crews - two pilots, a bord engineer and stewardesses - may not, commercially, promote people, provided that they have been club members for more than 30 days.Longly importing in the history of the Super Constellation Flyers, who absolutely wanted to bring a copy into the country, is peppered with adventures that the classic car all survived.A first attempt to transfer a decayed Connie from Santo Domingo to the United States succeeded nine years ago despite radio problems and the failure of a generator and an engine.
However, the machine was denied a US permit for passenger transport despite elaborate renovation in Arizona.In California, the Swiss enthusiasts around the Geneva pilot Francisco Agullo 2003 sensed a second chance: a Connie was a haggling.
The club struck and flogged to Basel in 2004 - despite problems.The wooden bug charu could hardly get out during the intermediate landing in Newfoundland.With luck, Connie came around a disastrous stomach landing.
The club was also lucky in Switzerland: the century snow in March 2006 forced Connie in Basel because of the load on the rear fin on the buttocks.Such incidents with material damage are not a problem for the association, since he has the most extensive collection of spare parts in the world in his hangar in German Lahr.
This also benefits him financially: Lufthansa, which now also wants to operate a Connie, needs know -how and material and supports the Swiss association.She booked 20 flight hours for training in 2009 alone. Www.superconstellation.orgbild

"New editions are going to the existence" / / For four months, Mathias Häberli has been director of Alpar AG and airfield chief in Bern-Belp.For him, the flood of additional security requirements is stressful.
Entering for support from the canton is provided.They have been airport director in Belpmoos since January.What is it like to kick in the footsteps of Charles Giant, whom you yourself call the "father of the airport"?
Mathias Häberli: The newspapers are full of texts on the financial crisis.This may be difficult prerequisites.However, I see my task as an airport director in this situation as a big challenge.
I want to build on the tried and tested.Again: how do you want to step out of Charles giant's shadow?For me, my predecessor is not a shadow, but in this change a great support as a delegate of the board of directors.
I am even glad that he is at my side with his specialist knowledge.What do you want to change at the airport?The airport has grown under various conditions in the past 80 years.
Now we have to bring a common thread into the whole structure.The systems are modernized so that processes within the airport can be made more efficient.To what extent do you feel the economic crisis?
We do not feel any changes in private and business jets.On the other hand, we register declines with the line and charter flights.It is clearly less booked than before.
We publish the annual report in June: We expect a black zero.What forecast do you make for the next few months?
That is hard to say .We are directly dependent on the consumer behavior of the passengers and do not know how to proceed.In the flight industry, we mainly plague overriding safety regulations.
In the past few months, a lot of new security requirements have recorded us.We are difficult to defend ourselves against them and have to implement them.The safety hysteria, which is rampant today, is no longer practice -oriented.
The regulations are increasingly designed at the desk, which entails enormous additional costs.Does it look that Bern-Belp also has to introduce short-time work after Lugano Airport?It doesn't look like it at the moment.
However, if the situation is still intensified, the introduction of short -time work must be checked.The airport is faced with an investment of several million francs: For the implementation of the safety regulations and the person controls according to Schengen Agreement, a terminal cultivation is required in Belpmoos.
You want to get to the canton for financing.How far are you ?In the future, passengers from the Schengen area may no longer be handled together with passengers of non-Schengen flights.
The clarifications regarding appropriate support run via Charles Giant.He has very good relationships with the canton.However, it is still unclear whether there will be support.
It is emerging that the Federal Council adheres to the introduction of the controversial supervisory levy.Airports and airlines are to pay the federal government CHF 18 million annually.What do you think ?
As a regional airport, these requirements go to the existence.We are already one of the airports that have the most difficult.We still don't know what the whole thing costs.
The information is often not differentiated whether it is a large airport like Zurich or a small one.Bern-Belp Airport is even the only one in a capital that is not subsidized.How do you want to cope with the upcoming costs?
In the past 20 years, the airport has managed to lead the airport privately without subsidies.In contrast to the railway, we are not subsidized by the state.This is difficult for me to understand because our added value in the economy is higher.
In our view, the cost -intensive requirements are sovereign tasks that are to be carried by the public sector.How do you want to integrate local politics into the interests of the airport?We clearly do not want to become a federal company and be dependent on fixed funds.
The airport is said to be managed in an entrepreneurial manner - as before.But if this continues with conditions, it will no longer be portable for us.We need support here.
In my opinion, some politicians do not register too little about the contribution the airport makes on public transport.In the broader sense, the economic sales in connection with the airport is around CHF 250 million and 1720 full -time positions.Why is it that many lines have opened in recent years and will be set again soon after?
When the crossair was integrated into the Swiss and Air Engadina and Swisswings bankruptcy had registered, we changed the course.We try to diversify and spread stretches with potential over several airlines.This is how we want to avoid the clumsy risk.
The problem is that foreign airlines come.However, they have no location preferences.Do not pay the route, turn away again.
Even with the charter flights, a machine must not be used so that the development potential can be used.Are negotiations for new airlines running?Yes .
It is one of my goals to bring one or two additional airlines to Bern.But this is only possible when politics, business and the tourism industry work together.Air France has been connecting the Swiss federal capital with Paris for two months.
What intermediate balance do you draw?As expected, the two daily direct flights have started.The average occupancy in the first two months was between 30 and 40 percent.
On individual days of the week, the occupancy is even over 60 percent.Interview: Rahel Guggisbergmathias Häberli has been head of Alpar AG, the operator of the Bern-Belp Airport.Last year he worked as a Chief Operating Officer for the company.
He studied mechanical engineering and specialized in aircraft construction and aerodynamics.The 41-year-old is a colonel in the general staff and lives in Belp. "My goal is to bring one or two additional airlines to Bern." "But it is essential to change a lot in Belpmoos."-Belp offers international line and charter flights.He reached the climax in 2000 with 240,000 passengers.
The CrossAir regional flight line flew around Basel-Mühlhausen three times a day.The only line flight from Belp is the flight to Paris today.In addition, in the summer season, numerous charter flights to the Mediterranean in Belp.rag

Crisis thwarts expansion plans from Airbus and Boeing / / Airbus and Boeing must drastically shut down their manufacturing rates in view of the economic crisis.The airlines withdraw orders, traffic demand drops, the procurement of credit for aircraft purchases becomes a problem for providers and the customer.
The message must have worked on Airbus like a shrill alarm signal.In autumn 2008, the airline Emirates took over the first of 58 fixed Airbussen A380 and immediately sent the Dubai - New York route.The new offer was not really going, and when the demand was once again a great deal of demand in the course of the global economic crisis, Emirates made an unpopular decision:
The plane is deducted from the prestigious route until further notice.Since then there have even been rumors that Emirates could pass on some of the fixed aircraft to the neighbor Etihad.Difficult credit procurement
Even such rumors are circulating about the industry star Emirates, then it must be really bad to be ordered to customers of the big aircraft manufacturers.For the suppliers, especially Airbus and Boeing, the financial and economic crisis threatens to have profound consequences.Your beautiful expansion plans, which you had already marked for the next few years, can confidently make you disappear in the drawer.
But that is far from the worst, because the airlines not only suffer from the decline in demand.It is very difficult for them to obtain loans with which they could finance their ordered jets because of the cash flow that has still not been gone between the banks.In any case, financial experts have drawn a dark picture for airlines and manufacturers at the annual Phoenix Aviation Symposium.
You expect everything to get much worse before it gets better.The greatest risk of Boeing and Airbus is at short notice that airlines cannot lose finished machines."A total of around 1,000 aircraft is to be delivered this year, but the financing is only secured for less than 50 percent of which," says Bill Franke, head of the financial investor Indigo Partners, to whose portfolio includes several airlines.
The order stock is not nearly covered.But not everyone, especially not representatives of the manufacturers, see the situation so pessimistic.Barry Ecclestone, head of Airbus North America, draws a different picture: According to him, the first half of 2009 is secured because the customers had already taken care of the financing before the banking crisis fully overtook.
For the second half of the year, Ecclestone relies on state export guarantees that could cover 45 to 50 percent of deliveries.Airbus and Boeing themselves would finance aircraft if customers would have no other option.So-called sale-and-lease-back shops are also a good way to overcome the problem.
"Overall, this brings us pretty close to the destination," says Ecclestone.Price decaying a second risk point are falling residual values and prices.A possible bankruptcy of the largest leasing provider Ilfc, which has around 1000 aircraft in its portfolio, could contribute to the decline in the residual values.
If these were suddenly and in the current location on the market, the pressure on the residual values would be even higher.But even without Ilfc, portfolios of almost 1,000 aircraft are already on the market today, according to Bill Franke.Industry experts also predict that the prices for newly ordered aircraft will drop drastically in this and next year.
Boeing has therefore already published a winning warning for the first quarter of 2009.In 2009, when it comes to prices for Airbus, the worst will be the worst that the company has ever experienced, writes, for example, Milene Kepler.In general, numerous in -house betting are already underway whether the number of new orders after deducting the cancellations at the end of the year is still positive.
It is completely undisputed that the order figures of the past few years are not nearly more achieved.In a way, the greatly dropped oil price is also problematic for Airbus and Boeing.At today's level, it can suddenly be attractive for the airlines to continue to drive older aircraft for longer instead of buying new ones, although their fuel consumption is higher.
"At low oil prices, the lower capital costs prevail as an argument against the somewhat higher operating costs," explains Robert Genise, head of the aircraft financier Dae Leasing, based in Dubai.A380 production on a small flamedie framework could not be less favorable, and in addition, the two large manufacturers can only give countermeasures very slowly.
Airbus has announced that the A320 family's short and medium-sized and medium-sized aircraft are produced in the coming year.But now it is also in the room to capture the high run planned for the A380 and to leave the installment on two aircraft per month.This means that even with a program that has been introduced for a long time, it can hardly be earned for Airbus the time when the production of the giant aircraft becomes profitable.
From 2010, Boeing plans to reduce the monthly production cadence of the 777 plant in Seattle from seven to five aircraft and should therefore also be released, even though nothing specific has yet been announced.Boeing is likely to be able to spread positive reports soon, after all, the first prototype of the Boeing 787 is slowly, but certainly now his first flight.But even for the 787 with its huge savings options for consumption: no airline is currently happy to take on new aircraft.

Private jet fleet of Lufthansa with Swiss management / / Lufthansa Group uses the doldrums in aviation for long-term investments in its premium offer.This includes its own private jet fleet, which is operated by Swiss Private Aviation, a subsidiary of Swiss.
SX.The economic crisis also leaves visible traces in the traffic figures of the Lufthansa Group.However, the person responsible for marketing and sales in the passage business, Thierry Antinori, knows the cyclical business of air traffic long enough.
Therefore, the financially well -positioned Lufthansa uses the current downturn for investments in the next upswing.Investments in the offers for the top customer segment are particularly striking.Four years ago, Lufthansa was the first scheduled airline to expand its services with rented business jets.
In 2007, Lufthansa encouraged the increasing demand for this individual and flexible form of travel under the roof of a global airline to build its own fleet.This summer, Lufthansa will already use seven own business jets.Passengers can now select between three versions of different size of the Cessna Citation (XLS +, CJ3 and CJ1 +).
Swiss quality from the outside are not recognized by the discreetly painted business jets as Lufthansa jets.Rather, Swiss enrollment stands out.The small but fine fleet is operated by Swiss Private Aviation.
This Zurich company employs 30 people and offers aircraft management and transport services in Europe after overseas.The company guarantees Swiss 100 percent subsidiary for Swiss quality, starting with the pilots, who had previously worked 90 percent at Swissair or Swiss.Otherwise, the specialized company can fall back on services and sales channels of the Lufthansa Group, with engineering and security, for example on Swiss, for fuel or in insurance to Lufthansa and when maintaining Jet Aviation.
To ensure that the needs can be flexibly covered, Lufthansa can use aircraft of certified partner companies such as DCAViation beyond its own business jet fleet.Aircraft sharing is also set up at Swiss Private Aviation.
Private owners of business jets can have flight capacity that you do not use yourself, marketed by Swiss Private Aviation.The latter operates these private jets according to the standards of Lufthansa.
Everything from a handder customer can either fly directly and at the appropriate time in the business jet of over 1000 airfields from destinations or can be transported to a hub (Frankfurt, Munich, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Geneva) and there into a long-haul jet of Lufthansa or theSwiss change.If you book a trip in Lufthansa's business jet, benefit from the one-shop concept: the IATA ticket with a LH flight number and fixed price guarantees all rights of a passenger according to the rules of the EU.Because of the individual components, these flights can only be booked via a special telephone number.
A calculator program has been providing information about prices since April.The passenger gets miles credited for his business flights and can use all of the First Class facilities at the Lufthansa destinations.This also includes a limousine service before and after the flights.

Marines off to the motorcycle training!/ / The elite troops lose more men in motorcycle accidents in the USA than in operations in Iraq.The US marines show fatal weaknesses on the home front.
At least those who are on two wheels.Hence the latest command: Töff training!Last year 25 Marines died in accidents on local streets.
There were 22 in war missions in Iraq. "The numbers were like a shot in front of the bow," says Admiral Arthur Johnson from the security center.The problem: "Many have too much adrenaline in the blood after returning from the front," says Feldweibel Brad Warner.
That brings them into dangerous situations in traffic.The security training has only completed 700 of the 18,000 crazy Marines.The others still have to, otherwise they will get a warning.
It is not easy for them: "We have such a superman complex," says Leutnant and helicopter pilot Algernon Clay.«I survived explosions and bazooka attacks.

Was flirt to blame for aircraft crash?/ / Continental flight 3407 plunged into a Clarence residential area three months ago, on the approach to the Niagara Airport of Buffalo.
All 49 people on board and one person died on the ground (in view). The traffic safety authority of the United States wants to re -illuminate the causes of the crash again.The suspicion: Pilot Marvin Renslow († 47) is said to have flirted with his co-pilot Rebecca Shaw († 24) on the approach.According to “New York Post”, the flight writer recorded the loose sayings between the two.
The unfalled experts suspect that landing was also poorly prepared.At that time, Renslow throttled the speed of the bombing machine too quickly on the landing approach-and could no longer correct his mistake.As a result, the air flow has completely torn off and the plane crashed, said the experts.

The difficult airport spagat / / Peter Schenkder Basel government council wants to combine environmental protection and business development in terms of EuroAirport.
Not everyone liked to hear that in Allschwil.Christoph Brutschin had no easy time when he visited the general meeting of the protection association of the population around Basel-Mülhausen Airport on Wednesday evening in Allschwil.Several protection association members criticized the Basel economic and environmental director, who had tried the balancing act between economic and residents' interests in his introductory presentation on the development of EuroAirport.
Nevertheless, Brutschin managed to stay in conversation with his critics - a concern he had emphasized in his introductory words.In some points he agreed to continue suggestions from the meeting.So he wants to check whether the wind speed of five nodes, in which the automatic state system ILS-33 comes into force, cannot be placed on ten knots.
The critical objection that the east-west slope was used by significantly fewer airplanes than possible at six percent, and promised to investigate this question.However, he was skeptical about the concern to extend the east-west runway due to the costs and the untried benefit.In this regard, too, he emphasized how important contact with the Als' and the southern Baden was.
«It is very important to me to prevent conditions like in Zurich.“In addition, he agreed to have the proposal checked to extend the main slope to the north.He also announced that an investigation into the expansion of the night flight bans required in both Basel is currently being created.
He rejected the concern to fix and plate the flight movements and instead spoke out for the steering of traffic, such as taxes.Here he sees further design options. Mobility.Brutschin had shown how important the EuroAirport and the associated mobility is, and argues: «Switzerland earns 40 percent of its money abroad.»
The charter flights had decreased as well as the freight volume that the number of flight movements had remained constant despite the growth of passengers due to larger aircraft.Jürg W. Tschopp had a positive news from the environmental department of the EuroAirport: Because of the bad economic situation, Korean Airlines will initially hire the flight of her noisy jumbos.

The most difficult repair was done / / the seven astronauts of the “Atlantis” space ferry managed one of the most difficult repair work in the world: They furnished the “Hubble” space telescope so that it is better than in 1990 at the beginning of its career in space.
Imagine a 19 -year -old car.Motor, gear and steering would be defective, battery and tank are empty.And to get to the next garage, they would only have to drive 600 kilometers.
Would you have it repaired?Hardly likely .But what if your car were the only vehicle on earth and it would serve science invaluable services?
Sure, the comparison lags.But he gives an idea a little, which is why NASA decided to start an expensive, complicated - and last but not least also risky - repair mission to the “Hubble” space telescope.Part of the debris in view
Travel of the “Atlantis” to the telescope, which is around 600 kilometers away, is not harmless - because in this “height” a lot of space scrap circles the earth.Scrap parts could damage the space ferry or even endanger astronauts during their external inserts during the repair work.Last Wednesday evening, on the second day of the “Atlantis” mission, it was already shown last Wednesday evening.
On their radar screens, specialists from NASA floor control recognized a part of around ten centimeters tall, which flew towards the room ferry.The debris part came from a Chinese satellite that the Chinese military had shot down in 2007 in a somewhat rash rocket test.The NASA engineers asked the Astronauts of the “Atlantis” to prepare an evasive maneuver.
Finally, the debris piece slid past the spatial ferry around three kilometers away.Fortunately, the actual repair work on the space telescope went without such precarious incidents.Last Thursday, the astronauts John Grunsfeld and Andrew Feustel built a new “Wide Field Camera 3” camera.
After that it went very quickly: Until on Sunday they replaced all six gyroscopes - the swing gyros who align the telescope - changed a computer, repaired the spectrographs, which enables looks in the area of ultraviolet radiation, built up and repaired another cameraEven the defective previous camera of the telescope.Fine work in glove astronauts describe such complicated work as "Brain Surgery" - "Brain Surgery".
Overall, the service people in space only had to solve 111 screws and brackets in the repair of the spectrographer - all with their chunky room gloves.Yesterday the exchange of various batteries was due to the fifth and last outside use.So far, “Hubble” has caused costs of $ 6.9 billion (CHF 7.7 billion).
Thanks to the current “Atlantis” mission, the 11-ton telescope will remain in operation for longer than originally hoped for-probably until 2015. Then replacement will be provided: The more powerful follow-up telescope “James Webb” is scheduled to serve in 2014 in spaceto record .
The “Atlantis” crew remains the return flight.NASA had noticed damage to the heat shield after the start.The dents, caused by foam pieces torn away by the main tank, were classified as irrelevant.

Air turbulence are more dangerous than lightning strikes / / About every three years the flash strikes in a passenger plane - usually without consequences.A lightning strike that was not excluded as a possible cause of the crash of the Air France jet cannot actually harm a modern passenger jet.
A plane is a Faradayscher cage like a car, explains the spokesman for the Cockpit Association, Jörg Handwerg: The lightning is looking for the shortest way to the floor and hardly get into the interior.The technology is so protected that it is almost never affected in the event of a lightning strike, the flight captain continued.
«As a rule, nothing happens.»Since there are up to three electrical systems working independently on board depending on the aircraft type, an electricity-taled failure is extremely unlikely.There are also emergency systems:
The Airbus A320, for example, has a turbine in a wing that is folded down and can then generate electricity using the flow wind.In a thunderstorm, the turbulence for a passenger plane is a bigger problem as lightning.Therefore, the pilot also tries to fly around the storm fronts.
He is not aware of any case in modern transport aircraft in which a lightning strike led to a crash.According to statistics, a flash of lightning strikes a large passenger jet about every three years.Small machines in regional traffic are affected more often because they are traveling at lower heights.

The thunderstorm is hardly the cause of the plane crash / / turbulence or ice particles are more dangerous for aircraft than lightning.But the weather was hardly the only cause of the crash of Airbus.
By Barbara Vonarburgein Glice Light, a loud bang, the light flickers in the aircraft cabin.That was a lightning strike, the pilot reports to the frightened passengers.Such an event is very rare, writes Lufthansa, "even for frequent flyers, the likelihood of a lived lightning strike is extremely low".
However, experts estimate that on average, every transport aircraft is hit by lightning once a year (TA from Tuesday).Most lightning in the atmosphere would run from cloud to cloud, explains Harald Schwarz, professor of high voltage technology at the German Technical University of Cottbus."If you fly through a thunderstorm, it is likely that you get into such a discharge channel." The flash strikes, flows up to 100,000 amps over the airplane shell.
"That should usually not harm the plane," says Schwarz.However, it is difficult to estimate where the electromagnetic field connected to the lightning current can penetrate.A German report on the topic of “air traffic and weather” comes to the conclusion that lightning “a certain residual risk”.
Signal lines or computers on board could be disturbed or even fail."When an aircraft at Düsseldorf crashed on February 8, 1988, the plane was previously hit by lightning." Nevertheless, my experts, a lightning strike as the cause of the Airbus accident was rather unlikely."I would practically exclude that," says Thomas Hauf.
He is a professor at the University of Hanover and works on an EU project that is supposed to warn pilots of dangerous weather phenomena.Perhaps turbulence could have brought the Airbus into difficulties, speculated.There are particularly strong turbulence in storm clouds in which the air rises.
The forces that work on an aircraft could exceed the structural limit values in individual cases, the report "Air traffic and weather". Normal day with normal weather, the tropical winds do not reach the maximum, but less than 20 meters per second, in ourLoad levels can be 50 meters per second."The thunderstorms with us are more spirited, they are more or less limp in the tropics," explains Hauf.In addition, there were no extreme conditions over the Atlantic.
"It was a normal day with normal weather," says Thomas Gertz from the German Aerospace Center (DLR).There were no exceptionally strong thunderstorms and not a lot of lightning.A pilot usually recognizes the dangerous areas on its weather radar and can fly around the thunderstorm cells.
"However, it doesn't work," says the DLR expert.Because the clouds often pile up near the equadition, up to 17 kilometers high.But even near thunderstorms, unexpectedly strong turbulence can occur.
A passenger died on a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo when the plane suddenly sagged when a storm flying around."We meteorologists speak of convective turbulence," says Hauf.The thunderstorms can stimulate air waves in the atmosphere, which are pushing and breaking in a similar way to water waves.
If an aircraft randomly into such a zone, there may be an abrupt height changes of a few hundred meters."A phenomenon that has not yet been properly understood," says the expert.On night flights through the thunderstorm zone on the equator, however, a danger lurks: so -called anvil clouds, which consist of small ice particles.
In contrast to the thunderstorm cells, the pilot cannot recognize this on his radar, explains Hauf.Perhaps ice particles that had been sucked in by the engines would have caused difficulties.The fact that this could be a problem was known from night flights on north-south routes.
Perhaps the poor visibility played a crucial role in recognizing or misunderstanding this danger, says the meteorologist.However, the experts do not believe that the weather was solely to blame for the Airbus crash."An airplane must be able to fly even in bad weather," says Hauf.
And his colleague Gertz says: In the past, one has almost never found a only cause of the crash of an aircraft.«There was always a chain of stories that led to the catastrophe.

Lufthansa is looking for growth markets / / nz.The airlines are constantly active in a border that connects people and will continue to grow with a view to opening countries such as China and India for the foreseeable future.
The Lufthansa CEO, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, illustrated this global dimension on Wednesday in a presentation in front of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce in Zurich as follows: It gives him great pleasure, as an Austrian who has a German airline that is pleasing with her sister SwissIt is good to speak to America in Switzerland in front of guests with special interests.Because Lufthansa also sees itself as a company with vital interests in the USA, where 10,000 people are employed at 52 locations.
In his presentation, Mayrhuber stated that focus on effective customer needs, good geographical diversification of the risks, initiatives in emerging markets such as China and also the striving for the "critical size" are important elements of Lufthansa strategy.As far as positioning in Europe is concerned, the integration of Austrian Airlines and probably British Midland are the next steps, which the Lufthansa Group CEO did not specially mentioned;Rather, he put weight on the fact that the Polish market still had many unused development opportunities.
In any case, the European market is still too fragmented;It might be read from this vote that Lufthansa would certainly be interested in the Polish lot;The lot is already a member of the Star Alliance with Lufthansa and Swiss.
With regard to the "Open Sky" agreement between the EU and the USA, hope sounded that the parties could soon agree on an arrangement to overcome the antiquated bilateral traffic agreements.In this context, Mayrhuber set up the thesis that the three global airline alliance Star, OneWorld and Skyteam had promoted competition in recent years and not inhibited.For transnational mergers, at least outside of Europe, you wait in vain, even though they would be the next logical step.

Flight tickets should also apply to Glattalbahn / / switch from the plane directly to the tram without having to solve a new ticket: This idea, born in the circle of airport hoteliers, is now seriously checked by the transport association.
By Christian Wüthrichwallisellen.- If you arrive at the Zurich airport, you need your own car, good friends, a taxi or public transport to continue to the hotel, a company visit or home.To date, the latter requires buying a separate ticket.
Now the Glattal (VBG) transport companies are putting up a suggestion that makes you listen: flight tickets should also be valid for the Glattalbahn. "The idea was brought up to us by individual hoteliers," says VBG director Andreas Flury.
Since line 10 of the Glattalbahn started operating last December, the areas between the airport, apawic park and Oerlikon have been particularly well developed.There, some hotels would soon no longer need their own transfer buses to pick up their guests from the airport, Flury suspects.The Novotel, for example, is only a few steps away from the Lindberghplatz stop, and the Hotel Renaissance can also be easily reached via the Glattpark stop.
The ZVV welcomes the idea in public transport universally valid flight ticket to the airport operator Unique on open ears.Media spokesman Marc Rauch points out that Zurich Airport is now one of Switzerland's best -closed facilities."We therefore welcome every prison to further link the various modes of transport." The idea of the flight ticket for the Glattalbahn is already on the table at the Zurich Transport Association (ZVV), as media spokeswoman Beatrice Henes confirmed yesterday.
"Everything that has to do with tickets and tariffs is in the sovereignty of the ZVV," she emphasizes.However, the proposal is welcomed that the airport and the other positions involved are now being welcomed to check it.«A convincing solution would simply have to be found.»
It is not very likely that a flight ticket will only be valid for the Glattalbahn.Since there are no more tickets for individual routes, but only zone tickets, a plane ticket would have to be valid in addition to the Glattalbahn on the other public transport - mainly bus and S -Bahn - says Henes.Before the train journey with the boarding pass will be allowed, air travelers still have to be patient.
The VBG therefore first set up coinuters for Euros at the airport.Bahnbau comes up to the plan.- The Valaiseller building board member Bernhard Krismmer spoke of the visit of a “century building” when he welcomed visitors to the construction site tour along the third stage of the Glattalbahn on Wednesday evening.
Around 140 interested parties accepted the invitation of Andreas Flury, overall project manager of the Glattalbahn, and climbed in three buses that were ready."With our tours, we have great interest," said Flury.In the past few months he has already been able to lead around 800 people over the building sites in Dübendorf, now the Valaisllers have been invited.
The first stop was at the television studio stop in the Opfikerpark, at the end of the artificial lake, where the Glattalbahn has been wrong since December 2006."After a after -work bath, you can drive back to the Glattalbahn in the swimming trunks in seven minutes back to Valaisellen train station," said architect Rainer Klostermann.He also explained the interaction of railway construction and urban development, which is also evident in the center of Valaisellen.
There you also stopped and saw how the center development takes place right next to the tracks of the Glattalbahn.Engineers gave a lecture on the complicated construction of the new passenger underpass, and explained that from now on the completion of track 1 and a new Perrond roof can be started.The population shows understanding of the parking deck 12 in the smooth center, the crowd of visitors gave an overview of the construction of the 1200 meter long viaduct with the new access to the shopping center.
Although you were stopped by the winter frost for two months, you would also be fully on schedule here, it was insured.The visitors were amazed for the fact that work is made twice as quickly as usual.And some people were glad that it has to endure the worst noise for less long.
In general, those present showed a lot of understanding.Even a resident who directly at the train station, almost in the middle of the construction site, lives: «The farmer doesn't bother me so much;Our bedroom is on the noise -facing side, »said Olivier Haffter.
"I think it's great that the Glattalbahn comes, even if the viaduct is more massive than it looked on the animations," said Felix Glättli at beer and sausage before going back to the Valaiseller parish hall by bus.(CHW) Stop TV studio: Here the bathing lake is opened up in the smooth park.
Wallisellen train station: Engineers explain the status of the work.Park deck 12 in the smooth: a viaduct will create a new access.

With a plane ticket free to the airport?/ / Zurich .- Travelers who fly or land at Zurich Airport should not have to solve a separate ticket for the return trip by train or bus.
The Zurich Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) is also worth checking this idea of the airport hoteliers.But nothing has yet been decided.Not even for which zones or regions the flight ticket for train, tram and bus should apply.
The validity of the plane tickets on the entire ZVV network would be best.It is also unclear which document who books online who book online would have to show for a control.The ZVV now wants to negotiate with the ticket exhibitors and composite partners.
It should also be clarified whether they would be willing to finance the additional validity of the plane tickets.Airport Zurich AG (Unique) is also interested in the fact that flight tickets could in future apply to rail, tram and bus trips."We are a significant traffic hub and welcome every relief for travelers, employees and visitors," said unique spokeswoman Jasmin Bodmer.
24,000 employees work at the airport.And 43 percent of all people who come to the airport or leave him do this by public transport.At the airport there are 600 buses and 300 entrances every day.

No traces of AF 447 / / All traces found so far proved to be wrong.The chances of finding one of the black boxes are classified as minim by experts.
From Walter Jäggidie, the first objects recovered from the sea at the suspected accident site turned out to be driveled yesterday, an oil track as a pollution from a different source.The Brazilian authorities admitted that both come from the Airbus sought - whereupon the French Minister of Transport warned them not to spread any premature reports.So there is still no reliable knowledge of the exact place where the Airbus A330 of the Air France airline crashed on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on Monday.
There were 228 people on board.The French marine research institute Ifremer has now diverted its ship Pourquoi Pas from a research trip to the Azores to the suspected crash site.The manned small submarine nautile, which the Pourquoi Pas carries, is then supposed to mount one or more black boxes.
Blackboxes do not send the data writer far, which are more than 4000 meters deep on the sea floor, send a location signal.This ultrasound signal extends only 1500 meters, the reception radius of the nautile is 200 meters.Even if the Pourqoui PAS succeeds in catching a signal with probes, it will be very difficult to recover one of the black boxes (which are actually strikingly orange).
After the crash of a charter plane in front of Sharm Al-Heikh in Egypt 2004, the French Navy had managed to find the black box that lies at a depth of 1000 meters, which was already considered exceptional.The flight data writers would not be intended to find swimming times after an accident on the water if they were floating.According to various accidents, including Swissair 111 - this also found that.
Already in July 2005 they encouraged the safety regulations for flying.The draft law stipulates that the flight data writers have to "swim on the water unlimited".However, the US Transport Ministry has not yet carried out this order.
After the disappearance of the misfortune flight AF 447, the question also arose as to why the air traffic control could not exactly determine the scene of the accident.There is no radar over the oceans, but it is definitely air traffic control.The pilots receive the instruction by radio or a kind of SMS to fly a certain course at a certain amount and to report to certain reporting points in a certain minute.
Compliance with these instructions from the air traffic controllers cannot be observed directly.All aircraft are now equipped with satellite navigation (GPS), the pilots can constantly determine their own position.However, the aircraft cannot be actively located by the GPS satellites.
However, the automatic data systems on board can be programmed in such a way that you regularly report the GPS position using short-wave or satellite radio.Such messages, as far as they are ordered, have mostly become the airlines and not to air traffic control.The search and emergency service via satellites is also well organized.
Small transmitters that are automatically activated in an accident send a message to a satellite.The Sarsat system, which was created for this purpose, received more than 500 alarms of incredible ships and aircraft in 2007 and forwarded them to emergency services.Sarsat also alarmed the authorities when a small aircraft from the Flight Group Seeland fell on July 13, 2007 into a corn field.
Air France replaces equipment. Every yacht and every freighter sarsat emergency end, but commercial aircraft does not have to be equipped with it.The international regulations assume that the Blackbox is sufficient.Air France, however, announced that the devices for measuring the speed should be replaced in all Airbus machines on medium and long distances.
It is believed that the crashed Airbus in the storm had the wrong speed.Image franco

How else with the Dübendorf military airfield?/ / Some want to see aircraft in Dübendorf in the future.Others dream of a racetrack or an innovation park.
Today the canton presents the first results of test planning.By Walter von Arborgdübendorf.- The clouds hang deep on this cloudy afternoon.
It is December 16, 2005. drizzle envelops the site of the military airfield in aqueous gray.A F / A-18 rolls to the start with deafening roar.
Actually an ordinary winter day in the upper Glattal.If it weren't for a few hundred covers in thick coats and armed spectators on the site with umbrellas and cameras.And did not hold one of the fighter pilots a transparent from the cockpit, on which it says: "Goodbye Dübendorf".
After 90 years of intensive use by the Air Force, it is the last time that a fighter plane lifts off the Dübendorfer piste.An era comes to an end .Air Force is in installments
In return, there is a 265 hectare area, which is hardly used anymore.Only the hum of the legendary JU-52, the crackling of military and rega helicopters, the squeaking cars on the TCS test track, the roar of private aircraft during the WEF and every second summer ensure tubes fromMusic sizes like the Rolling Stones or Madonna.Nothing should change by 2014.
Until then, the army wants to use the space and tolerate occasional civilians.What comes afterwards is open.And highly controversial.
As soon as it became known a few years ago that the Air Force plans its further future without Dübendorf, ideas for reuse shot like mushrooms.According to a Formula 1 slope and the Zurich entrepreneur Nick Beglinger, car lobbyists dream of a zero energy city.Some sympathies in the aviatic industry enjoy the proposal, the infrastructure for civil flying or at least for aviation companies.
And FDP National Councilor Ruedi Noser Femelt for his idea of an innovation park.The federal government's dismissal policy is in full swing.Meanwhile, the army laves and pushes the final decision in front of it.
It was initially said that in autumn 2009 the definitive stationing concept would be presented to the Federal Council, the decision should only be made in the course of next year because the Federal Council has not yet decided on replacing the f-5 tiger.Defense Minister Ueli Maurer recently confirmed that the fighter jets will not return to Dübendorf.However, he explicitly left the question of how it is with the helicopters and the area aircraft.
This delay policy is particularly annoying those who have been wanting military flight operations to the Pfefferland for years.One of them is the Dübendorfer SP cantonal councilor Peter Anderegg.With advances in the cantonal parliament, he tries to make the government council legs legs.
This currently has a so -called test planning.Representatives of the federal government, the canton, the planning group Glattal and from neighboring communities sit together and do the new use for the oldest airfield in Switzerland at all.There is a risk of traffic collapse this planning not only play the various ideas put into discussion, but also a concept from 2002.
The neighboring communities of Dübendorf, Volketswil and Wangen-Brüttisellen had invited the federal government, political parties and associations as well as spatial planners to workshops.The aim was to find out that a large part of the airfield site could be built over, without the area that was already densely populated.It became clear: a maximum of a third of the total area.
And that also in the event that the ring railway leading from Bassersdorf via Brüttisellen and the Dübendorf train station to Stettbach.And then there is the thing with property rights.Quite a few private areas look at the largest unsurpassed area near the Zurich city center and the Kloten Airport.
Because the military airfield belongs to the federal government, there is no way past Bern.Picture Swiss

Pilots sentenced to fines / / Bellinzona, June 8th.(sda)
The Federal Criminal Court sentenced two Swiss pilots to land in Pristina (Kosovo), which was not regulated by the prescription, to conditional fines of 90 daily rates for CHF 175 (captain) or 65 daily rates for CHF 200 (co-pilot).It was guilty of the duo of the negligent disorder of public transport.Single judge Peter Popp supported the prosecutor's charges with his judgment.
The two pilots would have been waiting for the starting maneuver for too long, Popp said on Monday when the judgment was pronounced in Bellinzona.The pilots must cover the procedural costs of around CHF 18,000.Hansjörg Stalder, the federal prosecutor of the federal government, had accused the two accused of having jeopardized the life of around 200 passengers when landing in Pristina.
The defenders in turn pleaded for acquittal.The two 34 and 39 -year -old pilots had not made themselves punishable in the incorrectly carried out approach maneuver.Almost with a starting plane
The incident occurred on October 21, 2004.The airfield of Pristina in Kosovo was fog when the MD-83 of the Helvetic Airways was to land on board with 165 passengers.Despite the adverse weather conditions, the commander left the tax to the co-pilot.
The latter brought the plane to a dangerous flight when he tried to fly around a cloud.The captain issued the subsequent command to start the start, as judge Popp stated.Therefore, the machine almost collided with 28 passengers on board with a ready -to -take German plane.
With a reflex -like alternative maneuver a few meters above the ground, the impending collision could be avoided.However, the MD-83 touched the slopes with a tip of the wing.The wing was damaged, individual parts fell onto the runway.

Harzed consolidation of over -regulated aviation / / nz.( Kuala Lumpur )
A standard meeting that regularly gets on the tapet at the annual meetings of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the missing structural cleanup.Since the business prospects are currently very crazy and the compulsion to restructure is correspondingly great, one would be the logical step towards reducing chronic overcapacity.Air France's merger with KLM and the takeover of Swiss by Lufthansa have clearly shown that such a lot can be obtained with such profound strategic decisions.
In this regard, the endurance test for the airline team Delta Airlines / Northwest is still pending.Although Christoph Franz went with the Swiss Ebendiesen from success, he remained skeptical at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur that a number of mergers could now follow.The airline industry is currently stuck between the "old" and the "new" world, so to speak.
Furthermore, bilateral traffic agreements and hard property clauses for cross-border mergers-outside the EU space-hardly form barriers to be overcome.The Americans, for example, stipulate that foreign investors can control 25 % of an airline in the maximum.Robert Milton, the long-time head of Air Canada, said ironically, two large US airlines could now be bought for $ 700 million.

Return to armaments policy normality / / After the turbulence around the armaments program 2008, the National Council clearly approved this year's procurement.Only a simulation system for the house fight met with criticism.
Bern, 8th in the National Council about the procurement of new armaments for the army, the political fronts are usually foreseeable: here the Greens and the SP, which reject arms from pacifist and army -critical considerations.There the center and right parties that help the programs to make a clear breakthrough.
After the SVP initially rejected the armaments program in order to accelerate the political end of the then Minister of Defense Samuel Schmid, the National Council returned to the objectivity and armaments policy on Monday: The SVP supported the armaments program of its Federal Council Ueli Maurer unconditionally and assumed the template to oneComfortable majority of 122 to 55 votes, which means that the business goes to the Council of States unchanged. "Apparently" modest program dates in 2009 is modest compared to other years: in 2008 Switzerland had to be upgraded by the army, requested CHF 917 millionDefense Minister Maurer for Parliament for 2009 material procurement worth CHF 496 million.
As Maurer admitted in front of the National Council, his department anticipated the upcoming partial replacement of the fighter planes, which should cost around CHF 2 billion.Against this background, Hans Widmer (Sp., Lucerne) spoke of a "only apparently modest" program.In the area of mobility, the armaments program provides for the procurement of light medical cars and the equipment of 5 military airfields with a new approach system:
Both projects in the council met with all political groups - apart from the Pacific Greens, which the armor program rejected from principle anyway.Jakob Büchler (CVP., St. Gallen) emphasized that the procurement of the almost CHF 300 million in the management and monitoring of aircraft is necessary in that the previous 40 -year -old technology had to be replaced.On the other hand, the procurement of a simulation platform, which expensive CHF 123 million, with which the use can be practiced in built -up terrain.Josef Lang (Gp., Zug) did not recognize a scenario where a house fight could occur in Switzerland, and therefore warned of preparing a day -to -day participation in war missions abroad.
Hans Widmer made the approval of the entire armaments program on the fact that the SP faction depends on the disposal of the platform, since he feared that the training in the house battle was an army deployment against its own population.However, an application for deleting the facility failed with 122 to 58 votes, after Maurer guaranteed, never used the army against, but always only to protect the Swiss citizens.Finally, the Federal Council calculations also caused discussions on Monday, according to which the armaments program with 89 percent of the procurement volume in Switzerland was effective.

The international aviation in severe turbulence / / the international airlines will suffer from $ 10 billion in the size of the IATA 2009 industry association.The recession is now completely over. NZ.
Kuala Lumpur, 8th Junidie Aviation is susceptible to a variety of dangers, as recently the tragic crash of an Air France long -distance machine has recalled over the South Atlantic for unexplained reasons.The traveler becomes aware of another danger if the temperature is recently taken away before climbing the aircraft.
If you have a fever, for whatever reason, you have to expect difficulties.The struggle against the spread of the swine flu (A / H1N1 virus) was also discussed at the 65th anniversary of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Kuala Lumpur.Burglary in sales with a double -digit installment view if the already weakened industry is now still hit by an epidemic, as Sar's lung disease in 2003.
The position description of Iata General Director Giovanni Bisignani was also so bleak.The industry organization continued to shrink to 226 (I. 234) members;Over 50 airlines have disappeared from the market worldwide within eighteen months, with the business model of a low -cost aircraft in particular suffered by shipwreck on intercontinental routes.
For the current year, IATA expects the return of the proceeds to be $ 15 % and $ 80 billion to $ 450 billion.The aggregated loss is forecasted with a little changed, $ 10 billion, with accounting the capital costs and assuming an oil price of $ 56 per barrel.After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, sales had "only" 6 % across the sector, and the relaxation had rapidly used at the time, which almost nobody expected this time.
A few weeks ago, the industry association had assumed a decline in earnings by 12 %, which means that the situation has been more tight since spring.Bisignani stated that the shrinking of the world trade by an estimated 15 % probably means the worst contraction since the 1930s.No signs of a significant recovery have yet been recognized.
On the one hand, the aviation companies would have to stand up on a struggle for survival, and on the other hand, they should not compromise in flight safety (safety), in the security in passenger transport (security) and in environmentally friendly use of kerosene.The spirited Italian, who had led Alitalia once in the 1990s and cheered on the listeners with "Basta" appeals, put the providers of monopolitan areas on the pillory, which absorbs around 11 % of the airlines' sales volume.This time the worst grades received the British Airport Authority (BAA) and the Indian airports Delhi and Mumbai;
For the coming years, an increase in airport and passenger fees by 86 % or 207 % and 278 % has been announced at the destinations mentioned.The Prime Minister Malaysias, Dato Sri Mohd Najib, showed a different way to the IATA delegated in his greeting address.Malaysia has temporarily reduced the airport fees in response to the recession by half.
Aviation had a multiplier effect of 12.5 on the Malaysias economy, with tourism, infrastructure and logistics in the foreground, was its reason.The nearby Singapore recently took similar measures to not least help the strongly hit Singapore Airlines.It is to be kept in mind that the airlines are still controlled by the government and that transport policy is managed by the government.
In any case, Asian carriers in the headwinding of the times when Asian airlines shone with black numbers came to an end in 2009.For once, a conservative strategy in hedging of the Kerosine price did not pay off, whereas US Airlines, which were committed to financial reasons, were still rewarded for their waiver, thanks to the oil price, which has fallen in the second half of the year.
According to an IATA statistics, which does not claim to be complete, the US airlines generated an operating profit of $ 1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2009, whereas the European and Asian competitors of $ 2 billion or 1 billion.What causes unrest in the industry is the leap of the oil price back to around $ 70 / barrel, because a revival seems to be signaled that has failed to materialize in traffic development.Not for the first time, Bisignani called on to shorten the capacities faster.
Within a year, the consolidated seat relief has deteriorated by 3 percentage points.In retrospect, it must be said that the airlines, encouraged by profits in 2006 and 2007, would have probably ordered too many planes.In the next three years, 4,000 aircraft - they are usually more efficient in kerosene consumption and quieter - will be delivered, which corresponds to 17 % of the fleet in use worldwide.
According to the IATA General Director, it will be difficult to stop the additional capacity on the market.Swiss CEO Christoph Franz found somewhat harder tones.The airlines have suffered losses of a total of $ 40 billion since 2001, and the industry, which was contaminated by numerous subsidies, has been sick.
The consolidation, as is preserved in the mergers Air France / KLM and Lufthansa / Swiss, must be promoted at an accelerated pace. «Reflexes» Page 24 Robuster Inland Market Chinasenz W. (NZ) NZ.
So far, the global recession has surprisingly lost the domestic traffic volume within the People's Republic of China.Air China, China Eastern and China Southern exceeded the previous year's value in April - measured by passenger kilometers sold - by 16 %, 25 % and 6 %.
The travel behavior was apparently more influenced by recovery after the earthquake of Sichuan and further loosening of the restrictions in traffic between China and Taiwan.In contrast to the robust inland market, the downward trend in international business and especially in the air freight continued.According to the Center of Asia Pacific Aviation, it cannot be expected to rapidly revitalize the cross-border cargo business with China.
China Southern promoted 58.2 million passengers (+2.3 %) in 2008 and generated sales of $ 8 billion.Air China and China

Search for the signal from the depth / / technician from France and the USA compete in the search for the black boxes of AF 447. von Walter Jäggidie Emeraud is a French nuclear submarine that is actually designed for offensive inserts.
Now she is looking for the wreck and above all the black boxes of the AF 447 Airbus crashed in the Atlantic. Navigating with sonar technology is the daily bread of the submarine crews, otherwise you are blindly blind, writes the marine.The sonar sensors and the specialists on board should be able to locate the signals of the black boxes.
The prerequisite, however, is carefully emphasized that the black boxes are at all intact and are not buried under rubble.Help from America Sahl The US navy has now provided sonar detectors for the search.The high-tech material was flown to Brazil.
The acoustic sensors are then to be slowly pulled through the water by two ships on long cables and the sea can be licked.The French research submarine nautile would then be used to recover the black boxes, which can dive up to 6000 meters deep.Before the black boxes or meaningful debris are found, only the cause of the crash can still be found.
The focus of interest is the so -called pitot tube or dust pressure meter.The small pipes absorb the wind, the measuring device behind it calculates the speed from the pressure.The speed is measured compared to the surrounding air, i.e. taking into account counter or tailwind.
For the flight characteristics, the maximum and minimum pace, only this speed is important and not the one that the aircraft has opposite the ground.In addition, there is a reserve or standby system that is independent of all other systems in commercial aircraft.This calculates the location solely on the basis of the continued route.
According to the error messages that AF 447 sent out, this so -called inertia navigation probably failed after a short time.The data of the pitotroof and the associated instruments also serve to display the flight altitude and for the climbing or sinking speed are therefore very important.The tiny air entry to the system is tricky.
Airplanes have crashed because insects clogged it or because craftsmen had not removed an adhesive tape.In the case of AF 447, massive hailstorm may have damaged the devices.Hail could also have damaged the weather radar in the aircraft nose. 41 corpses of French and Brazilian recovery teams have so far baked 41 corpses out of the water.
Identification began to secure fingerprints.Emergency landing in Zurich flight zurich.- After the fire of a fan in a toilet, an aircraft on the way from New York to Zurich in Halifax, Canada, was noticed.

Question of political will / / with modern approach procedures, aircraft noise and CO2 emissions around Zurich airport were massively reduced.Switzerland would have a fist deposit against the German blockade in the north.
Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger shows little interest in implementing the project.Alex Baures was a top -class round that met at the invitation of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) on May 4, 2006 in meeting room 2 - 118 of the Zurich Airport: from the two aircraft farmers Airbus and Boeing via the airline Swiss and the airport operatorUnique up to the airspace authority Skyguide and the European umbrella organization Eurocontrol all sat at the table.
The topic: new approach procedures and the reorganization of airspace.At first glance, the technically looking dossier is of the highest political explosiveness: Zurich could take a pioneering role in the introduction of "green" approaching processes that could bring movement into the processed noise debate and the German blockade around the airport that is so important for Switzerland.
The new approach procedures would bring a massive reduction in noise above all over German soil.The Federal Council would finally have a real trump card in the fight against the flight lock, which the big neighbor imposed for the morning and evening hours.Since Germany in spring 2003, the airspace over the largely uninhabited Black Forest in the edge hours was closed, Zurich Kloten has had to be flew from the south over hollow and densely populated urban area.
From a sober point of view, this is an absurdity: 210 841 Swiss people, who are significantly affected by aircraft noise, face 744 affected South Germans.But now, it seemed, Switzerland had a real powder in hand for the first time: a noise pollution above the Black Forest in return for the cancellation of the German blockade.Radical reorganization of the airspace's background to the meeting is a complete reorganization of European air traffic, which is to be completed by 2020.
Until then, the European Union wants to use the SES (Single European Sky) project, whose decisions are also binding for Switzerland, triple the capacity of the airwalks, halve and reduce the environmental exposure by ten percent.This is only possible with a radical redistribution of the air spaces, which is no longer based on national borders, but after optimal flow of traffic.Control of flight operations via a central computer system should enable efficiency increase.
The “green”, satellite -based hint at airports is the heart of the undertaking.Here the experts have identified the greatest savings potential: outdated maneuvers lead to useless kerosene consumption and noise.
The procedure, which is practiced in Zurich Kloten today, has hardly changed since World War II.The pilot is oriented towards terrestrial radio fires, the descent takes place after a rigid, linear scheme.The air conditioning center essentially ensures that the minimum distances between the aircraft are observed, and assigns excess machines to a waiting room.
Thanks to computers, it is possible today to calculate the sink rate of an aircraft so precisely that it reaches the runway in gliding in gliding.With a large-scale aircraft, up to 350 kilograms of kerosene can be saved, which corresponds to a Tonne CO2 emissions.Because the engines are shining until the final approach, the gliding flight brings a halving of the noise over the areas, which are more than fifteen kilometers from the end of the slopes.
If the pilot also navigates using a satellite system, it can avoid noise -sensitive areas and slide the noise marks as far as possible.The slide flight (Continuous Descent Approach, CDA) has been tested in London Heathrow, but also in North America and in Australia for years in various variants.In the US capital Washington, the CDA is combined with satellite-based navigation (RNAV):
One of the flugid lines meanders along the Potomac River across a thin -popped area.In Stockholm, Frankfurt and Munich, attempts also run with the "Green Approach". The "Green" Ausflugre regime also has disadvantages.
Especially in the initial phase, until the system has worked up, gliding flight causes higher safety distances.That costs capacity.So far, the new processes are used primarily in low -traffic times.
The complex maneuvers must also be certified, which, depending on the zeal of the authorities, takes several months to years.And they pose new challenges for the aircraft centers.The systems only come up optimally when the flights are now controlled via a central computer from start to finish.
The implementation of the “Greens” approach variants was developed by the project group Sesar * and is one of the priority short -term goals of Eurocontrol.According to Olaf Dlugi, Chairman of the Executive Committee of Sesar, the new approach regime is decided: «It's all about that.»
The introduction will be recommended by 2012 - if you do not voluntarily participate, you will have to follow up by 2020 at the latest.Switzerland is faced with the alternative: delay the change for a few years - or go to the offensive and in return, in return, go to concessions.
Exactly this question arose at the meeting mentioned at the beginning in May 2006. And it was agreed: Switzerland should take the unique opportunity.
"The mood," Dlugi recalls, who had brought the topic to the table, "was tidy.“The political will was now in demand.But it is obviously a lack of that.
Because almost nothing has happened since then."Afterwards we no longer got any inquiries from the Swiss side on the subject," Dlugi told the World Week, "and when I asked my Swiss colleagues on it, I received evasive answers.»For him, a mystery is the change in mood at the Bazl.
Let Science Minister of Transport The Passivity on the Swiss side may be related to the fact that two central figures - Daniel Gschwind, then vice director at the Bazl, and Daniel Leiser from Unique Airport - have changed their employers.The main problem lies with the highest boss of the aviation authority: Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger (SP).
The Minister of Transport ultimately determines the pace.But Leuenberger, not a friend of flying anyway, shows a hardly hidden lethargy when it comes to Zurich Kloten.In April 2001, Leuenberger was pilgrimed to Berlin to personally negotiate a state contract for the management of Zurich Airport.
This naive tactical approach - chief officials are usually advanced for such negotiations - brought him harsh criticism from all sides.The parliament rejected the draft contract, whereupon Germany imposed the blockade.This personal disgrace
, so can be heard from Leuenberger's environment, he never wounded.Since then, constructive suggestions for solving the unsustainable situation from Leuenberger's department has been in vain.A year ago, the Bazl rejected the so-called cranked northern approach, which would have brought relief for the unequal densely populated southern and eastern lines- this was the emergency after the project had stayed in Leuenberger's office for over three years.
But action would be needed bitter.The temporary decline in air traffic as a result of the crisis is urging itself to try out new procedures.Regarding the “Green Approach”, the Bazl only experienced general places: “The Bazl has a strong interest in this procedure”, the spokesman Daniel Göring can find out that there are several ideas at different airports.»
One may not comment on the negotiations with Germany.Skyguide and the canton of Zurich are similarly reserved.A solution would be urgent for Unique, but the airport operator does not want to publicly interfere in the dispute with Germany. ** The massive and concrete fuel savings - depending on the calculation, could be avoided every year - in the sense of Leuenberger.
However, the Minister of Transport primarily relies on the purchase of myclimate flight tickets: For every air mile that flies one of his civil servants, the federal government pays an amount to a private organization that finances environmental projects and is located in the patron saint of Leuenberger.This does not save a gram of CO2;And the noise plagued residents use the indulgence payments for bad conscience.
As the Bazl continues, aircraft noise around Zurich airport is to be measured again.This measure was decided in April 2008 when the German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a state guest in Switzerland.Conclusion: While Europe sets the course for the future, Switzerland has been recovering long -known data.

Zumikon hopes for a new aircraft noise recipe / / thanks to the approach via GPS, the aircraft noise plagued Zumiker should be able to sleep in again from 2012.Ex-ambassador Thomas Borer is also strong for the new process.
By Michel Wenzlerzumikon.- A satellite -supported approach procedure gives hope noise in the region.It has already been tried and one of the core of the Single European Sky (SES) project, with which the European Union wants to reorganize the airspace by 2020.
On Tuesday evening, Aviatik experts and politicians made almost 500 listeners in Zumikon the approach variant tasty.Lars Lindberg from the Swedish company AvTech, which specializes in approaching processes, showed an animation at an event against aircraft noise.The procedure has advantages in horizontal and vertical navigation, said Lindberg.
The satellite -supported approach allows larger settlement areas to turn around.And the computer calculates the sink rate so precisely that the aircraft can reach the runway in gliding flight.The engines are thus throttled until the final approach - about five kilometers before the airport.
This not only creates less noise, less kerosene would also be burned and the CO2 emissions reduced.This approach variant was introduced at Stockholm Airport within six months, said Lindberg.Lindberg's colleague Olaf Dlugi was convinced that politicians want to solve new negotiations in Switzerland.
Until recently, the Küsnachter was head of the Sesar project group, who developed the new arrival regime.The implementation is binding by 2020 at the latest - not only for the EU, but also for Switzerland, said Dlugi, who, among other things, was jumbopilot at Swissair.Switzerland could even go ahead and introduce the satellite -based approach from 2012.
The advantage: the cranked north approach would be possible.Some see a trump card in the negotiations with the Germans in the new approach procedure, which would halve the noise pollution.For this reason, the aircraft noise foundation had invited two other speakers who advocate a hard approach to Germany:
National Councilor Hans Kaufmann, who wants to make the acquisition of German fighter planes dependent on the abolition of the German approach lock, as well as Thomas Borer, who had dealt with the dossier as a former Swiss ambassador in Berlin.Both found negotiating.However, the problem is less the Germans, but the Federal Council. "The technical possibilities are one thing, the everyday political life is the other," said Kaufmann, for example.
The SVP man did not hold back with criticism of Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger."As long as he looks after the dossier, nothing will work," he said.The transport minister prefers to have no traffic at all - neither on the street nor in the air.
Apparently, Kaufmann could not explain it any other way, which is why Dlugi, with his request to introduce the satellite -based approach until 2012, did not come across open ears at the Federal Office for Civil Aviation.There was also no mandate for Thomas Borerhäge for Leuenberger from ex-ambassador Borer, who is now a business advisor.The Federal Council does not know the facts, he said.
And you have to negotiate with the Germans differently - harder.Borer is in favor of winning German companies that benefit from a flourishing Zurich airport, for Switzerland and thus putting pressure on the Berlin government.This can be increased with further measures:
Printing agents are also transit traffic and atomic repository in Benken.The audience was visibly impressed by the statements of the speakers.But these may have aroused some hopes that they cannot fulfill so quickly.

Is Moritz Suter surpassed by Martin Ebner?/ / Robert Wildineben
Swiss also fight the other Swiss airlines with the effects of the aviation crisis.This with very different success.While the airline Swiss is mainly defending itself with the reduction of sitting capacities and operating costs against the current aviation crisis, the smaller Swiss airlines are also required in the course of global market turbulence.
The four largest among them, Hello Airlines, Helvetic Airways, Baboo and Darwin Airline, pull out of the affair with very different success.The Basel Hello of founders and owner Moritz Suter, which, due to the German ownership relationships at Swiss (Lufthansa), is rightly known as the “largest Swiss airline” due to the German ownership.However, this title could be in danger, because in Hello in September 2008 Iceland Express the most important airline customer for the so-called wet lease business.
At the Wet Lease, also called ACMI, entire flight grotations are operated with their own crews in the order relationship.New capital.The sudden loss of Iceland Express forced the Hello airline to park two out of six MD-90 machines at Zurich Airport during the week.
Falling income and high fuel costs pressed the liquidity.At the beginning of the year, Michael Pieper, head of the kitchen construction company Franke and Suter colleague from old Crossair times, now shot new share capital at Hello.Further capital deposits are not necessary for the time being, says Irish Hello Managing Director Robert Somers, who recently had to reduce costs.
The fleet was reduced to five machines, in winter 2009/10 two more are to be pulled out of circulation.According to Somers, better conditions have been negotiated with the aircraft leasing company.Dumping prices.
The original Hello business model had to be revised.The ACMI share of flight movements has once shrunk from 70 percent to currently five percent.Hello now flies charter chains on behalf of holiday organizers.
"Wet Lease is currently not a profitable business because a lot of aircraft are available in the market at dumping prices," says Somers, who is in front of a new fleet of four Airbus or Boeing machines in summer 2010.For the time being, however, his motto for the current crisis year is: "survival".The turnover of Suters Hello will fall significantly below the border of CHF 100 million in the previous year.
The prospects at the Helvetic Airways by Financier Martin Ebner are more positive.Started as a deficit cheap airline with a fixed price model, she shifted her business model from line and charter to ACMI and today moves three out of four FOKKER100 machines with medium to long-term contracts on behalf of Swiss.Thanks to the strong partner, Helvetic in 2008 flown in a profit of CHF five million.
Growth strives for boss Bruno Jans with the fourth machine, who completes line and charter flights to Italy, Spain and the Balkans in the summer season.New structure .Martin Ebner has restructured the organization of his airline and founded Helvetic Airways Group AG as a hunt -tired daughter of his investment company Patinex at the end of May.
According to the “Travel Inside” specialist newspaper, the new holding company holds all shares of the Helvetic Airways and the Horizon flight school.The starting signal for an expansion phase?In any case, fleet reduction is not up for discussion at the moment, says Bruno Jans.
"If we see potential for growth, we can also take this step." The Geneva Airline Baboo has already had a striking expansion boost.In 2008, she increased sales by a whopping CHF 56 million and served 14 European destinations with three EMBRAER Aircraft and two of the Bombardier-Dash type.Baboo has benefited from the fact that various airlines in Geneva withdraw from destinations and immediately occupied them.
Only in autumn new flights to Bordeaux, Toulouse, Athens, Bucharest and Zagreb were launched.According to Baboo spokeswoman Nilufer Gumus, consolidation is announced for 2009.Italian market.
The intensification of partnerships with other airlines is also on the Baboo agenda.There is a collaboration on the Geneva Lugano route with the
Tessin Darwin Airlines.Despite the crisis, this is also aiming for growth and now processes the Italian market more.A Milan's own shuttle bus was set up to Lugano in order to be able to transport passengers from there to Geneva.
Seasonal flights to Sicily and entire flat rates (flight and hotel) also want to introduce Darwin.In July, Darwin will therefore put a fifth into operation for the four machines of Saab.Nevertheless, high spirits are not the order of the day, because in the first quarter there was a decrease in sales of ten percent.
Current life insurance is therefore also for Darwin the WET lease business, which currently includes two thirds of the flight movements.570 new jobs were created at the EuroAirport Basel last year.According to the latest employment figures, 435 of them fell on the aircraft maintenance and conversion area.
There were a total of 6475 jobs at the EuroAirport at the end of December.Most employees, namely 61 percent, are French, followed by Swiss, Germans and British.AP

Lufthansa buys majority to British Midland / / CEI.Frankfurt, 22nd
Junidie Deutsche Lufthansa becomes a majority owner of the airline British Midland (BMI).She has agreed with BMI founder Michael Bishop.Accordingly, Bishop does not use its sales option for 50 % plus a share.
The German airline compensates him with £ 175 million.For the actual stock package, a participation company pays £ 48 million.Lufthansa initially holds 35 % on this, a trustee the rest.
Once the traffic rights are secured, it will be 100 %.It is therefore a similar construction as it was used when the Swiss was used.Overall, Lufthansa costs the takeover of the BMI package £ 223 million (CHF 400 million).
This looks like a high price for a society that is said to have suffered a loss of £ 110 million in 2008.Lufthansa also writes that BMI has increasingly got into economic difficulties in recent years, which had massively exacerbated the recession.In addition, Lufthansa can only now carry out a thorough examination of the books (Due Diligence).
A spokeswoman said what the Lufthansa will do with the majority share.After taking over the package, Lufthansa will have 80 % of the BMI shares.20 % are still with the SAS, which is willing to sell.
It is still unclear whether Lufthansa will also take over these shares.Bishop had previously given the value of his sales options to Lufthansa at £ 300 million.From this point of view, Lufthansa has now been able to obtain a estate.
Until the crisis, BMI was considered attractive because the company has 11 % of the start and landing rights in Heathrow.Green light for Brussels-takeover Höltschi R. (HT) Brussels, June 22nd.Ht.
The EU Commission approved the planned takeover of the SN Airholding, the parent company of the Belgian airline Brussels Airlines, on Monday.The Commission had come to the conclusion that the transaction on the routes from Brussels to Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg and Zurich gave rise to competition law concerns.In order to clear up this, Lufthansa has agreed to make it available for these four routes of other airlines (time niches for start and landing).
This enables market entrants to offer flights on these routes.Lufthansa will initially take over 45 % of Brussels Airlines.It wants to complete the transaction at the end of the month and has an option for acquiring the remaining 55 % from 2011.

Business jets remain more and more on the ground / / Aviation suffers from the economic crisis.It is particularly hard in Kloten companies that earn their money with business jets.
The crisis is not only to blame for the misery.By Matthias Müller airport.- In times when large companies worldwide call for state aid, business jets have become a symbol for luxury and a burden on image.
This is reflected in the current traffic statistics of Kloten Airport.In the months of January to May, Unique will have 21.5 percent less flight movements from January to May.The victims are the local airline operations at Kloten Airport, who earn their money with business and VIP flying.
In the area of business charter in particular, the bookings are very declining, as Jürg Fleischmann, managing director of Lions Air AG at the Kloten Airport, confirms: «In this area we have a good 15 percent less.That is about 5 percent of our sales.»Fleischmann not only creates the crisis:
«We are fighting two fronts.On the one hand with the lack of certain customers, on the other hand with the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, which is leading to the introduction of new regulations in Europe. »But since business with business customers within the Lions-Air Group is only a small part (the group includesIn addition to the field of flight operations, also film productions and traffic monitoring) can be cushioned relatively well.The 170 employees have therefore been spared short -time work or discharge.
Fleischmann expects even bigger burglaries: «The valley sole has not yet been reached.We will therefore continue to expand our special missions such as outpatient clinic and film flights. »Aircraft management as compensatory tones is heard from Jet Aviation Business Jets AG, the largest provider at Kloten Airport.
"In the months of January to May, business characters declined," says Managing Director Martin Bernegger.While the numbers at the business jets remained stable during the week, the demand for the so-called leisure destinations (Samedan, Venice, Nice) decreased in particular on weekends.However, the Jet Aviation has the advantage of wider diversification.
«We start the declines in Aircraft management again.»The latter means the operation of business jets on behalf of private owners."We have gained customers here in the months," said Bernegger.
Many companies that had previously managed their jets with their own department were forced by the economic situation to put their planes into the care of such an Aircraft manager.Thanks to this horizontal postponement of the business, the 60 employees can continue to be employed on the ground and 80 in the air.Execujet AG, which employs around 130 people at Kloten Airport, also had to "record a decline in activities" during the months of January to April.
In May and June, however, good results were achieved."We had to restructure our business to adapt to the current economic situation," continued Migeon.In the case of smaller aircraft, however, a tendency to switch to 1st class of the large airlines can be seen.
The larger aircraft on the intercontinental routes, on the other hand, are still very busy.Heinrich Marti, co -owner of Global Business Jet Services in Kloten, also recognizes the declining development.The small company works in the brokerage, sales and marketing area.
"We record 40 to 60 percent fewer business customers," says Marti.Companies in particular book less.He believes that there are too many providers and that the current crisis leads to the adjustment of the market.
At the same time, however, he already feels a consolidation of the situation.As a noise factor, not relevant in the aircraft noise opponents, the declining flight movement numbers in the small aircraft segment hardly trigger any echoes."As a source of noise, the business jets are not relevant for us," says Ralph Weidenmann, Copulae of the Citizens' Protest Aircraft noise East.
However, he basically finds these transports nonsensical.«The problem is not the noise.But it simply makes no sense if 30,000 passengers are promoted with 25,000 flight movements. »Image

Airlines with mortgages in their ecological balance / / airlines run more than other modes of transport to be asked to pay for the exposure to the environment with pollutants.The industry is aimed at limiting CO 2 emission in absolute quantities from 2020 even if the growth continued.
In front of the UN climate summit, which will take place in Copenhagen next December, a racing of industry organizations and companies can be observed, all of which are as "green" as possible.At the 65th annual conference of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Kuala Lumpur, the topic was not on the wall for the first time, but more specific suggestions were already discussed.There are many ways to reduce the CO 2 emissions, but according to Iata General Director Giovanni Bisignani, it is central that the aviation authority (ICAO) presents a coherent model in order to effectively combat the pollutant emissions.
The ICAO conference, which will be held at the beginning of July, are expected to do this.The result of the Aviation industry organized in the IATA, which speaks for over 90 percent of the traffic performance in international passenger and freight traffic, has set three specific goals in Kuala Lumpur: thanks to the use of more efficient aircraft, especially thanks to technological advances in engine construction,Savings of 1.5 percent annually will be sought in the coming decade.
From 2020, it should then be ensured that the aviation no longer affects the environment, so the CO 2 emissions are no longer allowed to exceed a certain upper limit.By 2050, the emissions of carbon dioxide will be reduced by 50 percent, which from today's perspective seems to be very ambitious.For the current year, the IATA is already forecasting a decline in CO 2 output by 7 percent, of which 5 percentage points on fewer traffic movements and the remaining 2 points to real savings should be eliminated.
In this context, the eco-strategy, which rests on four pillars, was based on more efficient engines, the use of biotional fuels, the optimal use of the airspace (direct routes as possible and no flights in queue) and also on the trade in emission certificates.On each of these four fields, mosaic stones are placed in small work on entrepreneurial initiative so that the "green fly" is possible.-Up to the way, Virgin Atlantic, Air New Zealand, Continental Airlines and Japan Airlines have made various successful flight experiments with the use of biotropolitansDrives.
It is central that such energy sources did not lead to the displacement of food and feed cultivation.Therefore, for example, palm oil has a poor ecological balance, whereas inedible Jatropha nuts, Camelina (candy doters) and especially seaweed do well.Although the potential of these energy sources has been assessed as great over the decades, airline managers in Kuala Lumpur were struck up to be reluctant tones.
Willie Walsh von British Airways openly questioned that biotraps can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and distributed worldwide.It was said elsewhere that algae is spoken much as energy sources, but would offer a lot more opportunities in the area of biotropics but would offer palm oil.There was an agreement that it will take years to replace only 1 percent of total kerosene consumption with environmentally friendly biotial fuels.
The IATA specification of getting to a tenth until 2017 should hardly be met.Waiting for the initial spark of the ICAOUNVEDEDENDENTEN that the aviation must expect various additional tax loads.Bisignani therefore demanded that environmental taxes do not simply disappear in the lodging hole of the state treasury, but are used effectively to improve the carbon dioxide balance.
Obviously, this is not given in advance.In any case, the greatest hopes are used to fulfill the Kyoto requirements on the establishment of a global trade in emission certificates.The demand for flight services would then pay in line with the fact that he leaves his "climatic footprint" in the environment.
However, in order to come to a system that neither traffic operators nor countries discriminated against at the expense of others, it is still a long way.Uniform requirements are expected from the ICAO, but which can hardly be accomplished with regard to divergent interests of industrialized and developing countries.In any case, there was unity in Kuala Lumpur that a supranational approach is needed to meet the global dimension of pollutant emissions and the environmental pollution given.

The announcement is another setback for the American aircraft manufacturer, who had only announced a renewed delay in the “Dreamliner” first flight due to the necessary structural reinforcements.The delivery delays are regrettable that the decision to be killed was not directly influenced, the Australian flag carrier emphasized.Boeing has been negotiated with Boeing about modification of the orders since April.
Thanks to the agreement, the carrier, which has to struggle with a slump in demand in the premium segment and strongly increasing competition from the Gulf States, saves $ 3 billion.The Australians had ordered a total of 60 “Dreamliners” from Boeing in 2005 to gradually replace the outdated Boeing 747 - 400 and Boeing 767 - 300.CEO
Alan Joyce emphasized on Friday that the economic environment had deteriorated dramatically.The first 15 type 787 aircraft are now expected from mid -2013, three years later than originally planned.With these machines, the low -cost aircraft of Qantas, Jetstar, wants to expand its presence in international traffic to Asia and Europe.
Another 15 aircraft are to be delivered from the end of 2014 and replace the Boeing 767 of Qantas on the inner Australian routes.The last delivery of 20 jets for Qantas and Jetstar is planned between 2015 and 2017.At the option of being able to buy 50 other “Dreamliners” at a later point in time, it is recorded.
Regardless of the announcement, Qantas remains the carrier with the most fixed orders for the new long -distance jet from Boeing.It had been announced earlier that in the second half of the 2008/2009 financial year, a loss would be expected.In the past few months, Qantas has reduced the staffing stock by 1600 positions, including in management.

Aircraft noise and nuclear end storage / / Annette Mahromit were discussed in the Eurodistricts Council hot iron.The Council of the Trinational Eurodistricts Basel (TEB) wants to enforce a trinational distribution of noise and air pollution at the EuroAirport accepted by all airport trailers.
A proposal catalog developed within the committee was unanimously adopted yesterday's meeting in Saint-Louis.The new Basel bidder District President Hanspeter Frey (FDP), who was particularly confirmed as possible, felt confirmed as far as possible to use direct approach procedures.The desire of the Districts Council Commission that relief on the one hand should not be at the expense of the neighbors, the Allschwiler called Fromm but unrealistic: «I think that is hardly feasible.
»The further demands for use exclusively noise maker aircraft, a night's sleep from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and air plane brimming outside of the border hours and weekends signed everyone.The council president and deputy maire of Saint-Louis, Jean-Marie Zoellé, spoke out with the Binninger Mayor Charles Simon for a clear trinational push.
Nevertheless, Zoellé also warned rights of the thinner populated areas.While the topic of harbor noise has only been briefly stripped and the discussion about borders in the national planning of shopping centers to the next district council meeting, the ghosts unexpectedly divided the formulation of an application that a deep bearing for radioactive waste has to be prevented near the TEB.Finally, 18 out of 32 councilors present voted for it.
The German member of the state parliament Ulrich Lusche (CDU) wanted to mitigate the application because he rejected the Sankt Florians principle.Lusche preferred to formulate more reserved.There was mainly from Swiss council members who demanded a significant rejection.

14-year-old survived misfortune / / Rudolf Balmer, Parisein Airbus A310 of the Yemenia Airways yesterday fell off the coast of the Comores on the approach to the Indian Ocean.
Of the 153 inmates, at least one young person survived the accident.The flight to Moroni on the Comores started on Monday in Paris at Roissy airfield with an Airbus A330 of the state Yemeni airline Yemenia.In Marseille, another 78 people rose.
During an intermediate landing on the Sanaa airfield (Yemen), the passengers had to change to another aircraft for the continuation of the trip to the Comorical capital Moroni, an Airbus A310 from 1990.After a first unsuccessful landing maneuver, this machine supposedly started a second approach to Moroni when she crashed into the sea a few kilometers off the coast for unexplained reasons.A comoric government spokesman mentioned bad weather conditions.
Of the 142 passengers and eleven crew members, a 14-year-old survived, according to comoric reports, who clung to a wreck part.It is exhausted, but largely unharmed.Fischer and rescue teams that are supported by France from the neighboring islands of Mayotte and La Réunion have recovered four corpses and searched for further survivors yesterday.
Flying coffins.Just one month after the Air France's accident when flying from Rio to Paris, the shock in France is particularly large after this new catastrophe.66 of the passengers are French citizens, the majority of the other people live in France.
In the Marseille region alone, a comoric community of around 80,000 people lives who have practically no alternative to the flights of the Yemenia for their home visits, whose ideas of security had repeatedly complained.That is why bright anger is now mixed into the grief of the bereaved.A spokesman for the "SOS Voyages Comores" association, which had organized a protest rally in Marseille a year ago against the flight conditions of the Yemeni airline, was except: "
For us Komorer, the Yemenia uses wrecks and flying coffins from Sanaa.What happened now had to happen sooner or later.
»According to the French State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bus Sereu, the accident machine had been banned from Europe since an inspection in 2007.Sda

It is the safest way to stay at home / / How dangerous is flying?More dangerous than train driving.
But when comparing the car, it depends on how to count.Those who travel a lot live most dangerous.A plane flies from A to B from Walter Jäggiwenn, crosses several phases that are very different.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing analyzed the accidents of all line jets worldwide from 1998 to 2007.The result (see graphic): The final phase of the approach and landing is dangerous.
Also with relatively short rollers on the ground occur, astonishingly, many fatal accidents occur, for example in the case of clashes, or when an aircraft beyond the slopes.The most harmless is the travel freight, which claims almost 60 percent of the time, but only nine percent of accidents can be assigned.Another perspective of dangerousness is shown in the accident statistics of the US offices for traffic accident examinations (NTSB):
In relation to 100,000 flight hours, there were 0.1 accidents on scheduled flights in the United States last year, but 1.3 for charter companies, 1.5 with taxi aircraft and 7.1 among the private aircraft very popular in America.Everywhere, the Dangeran American Office for Air Transport (FAA) has lurked a list of the most common causes of accidents on which the investigation reports can be seen.Here are some of these risk factors: bird strike is not very common, but often has catastrophic consequences because the plane is in a delicate flight phase.
For example, transport goods can caught fire or create smoke.Fuel tanks can explode.Pilots can make wrong decisions, or misunderstandings occur in mutual agreements in the cockpit.
Weather, especially ice cream, can affect the aircraft of the machine.Navigation devices or control systems can fail, for example due to maintenance defects, or malfunctions can occur, for example triggering the thrust reversal in the middle of a flight.Errors of the aircraft designers can lead to difficult -to -recognize error displays in the cockpit.
Air traffic controllers, mechanics or charging workers can make mistakes that make an aircraft difficult.As with all accidents, the following also applies in air traffic: a chain of factors always leads to the accident.
And ultimately the cause is always due to human misconduct.Even if "force majeure" is asserted like a thunderstorm or "technical failure" as a break in materials - someone could have recognized the risk.Which statistics believe?
But how dangerous is flying compared to other transport systems?That depends on the statistics.If you measure the number of injured deaths in the number of kilometers traveled and passengers conclude road traffic much worse than air traffic (see right -wing graphic).
In Switzerland, 5.5 people die on the street per billion passenger kilometers and only 0.26 in the air.However, one focuses on the probability that a certain vehicle in which you will climb, have an accident, do not conclude cars much worse than airplanes, contrary to the assertions of many Aviatik experts.According to Boeing statistics, one of 210 machines worldwide in recent years.
The numbers are very similar in Swiss road traffic: a serious accident came on 236 motor vehicles in 2007.The safest comparative number games are difficult because the number of accidents are placed in other relations depending on the transport system.The values in our graphic, which refer to the passenger kilometers covered, are therefore gross gifts.
It is only clear that - no matter how you calculate - the train is the safest means of transport from everyone.The fact that the risks of air and country traffic cannot be compared directly has a completely different cause: there is rarely a real choice between aircraft, train, bus and car.
You don't get on the plane because it is safer, but because you get to your destination faster or - with overseas tours - because there is no alternative at all.The enormous mileage that some contemporaries reach on professional, family and holiday trips throughout the year would not be possible without the plane.However, if you cover a lot of kilometers, you tend to live more dangerous, even if the means of transport on the individual kilometers are considered relatively safe.

14-year-old survives plane crash with the Komoren / / An Airbus from the Yemeni airline Yemenia Airways crashed on board with 153 people on Tuesday.A 14-year-old girl could be recovered unharmed. Rbp.
Paris, June 30th Airbus A310 of the Yemenia Airways crashed into the Indian Ocean on Tuesday on Tuesday when approaching the country off the coast of the Comores.Of the 153 people on board, according to the first reports, at least one person, a 14-year-old girl who survived the catastrophe.
The flight to the Archipelago of the Komoren east of Africa started on Monday in Paris at Roissy airfield with an Airbus A330 of the state Yemeni airline Yemenia.In Marseille there were another 78 people.Unsuccessful landing tests A stop at the airfield of Sanaa in Yemen had to change passengers for the continuation of the trip to Moroni, the capital of the Comores, to another aircraft, a 19-year-old Airbus A310 with 52,000 flight hours.
After another stopover in Djibouti, the pilot first attempted an unsuccessful landing in Moroni and then started a second approach when the machine fell into the sea a few kilometers off the coast for unexplained reasons.A comoric government spokesman mentioned bad weather conditions.Of the 142 passengers and 11 crew members, according to comoric reports, a 14-year-old girl survived the accident practically unharmed.
It was brought into hospital care.Fischer and rescue teams who received support from the neighboring French overseasritories Mayotte and La Réunion were looking for further survivors at the scene of the accident.Just a month after the Air France's accident when Rio de Janeiro flight to Paris, the shock in France is particularly deep after this new civil aviation disaster.
66 of the passengers are French citizens, the majority of the former citizens of the former French colony Komoren, which have been living in France, have been living in France.In the Marseille region alone, a comoric community of around 80,000 people lives who have practically no alternative to the flights of the Yemenia for their visits to their homeland.Many exile comor had repeatedly complained about their standards of security and service.
That is why the grief of the relatives and acquaintances of the alleged victims of the catastrophe is now also mixed.A spokesman for the “Sos Voyages Comores” association, which had organized a protest rally in Marseille a year ago against the flight conditions of the state Yemeni airline, was except: “For us
Komorer uses the Yemenia from Sanaa wrecks and flying coffins.What happened now had to happen sooner or later. »The
Consul of the Comores in Marseille shares the outrage of his compatriots.These problems on the connection between Sanaa and Moroni are unfortunately characteristic of the threatening situation on certain flight routes to developing countries.On Tuesday afternoon, the Marseille-Marignane airport building had violentness between the police and young comores, who asked for the Yemenia to announce the passenger list that had not previously been officially published.
No premature key to the French State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bus Sereu, had the accident machine, which had heard Air France until 1999, in France.An inspection in 2007 had produced defects and irregularities.Yemenia Airways is not on the black list of particularly dangerous societies, he said.
The former line pilot Gérard Feldzer, director of the Le Bourget Aviation Museum, warned of premature conclusions.First, there is no connection or analogy between the Air France catastrophe from Whit Monday over the Atlantic and the accident off the coast of the Comores.Second, the state in the cabin of a elderly passenger aircraft, which is objectionable by the comorists, does not mean that the technical maintenance of the engines of the machine was also insufficient.

I was in Paris by Mark van Huisseling -pasted week.Recently, coming from Zurich or flying there, Terminal 1, no more Terminal 2 (probably due to Schengen).MVH, it looked like it was the only time the only time that did not only find the CDG airport bad (I found it in order, the architecture sexy even).
But that was then, at the time of Terminal 2;Today, I have to say, it is different and Charles de Gaulles Terminal 1 Une Poubelle (with little space, hardly any cafés, no duty-free shop, no right lounge, not even sockets).I mean, I am a lawyer of flying, and if I still believe in shares, I would have that from Swiss (or Lufthansa), but after Paris mvh will probably have to drive with the TGV in the future, Désolé.
In the city resp.to come to my hotel - I lived in the "Castille" on Rue Cambon, next to Chanel;I was a guest of Tag Heuer, a watch company - was also not free of effort.
The chauffeur said that traffic on the highway was fluid, but you had to wait everywhere, some streets were closed because Israel's head of government Netanyahu hit France President Sarkozy.Sure, world politics is somehow needed, you can see that.Nevertheless, it gets on your nerves when you have to ask police officers from the CRS to be able to get through a lock to get to L 'Eclaireur on Rue Boissy D' Anglas (I recommend this shop, there is good clothes and beautiful onesFurniture and a minor items for at home).
On Avenue M., near the Champs-Elysées, there is the “Plaza Athénée” in which I would live if I were successful.So I was interested in what it looks like Chez Lvmh, on this beautiful street.And it looks chic:
In the hall (bright marble, bronze-colored escalator, reminds a little of CDGS Terminal 2) there are two Murakami sculptures and some support bar with LED light tapes (you think of Jenny Holzer; is not art, but are just pictures of clothes, perfumeset cetera). In the third floor where there are offices, I met Lewis Hamilton, a racing driver.(That was a bit careless now - he was waiting in a room, so it was.
And he makes an advertisement for the new watch, Monaco LS Chronograph Calibre 12.) «Lewis, what is your work-life balance at the moment?" -" It's a hard time, I have double pressure.I train a lot and need time to improve the car.»
- «Do you have someone who lives for you, so to speak?Who makes deposits, get clothes from cleaning..." -" Yes, my father, he is responsible for my daily life.
Then I have a staff assistant and some McLaren managers." -" Do you go shopping?" - " No ." -" but you are already from this world, right?
Do you know how much, we say, an edition of the Sun costs?" -" I come from normal conditions.The Sun, 30 Pence?"(" 20 pence, "says the Personal Assistant.)
«How about Nicole, do you see yourself every now and then?"(Nicole Scherzinger, his girlfriend and singer at the Pussycat Dolls.)" It's good, but we don't see each other often.
If I have a few days off, I take the jet and fly to where it is."His favorite restaurant in Geneva, where he lives, is" Le Relais de lentrecôte ". The dinner then took place in one of my favorite restaurants, the" Avenue ".There the eye eats (this sentence is from Boris Becker, I like to enter), it is visible to Elite's offices, a model agency.
The girl at the reception did not recognize me, that bothered me a little (at least she didn't know Alain Prost-and he is French, was also a formula 1 world champion four times).Our table was on the first floor, which is good for tourists, I think.MVH, by the way, does not know a restaurant where the first floor is better than the ground floor.

Top American Airlines / / Despite the significantly deeper fuel costs, American Airlines flown in a pure loss of $ 390 million in the second quarter.The whole industry suffers from the recession and credit shortage.
CLS.New York, July 15th Corp., the parent company of American Airlines and American Eagle, has shown a pure loss of $ 390 million for the second quarter, compared to a shortfall of $ 1.46 billion in the same period last year.Without special pollution in connection with the sale and decommissioning of aircraft, the loss was $ 319 million or $ 1.14 per share.
The result is less bad than was feared;The Wall Street Augure had expected an adjusted loss per share of $ 1.28.In the previous year's result, extraordinary costs for depreciation were included on the fleet, without which the loss would have been $ 298 million.
For the first half of the year, the loss on 765 (i.V. 1802) mile is more high.American Airlines is the first larger airline to report on the second quarter.AMR recorded a decline in sales by 21 % to $ 4.89 billion.
The failure due to the swine flu is estimated at $ 50 million to $ 80 million.For the first six months, sales amount to $ 9.73 billion or 18.1 % less than in the previous year.AMR has dismantled capacities and is planning to reduce the offer by 7.5 % in Germany and 5.5 % in international traffic for the second half of the year.
The degree of utilization has decreased from 82.5 % to 81.8 % compared to the previous year;AMR still took 11.65 (13.76) cents per passenger mile.The Kerosine Prize has subsided by 40.5 % within a year;
The fuel bill was $ 44.9 % lower at $ 1.33 billion.In contrast, personnel expenses rose by 2.4 % to $ 1.70 billion, although the employment was reduced by 6500 to 79,200.Suspective summer business losses may have suffered most of the other larger airlines in the second quarter, with the exception of the low -cost providers Southwest Airlines, Jetblue, Airtran and Alaska Air Group, for which modest surpluses are expected on Wall Street.
Most present their figures next week.Air traffic is usually revived in the second quarter, and the section July - September is usually the most profitable for the industry.In the recession, however, this pattern is no longer correct.
Last year, the high oil price had made the airlines thwarted.The biggest compromises are currently being carried out by the more lucrative business trips.In May, the passenger income was 9.5 % fewer passengers by 26 % lower than in the previous year.

British Airways gets fresh capital / / Pra.London, 17th July British Airways, is currently suffering more than other airlines because the British traditionally earned a lot of money in lucrative business traffic over the Atlantic-and just have to accept particularly strong losses from the recession.
In the first quarter (at the end of June), the airline flown in a loss of £ 100 million, as the company announced in advance on Friday.At the same time, it was announced that British Airways wanted to get fresh cash as a precaution over £ 600 million in order to be better equipped for these adverse times.£ 300 million should be able to flow into the company from the emission of a convertible bond, which, however, still has to be approved by the General Assembly.
Institutional investors should receive a participation that corresponds to their share, provided that you want this.The coupon is said to be between 5.5 % and 6.25 %.The bond is to be changed in 2014, which will correspond to a capital increase by 15 % to 20 %.
In addition, a liquidity reserve of $ 540 million (around £ 330 million) is transferred from the pension fund to the airline.According to the information, this is bank guarantees that were granted in 2006 in favor of the British Airways pension fund in the event of the company's bankruptcy.This financial framework is now to be transferred to the company itself.

A weak quarter for the US airlines / / to American Airlines have again flown high operational losses in the second quarter.Only the cheap provider Southwest was able to swing back into the black after three negative quarters.
CLS.New York, July 21., the parent company of United Airlines, has shown a modest net profit of $ 28 million for the second quarter, which, however, is thanks to special factors-especially winning from hedging transactions.In the operational business there was a loss of $ 323 million or $ 2.23 per share.
However, Ual did not cut off quite as bad as feared;The Wall Street Augure had expected a loss per share of $ 2.61.In the same section of the previous year, the net loss had amounted to $ 2.74 billion.
American Airlines opened the reporting season last week with the presentation of a loss of $ 390 million.Southwest Brilling Continental Airlines reported a loss for the section April to June on Thursday from $ 21 million or $ 1.72 per share compared to a short amount of $ 5 million in the same period.Without special loads, especially depreciation on obsolete aircraft, the adjusted result was $ 1.36 per share, which met the expectations of Wall Street.
Of the larger companies, only Southwest Airlines has been able to make a profit in the second quarter, which, however, was $ 83 % below the previous year.In view of the extremely difficult market situation, CEO Gary Kelly described the result as a very remarkable performance.
Southwest had previously flown into losses in the three quarters, like all rivals.However, Southwest had always stayed in the black in the past 17 years.If the cheap provider used to be lucky with fuel protection shops, Southwest has recently speculated and strived to dissolve hedging contracts.
Another capacity reduction of the fuel costs, which were still responsible for the losses last year, have significantly reduced within a year.The main problem is now in the declining volume of traffic and especially in the decline of more lucrative business trips.United recorded a sales decline from 25 % to $ 4.02 billion in the reporting quarter.
At Continental, he collapsed 23 % to $ 3.13 billion, while Southwest has only a minus of 9 % to $ 2.62 billion.American had shown a sales of $ 4.89 billion by 21 % last week.The income per passenger mile offered by United and Continental fell by 17 % each in the previous year, and 6 % for Southwest.
While the degree of utilization at American decreased slightly, it could be improved at Southwest and Continental, which means that both have disproportionately shortened the offer for the decline in demand.From September, all airlines are planning a further capacity reduction, which is usually to be more in Germany than in international traffic.

Dangerous rapprochement of aircraft in May 2007 / / Met.In the late afternoon of May 10, 2007, two commercial aircraft came dangerously via Swiss territory.The office for flight accident examinations (BFU) classifies the incident in the examination report just published as "difficult".
Approach was approached at an altitude of around 10,400 meters east of Schaffhausen, near the Enclave Büsingen.An Airbus A340 - 300 of the Chilean Lan Airlines were involved on a scheduled flight from Madrid to Frankfurt and an Airbus A321 - 100 of Austrian Airlines on the way from Vienna to Paris.The two planes came horizontally around two kilometers and vertically around 300 meters.
The dangerous approach is due to this, the BFU writes that the air traffic management for the upper airspace in Zurich had allocated a sink approval to a height outside of its own area of responsibility in a phase of high, complex traffic without prior coordination.An unclear and misleading sector coordination also contributed to the situation.It continues that the affected airspace sector was looked after by a trainee during the approximation phase of the two aircraft before the traffic management took over due to the high traffic.

The risk of connecting flights is particularly high, as traffic commissioner Antonio Tajani announced in Brussels on Tuesday.33 million pieces of luggage worldwide were lost last year: "Sometimes it is errors, sometimes thefts, sometimes the barcode attached on the luggage doesn't work properly," said the traffic commissioner.
Tajani announced a review of the compensation rules.So far, travelers are entitled to a maximum of 1100 euros if their abandoned luggage disappears during the flight.Tajani also wants to check whether the previously from airline to airline could be adjusted to different weight upper limits for hand luggage.
He also confirmed the intention of lifting the restrictions on taking drinks, shampoo, perfume and other liquids in hand luggage.However, this will only be possible if control devices are available that could distinguish between liquid explosives and harmless substances.(AP)

Once again - lost control of the pilots via their aircraft / / modern commercial aircraft are relatively easy to fly in everyday life.However, if disturbances occur, they can turn into extremely complex systems in a matter of seconds.
The Air France accident above the South Atlantic has once again remembered this.Just a few weeks after the Flying Air France 447, the French flight accident investigation authority Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Alses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile (BEA) published a 70-page report on the accident.Unsurprisingly, this delivers only a few information about the course.
The paper contains so little substantial that you have to ask yourself why the Bea wanted to publish a first interim report so quickly.The procedure can only be explained by public pressure - after all, 223 people had died in the accident.Ships are still looking for the vote and flight data recorder, the two most important data sources that could provide more information about the crash of the Airbus A330- 200 with the registration F-GZCP.
As is known, the chances of finding the two devices are not particularly good in view of the depth of the sea in the accident region.Black peter game. What actually happens if the devices are really not found and there will be no further findings on the accident?
Can the air traffic industry really not draw any conclusions from misfortune, can it not learn anything?If she takes her own claims seriously, then she even has to do it.Because many evidence from the time before the accident and the way the participants tried to treat the misfortune afterwards show that the case must not be laid on the files.
Rather, AF 447 already makes it clear that industry has to develop a new security awareness.Since the Airbus fell into the sea on June 1, industry has been waiting for new findings and have been waiting for the participants to blame each other behind the scenes.They argue that it is not yet clear whether the dowel pressure pipes (Pitot Tubes), which according to automatic maintenance reports had delivered incorrect speed data, were the cause of the crash.
But the approach alone is unmasking: since it cannot be ruled out that the pitot probes have played a role in the chain of events that triggered the misfortune, the industry should already act as in any case asthe devices are identified as a trigger.Instead, however, there is largely behind and sometimes in front of the scenes there is an unsightly struggle between those involved.
Air France boss Pierre-Henri Gourgeon publicly speculated about the causes of the accident when the first parts of the wreckage were not even spotted, and of course excluded mistakes from his company.At the same time, high-ranking Airbus employees subtle that Air France has had to complain about three accidents in recent years.And Eric Tahon, Air France captain and union member, demands that the company should no longer only pay attention to the costs, but rather invest more in training.
- The fact that particular interests are made public in this extent would actually have to be seen as an alarm sign.Because the generally recognized code of conduct stipulates that in the event of accidents, the general interest in greater security occurs.And although flying is already a very safe way of traveling, there is no reason to let up:
According to the “Flight International” specialist magazine, the security level of the industry has not improved for the first time in the past ten years;It has stagnated - of course at a very high level.And especially accidents such as that of AF 447, in which the pilots have lost control of their aircraft for various reasons, give some occasion to worry, because they have accumulated in recent years, albeit not in every case comparable circumstances: Gulf Air (2000), Flash Airlines (2004), Armavia (2006), Adam Air (2007) and finally the crash of the Airbus A310 of the Yemenia in front of the comors have one thing in common - the aircraft are known according to everything that is known,Ducking, although the technical defects did not necessarily have had catastrophic consequences.
For various reasons, the pilots were no longer master of the situation.The industry therefore still does not seem to have found a solution to a fundamental problem: modern aircraft are easy to fly in everyday life, but when something goes wrong, they turn into extremely complex systems in seconds.
Counter tax can only be given with sufficient training.The official wake -up call is also required, but not only refers to the topic of training and industry itself.Authorities also have to be asked whether they have paid enough attention to known problems so far.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was known for a long time that the Pitot probes were responsible for a number of incidents in recent years, including two at Air Caraïbes and one at Northwest Airlines and Tam, all of which use the Airbus A330.As early as 2007, the failure of the probes was classified as dangerous in an EASA presentation.According to the authority, pilots can no longer fully and reliably fulfill their tasks in such a situation.
Despite its own assessment, the European flight safety authority has not yet been prompted to ban the probes of older types.It was only after the Air France disaster that she indicated such a step, but has not undertaken anything since then.Jens Flottauauf the search for victims and debris in the ocean on board a maritime reconnaissance reconnaissance Bréguet Atlantic the day after the Air France-Hunglück.reuters

Airspace free for drones / / "American airspace should be opened in general for unmanned aircraft. The set of rules required for this still has to be developed so that the safety in air traffic remains guaranteed.
The industry urges him.With some delay, the American aviation authority Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded orders for research and development in the area of unmanned aviation.It is about ensuring security in the airspace through the United States if, in addition to aircraft with pilots, drones without pilots are increasingly on the road there-state and private, police-military and commercial.
More traffic in the Himmelall community is assumed that the number of drones in the sky will increase.A variety of small, remote -controlled flight devices is already offered at affordable prices, flying with remote control is no longer reserved for model -loving hobbyists and inventors.The military use of large drones for spying and bombing destinations in crisis countries such as Afghanistan or Yemen is almost part of everyday war.
Commercial use of such devices, for example, for the delivery of express packages seems conceivable.The Amazon mail order company has recently announced a corresponding project in public, and other providers immediately followed up.In order for accidents when using drones in general airspace with increasing traffic, regulations are required for technical equipment and flying processes.
These regulations are now being developed under the supervision of the FAA, and they should be completed at the end of 2015 - an ambitious timetable.Economic interests of the American aviation industry is in a hurry, because Siewitterein good business.The Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems Industry Association predicts that the drone construction and traffic would generate $ 82 billion in sales and created 100,000 jobs within ten years from the opening of the airspace.
6 out of 25 applicants were now selected for the development of the basics for the new regulations.They should take over the development in the following fields: Safety standards for drones based on tests at several locations with various climatic types from the polar zone to the tropics to the dry deserts, from Alaska to Hawaii to Oregon and Nevada (University of Alaska, Nevada,Commercial Department of North Dakota, Texas A & M University- Corpus Christi) Airspace monitoring in the mixed traffic of aircraft and drones (state Nevada) Type testing and approval processes for drones (airport in the state of New York) Devices and procedures to avoid approaching or collision with other aircraft(Airport in the state of New York) Control technology and flight interest tests (trade department North Dakota, Texas A & M University - Corpus Christi) Emergency proceedings in system failure (Virginia Tech) The topic of data protection is also mentioned.
The aviation authority has proposed non -binding rules and a public consultation organized; the other should result from the dialogue of interested circles.Jim Williams, the responsible manager of the air authority, points out almost apologetically towards the great benefit of drones.They are not dangerous in civil use, but useful, he states.
In disaster cases, for example, they allowed the observation from the air without having to get danger.Standard to the world, the American airspace is essentially closed to drones;Such may only be used with a special permit.
In the future, however, according to the FAA's intention, the entire airspace should not only be open to manned, but also for unmanned aircraft, provided they meet the technical requirements and comply with the traffic rules.Because the American aviation authority sets the standard worldwide, it can be assumed that the new set of rules for drones will also receive international validity."

Film -ready emergency landing on the Highway / / New York.A one -engine propeller aircraft with three people on board was not excluded at a car road in the New York district of Bronx at the weekend.
According to the fire brigade, three passengers were injured, one of them seriously.The plane landed on the Major Deegan Expressway.The situation was "under control", cars were not damaged.
Neither had there been a fire nor had fuel left, it said.As a precaution, the firefighters pumped the fuel before the plane was removed.The injured were brought to a hospital.
The maneuver was necessary for a kind of engine problem, the spokesman said.There is still no further findings.At the time of the emergency landing, construction workers were nearby who helped stop traffic.
The incident led to several large traffic jams.According to media reports, the aircraft in Danbury in the US state of Connecticut started to take a sightseeing flight for the statue of freedom.Sda

Pressure drop in the cabin of an A380 / (dpa) ·
After a drop in pressure in the cabin, a machine of the world's largest passenger aircraft Airbus A380 with almost 500 people on board ended up in Azerbeidschan.Nobody was injured .The oxygen masks were triggered and the machine had certainly landed in the Caucasus Republic, the airline Singapore Airlines said on Monday.
The 467 passengers and 27 crew members were waiting in a hotel in the capital Baku for a replacement machine for the onward journey to the Southeast Asian city -state Singapore.The cause of the pressure loss is examined, it said.The plane started in London.

The airport is rejoiced, the Swiss moans / / current offensive of the airlines Emirates from Dubai and Etihad from Abu Dhabi let the Zurich airport cheer - they ensure nervousness at Swiss.The federal government also probes measures to strengthen the nationally significant hub carrier.
On January 1st, Zurich Airport announced a good news: “The new year is starting to his over 18,000 friends on Facebook:“ As of today, Emirates starts the A380 to Zurich.Happy New Year !»
At the celebrations on the occasion of the official reception of the Airbus A380 in Zurich, Stefan Conrad, head of operations at the airport, also spread: The fact that after the A380 of the Singapore Airlines a second “giant bird” in Zurich can be seen higher.beat and witness the high attractiveness of the location."We look forward to the success shared with Emirates." The mood in the headquarters of the Swiss is a happy pronunciation.The competitive pressure is known, especially the competition of the golf airlines.
The current offensive in Zurich and limited in Geneva are worried.Swiss manager Jean-Pierre Tappy says: «Thanks to the favorable framework conditions under which the Golf carriers operate, you can mix up the market with price offers where the European airlines cannot keep up.»There could be no question of a fair competition, since the golf carriers benefited from framework conditions that European companies could only dream of.
For example, the golf airlines at their hub airports would have no temporal restrictions and a price level around 65 percent.The different moods provide tensions among the system partners Airport and Swiss.The dispute over the amount of the fees, which is pending before the Federal Administrative Court, is particularly aggressive.
But also topics such as marketing campaigns of the airport to make other airlines of destinations or the increase in capacities tasty ensure red minds.A squad member of the airport sums up the situation as well: «It is like in a medium -sized marriage:
The first power struggles start after a few years, soon afterwards only a mediator will help.“It is not that far;Soon a “high-level discussion” will bring clarification.
Asked premium-offered conflict in Zurich shows as an example that the wind in European aviation is blowing rougher.Potent airlines such as the Turkish Airlines, the Emirates or the Etihad urge to pull out the existing long -distance traffic from Europe's hubs and to guide them over their own airports.
Two current examples in Zurich places a skill light on this development.On the one hand, Emirates has been running 7 of the 14 weekly return flights between Dubai and Zurich with an A380 instead of a Boeing 777.On the other hand, Etihad plans to spread in Europe - from Zurich and Geneva.
In November, the airline announced that it takes over 33 percent of the Ticino regional airline Darwin and regional converts in Etihad (NZZ 19, 13).The goal is clear: Passengers from Europe are to be flown to the home airport in Abu Dhabi for long -haul flights.The extent of the Etihad offensive is still unclear, Emirates has now presented.
The capacity of the Emirates increases by around 1100 seats or 23 percent per week by using the A380 between Dubai and Zurich per direction.According to the Emirates, the expansion is well received.Despite the higher capacity, there is no change in the percentage occupancy for the next few months.
Above all, the 8 luxurious private suites in the first class and the 42 modern flat bed seats in the business class are required.On the return flight to Dubai on Wednesday they were fully booked;A total of around 80 percent were sold.
It is clear that the Emirates relies on transfer passengers;Only around 40 percent of customers only travel from Zurich until Dubai.Measured on the number of passengers from Switzerland, the most important goals of the switching are, according to Emirates Thailand, India, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Australia.
If you take sales as a scale, the Maldives replace the Mauritius list.BUND checks measures that have become aware of the current development.
According to its spokesman, Urs Holderegger, the Airports Zurich and Geneva and the Swiss, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation recently placed the order to show the risks and opportunities for Swiss aviation with a view to the upheavals in worldwide aviation.These reports are intended to form the basis for the discussion about the future Swiss aviation policy.According to Holderegger, possible plans for the support of the Swiss industry are already in the drawer.
In this way, an expansion of the support for security tasks of the airports will be discussed.In addition, the promotion of training in aviation is checked.Basically, the fact that in Switzerland the dark sides of the aviation in Switzerland are increasingly being discussed, such as noise and pollutant emissions.
The economic development of the Swiss aviation is therefore closer limits than the competition from Golf or from Asia.Paul Kurrus, President of the umbrella organization Aerosuisse, also urges improved framework conditions for the industry.The offensive of Emirates and Etihad stands for nothing other than for a legitimate industrial policy of the Gulf States.
These have recognized that traffic brings prosperity.Europe, on the other hand, is luxury to steady the framework conditions.In relation to Switzerland and Zurich, Kurrus calls for a trend reversal.
Direct subsidies for the Swiss are not an issue for him.However, since Golf carriers had cost advantages of up to 30 percent, the conditions for the hub carrier in Zurich would have to be improved.The assumption of sovereign security costs and the investments in the training, which was already affected by the Federal Council, urgently would have to be implemented urgently.
In addition, politics must ensure that Zurich's airport could develop moderately;Today he is the hub with the strongest restrictions on Europe.The measures proposed by the Bazl are also in the sense of the airport, as operations chief Conrad says.
With regard to the golf carrier, however, he warns of pessimism: «In Zurich, the airlines from the Middle East have only 3 percent of the passenger volume.»The competitive pressure comes primarily from European airlines - and not from the dreaded golf region.

Board of the A380luxus pure promises Emirates in the A380.We looked around on board - in the video and picture route.· Superlatives are quickly at hand when talking about Emirates.
The airline from Dubai recently ordered no less than 50 additional A380 from Airbus at a record price of 23 billion euros.This will increase the airline's Superjumbo fleet to no less than 140 copies.Nobody else operates so many of the giant aircraft.
The Boeing 777 fleet is currently the largest worldwide with around 150 machines.Emirates thus confirmed her apparently unstoppable expansion strategy.By 2020, the airline boss, Tim Clark, even wants to rise to number 1 in the world with the company.
First, the position of Dubai as the leading turnstile in the Middle East should become unassailable.From this exclusively large -scale aircraft should operate all five continents in direct flight.No other carrier on the globe has organized itself in this way.
Success, of course, calls the envy on the scene.Because both Emirates themselves and the Dubai airport belong to the state and thus the prevailing monarch, critics accuse the company of preserving hidden subsidies that are equivalent to a distortion of competition.However, Emirates has to pay the same price for her fuel as any other airline.
A more precise consideration shows that apart from tax privileges, not secret subsidies, but low personnel costs, cheap financing models for the fleet and the advantageous geographical location of the hub in Dubai with a 24-hour operation.In contrast, airlines in Europe can only dream of such framework conditions.Not only Dubai, but also the other golf states strategically promote air traffic because they have recognized the importance of air traffic in the globalized economy.
The real luck is simply geography: 90 percent of the world's population can be brought to Dubai with a non -stark, and this is particularly useful as a stopover on the way from Europe to Far East / Australia and vice versa.Emirates can therefore collect the passengers in this country and then finish them smoothly in Dubai thanks to the efficient infrastructure of their own stroke in the Asian-Pacific space.There, for example, many cities are flown there in India that do not have any direct connection to Europe or the USA.
With the sheer size, the market power achieved and the strategically favorable location of the HomeBase in Dubai, it could therefore be possible to steer an ever more extensive part of passenger flows on long distances, while the European airlines are left behind.The ambitious future plans should not only make the big airlines from Europe and the USA tremble, but initially the two direct competitors from the same region, Etihad and Qatar.Because sooner or later overcapacity is likely to arise on the Persian Gulf.

Bern-Belp Airport: Thun region threatens more aircraft noise / / air traffic ·
Alpar wants to regular southern trips on Bern-Belp;The new regulations are to be launched next week.Resistance is formed in the Thun region.
Airplanes that are targeting the Belpmoos from the south should fly from Langenthal via Oberdiessbach, Steffisburg, Kiesen, Wichtrach and Münsingen.Usually, transport aircraft end up in Belp.There is already a few people at the south.
Hansruedi Blatti, Mayor of Wichtrach, says: «If the standard route carries out here, we will have to make a lot of preparation.“He therefore wants to bring the affected communities to a table.His counterparts in Thun and Steffisburg, Raphael Lanz and Jürg Marti have already been confronted with the topic.
You want to get involved in the discussion as soon as it is official.In addition, the aero clubs invite the municipal authorities to “exchange of views and an information meeting” on the airfield Thun for January 20.The region's aero clubs are also alerted: “When the intended ideas are implemented, our team is at the end.

In the future, aircraft will be heading for the Belpmoos via Aaretal / / The planned southern approach to Bern-Belp Airport is in the Aaretal, Emmental and Oberland.Municipalities are afraid of aircraft noise.
Clubs and associations of small flying feel pushed on the edge.They announce resistance.In about a year, Bern-Belp Airport is to be flown regularly from the south.
This is the plan of the airport operator Alpar.It wants to relieve the populated north, especially Bern and Muri, from aircraft noise.But the Alpar did the bill without the south.
In the Aaretal, Oberland and Emmental, there is resistance to the southern trips.Municipalities are afraid of aircraft noise (see article on the right).And above all the associations and clubs of General Aviation defend themselves.
Yes, the glider pilots and hangers go into the air with trouble.Southern approach as normally normally, transport aircraft land from the north at the airport.Occasionally, however, the Belpmoos is already flown from the south.
The machines turn in front of Muri and fly Belp in a small loop about the rubged by visual flight.That should change.In June of last year, the Alpar at the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) submitted the application for GPS-based approaches.
It wants to better distribute the approaches to the north and south.In the future, however, southern approach should become normal: the planes fly over the Emmental and Thun in a large loop (see graphic).
You then control the Belpmoos by instrument flight.For the Emmental and the Oberland, this means no "significant increase in stress," emphasized the Alpar.Associations do not belong remains open for the time being, what effects the new regime actually has.
Next week the Alpar will open the new operating regulations publicly.Today the Skyguide air traffic control publishes the changes in the airspace structure based on the GPS-based south flights.The Alpar does not comment and refers to the Bazl.
The public does not want to inform the public until Friday.Objections to the new regime are inevitable.Also because the airport has recently not made any new friends.
Not among the communities in the south, not with clubs and associations."We are disappointed that we have not been included in the procedure right from the start," says Christian Boppart, Managing Director of the Swiss Hangegreilerverband.«This is by no means common.»
And above all, it is concerned about the small flying.Enclosure The last medium -sized agent from the south has to expand the controlled airspace."This is particularly drastic for gliding and hanging director," says Christian Markoff, airspace representative at the Hängegreiferverband.
You must not stay unannounced in the controlled airspace."For the airport, only economic factors count," criticizes Markoff.In his view, however, compromises would have been quite possible - only this was made possible by the airport operator.
It only remains the means of objection.Switzerland's Aeroclub also finds clear words.He writes on his website:
"The loop around Bern airfield continues to move up - the lightaviatic and around the airport is more and more stalled." In the Bernese Oberland, worries of Belper Plans are also being followed in the Bernese Oberland - for example at the airfield."We would lose our main flight sector in the north," says airfield manager Philippe Seiler.«And when departing in the north, we would be massively restricted.

Swiss wants to protect the Golf Airlines Emirates and Etihad in Zurich and Geneva.It now demands backing from the federal government.
This signals openness to support.Andreas Schürerflimrichts from the Golf region such as Etihad or Emirates are increasingly pushing the European market to direct long -distance traffic via their own airports.Thanks to good framework conditions, you regularly make headlines via investments or aircraft orders.
The Emirates based in Dubai alone has 44 Airbusse A380 in its fleet, almost 100 more are ordered.According to Emirates, the order volume corresponds to almost 40 percent of all orders received by Airbus.Since the New Year, Emirates has been using an A380 between Dubai and Zurich every day.
After the Airline Etihad from Abu Dhabi already explained in November that she is striving for a strong presence in Europe from Zurich and Geneva, nervousness is growing in the Swiss aviation industry.While Germany limits the traffic rights for golf airlines, the sky over Switzerland is actually open.The Swiss manager Jean-Pierre Tappy calls for a rethink.
Unfortunately, the traffic rights would often no longer be used to connect countries, but that traffic is unilaterally deducted.Around 800 flights from the golf region to Europe took place a week, but only around 120 from European airlines towards Golf.Tappy concludes: «It would be appropriate to work on a balance here.»
According to the Swiss, restrictions are legitimate not least because the competition is not fair.Golf carriers could operate around the clock at their home at their home, did not pay taxes or social security contributions and would not have to deal with increasing fees.In Europe, the trend is exactly the opposite: longer night flight locks, lack of capacities, increasing stress.
This development is at risk that Europe will pop off from the large traffic and trade flows and in future only be peripheral.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation shares this assessment.The airports Zurich and Geneva and the Swiss therefore recently commissioned the risks of Swiss aviation to show in detail.
Measures are to be taken on the basis of these analyzes.It is already clear that a state assumption of the sovereign security costs of the airports and investments in training in aviation are discussed.Zurich and region, page 17

Accept instead of anticipating / / by Peter Bodenmann _ Tax evasion secret away, noise away, traffic jam...The
Problems of SBB and the clogged motorways dissolve in warm air after 2020.Switzerland cannot anticipate, but only accept.But that quickly, as the example of the tax evader secret teaches.
In the meantime, thanks to Snowden, the last tired warrior should be clear: the Americans have long since known everything.The NSA does not miss an account movement and no telephone sex.
The Yankees only demand the data from Swiss banks to cover up that they already have it.And now the surprise: the Swiss people accept tax evasion less and less.The normative power of the de facto has structured consciousness.
Soon we will be proud to have invented the abolition of the tax evaders themselves.Can political rights at least save the flat -rate taxation?This is after the NZZ has explained how the pig system works using the example of a Real in Stansstad.
Rather not .Our highways are constantly clogged.The SBB are in the crisis.
The maintenance is financially out of hand.Bombardier cannot deliver ordered double-decker compositions.The ticket prices rise continuously.
From 2020, quiet, buzzing electric cars will be the new technical standard.Driverless electric robots reduce the energy consumption per vehicle to one third.
And triple the capacity of the road network without adding.The boundaries between public and private traffic disappear.If the train is too expensive, the equally environmentally friendly street takes over.
Taxes by means of high taxes would have to go in and out of Google, Mercedes and Volvo in the offices of the once busy head of the Federal Office of Transport.The foreseeable result of all projections: Mobility becomes the horror of the green environmentally friendly and cheaper.The example of heavy traffic proves: Controlling successfully can be controlled by means of high control.
Cars with Swiss at the wheel need three times more street space than robot cars from 2022.Logical consequence: You have to pay three times more taxes from 2022.And we can breathe a sigh of relief and sleep calmly.
The old ones without permis become Dr.Füglistaler - shortly before he retires.We Swiss cannot anticipate, but can quickly accept.To ask the rhetorical question shortly afterwards: “Who has’ s

South is said to swallow half of the approaches / / Bern-Belp · Less noise, fewer environmental pollution: from the perspective of the authorities and the airport, southern approach almost only brings advantages.
The case is clear to the authorities: The planned southern flights to Bern-Belp Airport will not cause additional noise and environmental pollution."On the contrary, fewer people will be affected by aircraft noise in the future," says Urs Holderegger, spokesman for the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL).
Even in the Emmental and in the Oberland there will be no “significant increase in stress”.Airport operator Alpar wants to enable the satellite -based south approach.The new regime is to be introduced in spring 2015.
The plans will be opened in Belp, Münsingen and Bern from Monday (see also box). Joy in Bernim North of the Airport, the planned southern approach is taken into account."With the new arrival regime, the city of Bern and the UNESCO World Heritage Site are relieved," said the Bern municipal council yesterday.The densely populated area is now flowned at a low height, which is a major security risk.
In the south, however, many communities fear additional noise."We will have to make a lot of preparation," says Wichtrachs Mayor.Private flying also feels pushed to the edge (edition of yesterday). Education Necessary basis for the noise calculations is the subject plan infrastructure of aviation.
As far as the number of flight movements are concerned, it is based on 2011. At that time, around 59,000 flight movements were registered in Belpmoos, with around 7,000 movements on line flights fell.Roughly calculated, this made an average of around ten starts and ten landings a day.
Around 9,500 scheduled flight movements are forecast for 2020."In the initial phase from next year, most landings are likely to take place via north," says Holderegger.Because the planes would have to be equipped first and the pilots should be trained.
And in the event of a thong, the approach will continue to take place via north.After the initial phase, however, the north and the south should share the approaches about - six to seven per day.The airport is already occasionally flown from the south.
Bern, Muri, Allmendingen and Rubigen would be flown - much deeper than on the planned southern approach, says Holderegger.In the future, Wichtrach will be overflowed at an altitude of 440 meters above the ground (see graphic). The authorized person is entitled to criticize the criticism of representatives of the SantaViatic from the BAZL's point of view.The Swiss Hangegreilerverband and the Switzerland Aeroclub have already announced their resistance.
You feel pushed on the edge."Commercial traffic has a priority compared to private flying," says Urs Holderegger.The northern sector of Thun airfield can also only be used to a limited extent in the future.
Airport operator Alpar will be out for her plans on Tuesday.Not only for the new arrival regime, but also for a new, fourth expansion stage.A new roller path and storage space for aircraft are to be built in the Belpmoos.
Johannes Reichen "Commercial traffic has a priority compared to private aviation." Bazl spokesman Urs Holderggerlichtemlichtamit The airport can be controlled by instrument flight, various light signals are necessary in the south-mentioned in the AVIATIC language.According to the application, four new light masts will show the way to the landing slope.The first is located at the Münsingen motorway service area, the last one at the Belper ice cream district.

For the airfield, the air is thin / / / thun · The new southern approach to Bern-Belp Airport brings advantages for the Bern region, but the Thun region has to expect drastic consequences.
For the airfield Thun and private flying, the air becomes very thin. «It is pure conjunction.»Heinz Lang does not take a leaf out of his mouth when he talks about the planned southern flights to Bern-Belp Airport (see editions of the last two days).For the president of the group for classic cars and self-built aircraft Thun (Gost), the GPS-based approaches are one thing above all: a prestige project.
"The focus is not on security thoughts, but considerations of distributing the noise differently," says Lang.Basically, however, it is about the expansion of Bern-Belp Airport.The aim is to attract more and more and larger planes to Belp.
Is there more noise? "We would have to live with considerable restrictions," predicts the Gost President.The main problem is the expansion of airspace for Bern-Belp Airport.«Small flying is pushed to the edge.»
It takes a permit from Belp to fly through the protected airspace.Communication with the tower takes place in English."Not all hobbypilots or flight students can communicate perfectly," says Lang.
This requires an English exam.The consequence of this is that it dodged the protected airspace - for example downwards if this is possible.The consequences are clear:
The population will be faced with significantly more aircraft noise.The minimum flight height is 300 meters over the populated area and 150 meters."If you only look at the noise of the scheduled aircraft, it is only half the truth," says Lang, thus putting the statement of Urs Holderegger, spokesman for the Federal Office for Civil Aviation.
In connection with the application of the airfield operator Bern, Alpar AG, he had expressed himself as follows: "In the future, fewer people will be affected by aircraft noise." Will it be dangerous?Whether security in the sky is increasing due to the new approach routes.«The airspace for private flying is significantly smaller.
And this increases the risk that something will happen.»For the pilots of the line jets, on the other hand, the previous city or romeo-circle approach, in which a landing from the south takes place after a turn over ruby and Münsingen, is routine.If the airspace for the line flights to Bern-Belp is reserved as intended, a crossing from east to west for flights is significantly more difficult.
“So far, it was possible to fly around the Bern control zone without any major problems.Now the pilots would have to move further towards Oberland to avoid the reserved airspace.On the one hand, there is Thun, and on the other hand, the high mountains can pose a danger, »says Lang.
Basically, the airspace can be flown through with permission from Belp, provided there are no instrument flights nearby."But there is already a regular cancellation," says Lang."If the traffic from and to Bern-Belp increases, the situation will worsen, and only the way towards Oberland remains." Airfield
Thun before?The home of the group for classic cars and self -built aircraft Thun and the small aircraft is the Thun airfield.There you are also little built about the plans of the Alpar.
«This is only about profit and profiling.And the general public may pay the price for this, »says Christopher Clarke, President of the Thun airfield association.With the new control zones, a flight from the north is made possible to the Thun airfield.
"The effects will feel the population," says Clarke.The approach from the north took place via the A 6 and caused practically no additional noise.«Now the pilots are forced to use a new route.»
That would hardly come across a mutual love in the communities west of Thun.«A peaceful coexistence with those who are bothered by aircraft noise is important to us.With the new control zone, the good ratio is strained with the population.»
And Clarke goes even further: «Thun airfield is an important place for glider competitions and also for training.»A lot is now being questioned with the new regime."So that Swiss continues to sit in the cockpit of a line jet, you need opportunities where you can be trained," says Clarke."

The Lufthansa Group transports more passengers / / SCO.·
The figures published by various airlines on the transported passengers and the loading of the aircraft for 2013 are majority and reflect a recovery of demand.In 2013, the Lufthansa Group transported almost 1 % more passengers with 104 million than in the previous year.Of these, 17 million flew with the Swiss, which means growth of 0.5 %.
The Swiss subsidiary cuts better within the group in terms of occupancy.In 2013, this was significantly higher with 83.3 % (+0.9 percentage points compared to the previous year) than the group average of 79.8 % (+1 percentage point).The titles of the Lufthansa Group were in demand on Friday, the course rose by over 8 % in the course of the afternoon.
Reason to optimism also gave statements by CFO Simone Menne in a presentation published on the Internet for an investor seminar in New York.Accordingly, she expects lower fuel costs for 2014 and confirmed the goal of € 600 million to € 700 million for 2013.Easy Jet (+3.6 % to 61 million) and Air France-KLM (+1 % to 78 million) transported more passengers.Air Berlin, on the other hand, recorded fewer passengers ( - 5 % to 32 million).
The second largest German airline was able to improve to 85 % in the case of 84 % in the previous year.The other companies that have already published their traffic figures managed to fill their aircraft better than in the previous year.The range ranged from +0.4 (Easy Jet, to 89 %) to +0.6 percentage points (Air France-KLM, to 84 %).

Swiss in the security ranking of all airlines in 32 / / air traffic 2013 has proven to be one of the safest years in the history of aviation.Despite an ever denser crowd in the sky, the large societies of disasters have been largely spared.
The number of dangerous incidents remains worrying.Around 100 years after the start of the first line machine, flying is at least statistically as safe as it rarely before.Whether European Air Safety Agency or Independent accident researchers, they all come to the same conclusion:
The likelihood of falling with an airplane has become extremely low.According to a balance of the German database JACDEC, 251 people worldwide were killed in the civil aviation accidents last year.For comparison: In the first half of 2013, 113 people died on the Swiss streets.
Swiss makes a place Gutdie the safest airline in the world is the Air New Zealand, followed by the Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong.Measured against traffic performance and incidents, they displaced the Finnair, which is now flying to 3rd place.
Europeans in the top ten are still British Airways (5) and the Portuguese TAP (7).With Emirates (4), Etihad Airways (8) and Qatar Airways (11), three Arab airlines land at the top.The Swiss improved from 33th to 33th, while Lufthansa, whose group belongs to the Swiss, fell from 11th to 18th to 18th place.
The JACDEC statisticians take into account the total losses and serious incidents of the past 30 years for their data.It was the incidents that mixed up the extremely closely close group in the JacDec list of the 60 safest airlines in 2013.In 2013, it did not lack it - even if, as through a miracle, they mostly went out of light.

In airspace over Thun, it could be tight "" does not bring greater security "to the arrogance of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation without wanting to realize the" new "southern approach without prior contact with the affected communities and all the various pilots.When I learned to fly almost 50 years ago, solutions were sought in the dialog and not with the power of the stronger.Even die -hard professional pilots (Swiss and military) do not recognize greater security in southern approach.
The opposite is the case: after an English pilot colleague after a southern approach to Belpmoos, I told me that he was choked how close the Belpberg was in the weather conditions that were not ideal at that time!Maybe you should move the Belpberg for the time being.

The health insurance company has the principle of "one for everyone, all for you".Pregnancies are also part of the diseases, with all the resulting consequences such as abortions.The health insurance principle does not matter whether abortions are ethically justifiable for the individual or not.
I also finance alcoholic diseases with my premiums, which I honestly don't want to co -finance, and still have to do this out of the principle of solidarity.I cannot understand if Ms. Bader describes alcohol addiction as a disease that can be healed or alleviated, and with an abortion where the costs are much lower, no.In addition, there is her attitude that you should not abort because you kill life.
This setting no longer corresponds to today's age.Should a child grow up in a situation that is not durable for the mother?We are not entitled to judge the situation of the individual woman during an abortion.

Abortion initiative “Symphealic arguments” With today's deadlines, all women in Switzerland have access to legal, professional abortion.No cheap bushes have to be risked.With the assumption of costs of the health insurance companies, the same right is guaranteed for everyone.
The hypocritical argument of cost reductions in healthcare from “holy” circles is unacceptable.Social diseases such as alcoholism, obesity or lack of exercise with subsequent diseases, our system affect billions annually.There, no rooster screams on personal responsibility and cause principle.
I am sure that the social phenomena just mentioned have been caused themselves.Consequently, one should no longer finance a liver transplant by an alcoholic, but this would be absolute nonsense.The assumption of the initiative “Abortion financing is a private matter” would mainly make financially and socially disadvantaged women who are already in a difficult situation.

No home protection for the Swiss / / / It is remarkable: the Swiss like to complain about aircraft noise and make life difficult for the industry with restrictions.
If the competition from abroad laughs into the feather and thanks to a strong base at the home airports can be aggressively pushed into the Swiss market, the applause is large over good prices, tasty sandwichs and pretty flight attackers-and the ridicule over the Swiss Süss.This is what happened last week when the SWISS shot a warning light on the occasion of the A380 golf airline Emirates in Zurich.She complained to a long time with the competition from Dubai or in the case of Etihad from Abu Dhabi and asked the federal government to restrict traffic rights, assume security costs and invest in training (NZZ 9. 1. 14).
The call for the state seems strange.Nevertheless, it would be too easy to dismiss the swiss's initiative as a cry of jealousy.It is actually the case that European aviation in global competition gets on the defensive.
However, the answer to this must not be protected: to limit traffic rights is the wrong way.It is not to blame the Gulf States that they have recognized the importance of aviation.However, it is necessary that this knowledge is also established in Europe and Switzerland - and the framework conditions are improved.
Landes airports fight with bottlenecks. The Swiss aviation is fine.In the still valid aviation policy report from 2004, the Federal Council declared the primary goal of ensuring the optimal connection between Switzerland to the European and worldwide centers.Aviation is of an outstanding economic importance, which is why its competitiveness should be promoted.
No sheikh of the golf could formulate it better - only the effect of the report in Switzerland has remained in Switzerland.A study by the Intraplan planning office from 2012 illustrated how an aviation is treated without an aviation.the strongest is damaged.
The disadvantages in Switzerland with regard to capacity, operating times and fees are particularly drastic.The state airports Zurich and Geneva are missing at capacity limits - scenarios for expansion.Zurich as the most significant Swiss hub also has the most unfavorable operating hours of all important European airports with a night's sleep from 11:00 p.m. to 6 a.m.
The aviation industry is also disadvantaged in terms of noise and safety costs.The former are above average, the latter are largely worn by the state in other European countries.Swiss must
Quality Beagering List shows: Not too relaxed allocation of traffic rights burdens the industry, but the tight corset.The Swiss does not have any homeland protection, and support is not opportunities related to certain airlines.
However, improving the framework conditions for everyone is urgent.At the top of the list of priorities it says that answers to the capacity bottlenecks are found.In Zurich this means that the approach and departure regime must be simplified.
It would be justifiable on the cost side that the state will cover the sovereign security costs that are incurred for police surveillance and patrol trips in the context of fighting terrorism.The demand for investments in training for AVIATIC professions also seems legitimate, especially since they are intended in the Aviation Act.From a Swiss perspective, the fact that the Swiss would benefit disproportionately from such measures.
The reference to the German ownership is smaller.If the Swiss had to clear the field, competitors would certainly cover certain connections.However, it is foreseeable that many direct flights fell away and that traffic would be increasingly led over other hubs.
Direct connections are central to the economy.A free flight into a better world is not available for Swiss aviation, but also with modified framework conditions.The fact that companies in Switzerland have higher costs than in other areas of the world is not unusual.
You have to make up for this disadvantage with more innovative services and higher productivity in order to be able to survive in global competition.The industry and especially the Swiss is required to adapt the business model of the new competitive situation and to improve the quality of your own offer.The negative public reactions to the outcry of the Swiss out last week indicate that there is a need for action.

Letters to the editor / / edition of January 10 to «South of the approaches should swallow» “Large episodes» by 2020, according to forecasts, 200,000 passengers a year.This means that so that 200,000 people can fly abroad comfortably once a year, 300,000 people should be disturbed and stressed every day.
That is economic nonsense.The destinations are primarily holiday resorts.Thanks to the SBB, as well as the airports Kloten, Basel and Geneva, it is possible to fly everywhere, without greater loss of time.
There are no major money savings.Economically, the benefits are low to negative.It would make more sense to improve the utilization of the three existing airports instead of "diluting" passengers at regional airports. The idea that noise, like chemicals, was simply "diluted".
A small noise immission also has a large -scale consequences.It is of no use that the quality of life is now reduced both in the city and in the country.In spatial planning, one speaks of «compression.»
This should also apply to air traffic.Aldo Matteucci, Muri near Bern «Schieflung the nerves», Munich Booksee and Zollikofen never whined because of the approach on.And it is not a grinder in Lorraine either, but you get used to it because the planes are much quieter compared to other cities.
Only the flights across the old town, so just over the roofs, is not without risk.If they are diverted elsewhere, this makes a significant contribution to calming the nerves, because you shouldn't think about what could happen over Bern if a crash.Peter Brönnimann, Flamatt edition from January 13th "City Council decides on a new entry on the Schönusteg" "Why simply if it is expensive?" It is difficult to understand that a simple access staircase should be replaced by a luxury solution with costs of CHF 440,000.
Why is the traffic not separated as usual?Divide the bridge lengthways into three sections and mark accordingly: first third (left) for swimmers, second third (center) for jumpers and the third part (right) for boaters, everything is clearly visible outside and inside.
But why simply when it is recommended and elaborately recommended by "experts"?Fritz König, Münsingen edition from January 10 to "Grosshöchstetten: Tempo 30 will soon replace the yellow strips?" "Tempo 30 is not an ultimate solution" I've been living in Grosshöchstetten for eight years.
During this time I also noticed that through traffic has increased.And the traffic situation at Landi is certainly unhappy and not entirely harmless.Nevertheless, I believe that Tempo 30 is not the ultimate solution.
Soon the cars across the country can only drive at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, except for a motorway.The backlog with the districts will certainly not be shorter in rush times.The government makes us citizens properly extinguish driving.
My proposal would be: build less elaborate roundabouts and do without other, so -called traffic -calming measures and give a bike to all road users - depending on the budget with or without an engine.Verena Meyer, Grosshöchstetten edition from January 13 to "Additional income provides Zoff" "What is other than rip -off?"

The southern approach should be better for the environment / / airport operator Alpar sees only advantages in the planned southern approach.There will be neither more flight movements nor more noise, she asserts.
In addition, the new procedure is much safer.The Alpar wants to invest millions of francs - also in new infrastructure on the airport area.The protest took place immediately.
"No further extensions for private jets at Bern-Belp Airport" wrote the association against aircraft noise yesterday in a media release.With the planned southern approach, the airport's attractiveness increases.And with the fourth expansion stage, additional air traffic will go hand in hand.
With similar arguments, the VCS of the canton of Bern also rejects the expansion and the planned southern approach.The two associations reacted to the latest announcements by the airport operator Alpar.No problem
Monday the airport's plans for the southern trips and the expansion are publicly available.Yesterday the Alpar oriented the media and the presidents of the surrounding communities about their plans.No problem, the tenor was.
According to the airport director Mathias Häberli, the planned satellite -based southern approach is more environmentally friendly and reducing (see interview). There will be no more flight movements with the implementation of the plans, said Häberli.Around 58,000 flight movements are currently being carried out annually on the Belpmoos.According to the provisions, it may be a maximum of 75,000.
"This number is made in stone," said Peter Jaberg, project manager from the engineering office Bächtold & Moor.Another number is decisive for the amount of future southern flights: the almost 23,400 movements per year, which are carried out in Bern-Belp according to instrument flight rules.
These approaches naturally make up half, i.e. 11,700 movements."Almost 30 percent of this will take place via south in the future," said Jaberg.That would be 3,300 flights, i.e. 8 to 10 approaches per day.
The Federal Office for Civil Aviation, on the other hand, spoke of half of the approaches from the south last week.Weather -related southern approach today today land from the south depending on the weather.
They break off their hint north and fly a tight curve to the airport via Muri and rubble.On average, around 5 flights took place a day, said Peter Jaberg.The accessibility in west wind or clouds is better from the south.
According to Alpar, the costs for the new instrument approach system are CHF 1.8 to CHF 2 million.However, the federal government will take over part of these expenses through the fuel reimbursement.The application for support was approved, said airport director Häberli.
Some of the invited presidents of the municipalities around the airport were alerted.Above all, the Mayor of Münsingen Beat Moser (Greens), whose community is flowned on to the southern approach to a height of only around 300 meters.The population is literally startled and the building administration has been overrun by people in the past few days who want to find out about the plans, said Moser.
The airport managers assured the mayor to invite them to a conversation at the round table and were also ready to participate in information events in the communities.The southern approach will be planned from 2015/2016.Laura
Fehlmann · Johannes Reichen approach from the south: Alpar explains the reasons for the new arrival regime.
Reactions from tuna bilder flying through the new arrival regime extends the Bern-Belp airport control zone to Thun.Heinz Lang, President of the Gost (group for classic cars and self -built aircraft), predicts that small flying at Thun airfield is pushed to the edge.
"The Thun airfield is just outside this zone," contradicts Adrian Schüpbach, Head of Air Trailer Bern, at yesterday's media conference.«The operation can be continued normally.»According to Alpar, the populated areas in the Aaretal should not be overwhelmed by aircraft noise.
The noise limit values would continue to apply.It is still open how it goes for paragliders and delta sailors who start from the Falkenfluh.Yesterday it was only confirmed that they are affected by the changes and that their operation will be “restricted” depending on the flight altitude.
The discomfort and the need for information among the mayor of the Aaretal and the Thun region were clearly felt. GsBflenflughaf wants to grow investors for the expansion in southern BIS at CHF 4 million, Alpar wants to invest in a new infrastructure in the south.So that companies later settle there.The airport operator Alpar not only presented the plans for southern approach yesterday, but also her ideas for the fourth expansion stage.
Even if those responsible prefer to speak of an expansion rather than an expansion - the appearance of the airport would change fundamentally either way.Because the Alpar wants to build new systems south of the existing start and landing slopes.The primary goal is to unknown the different types of transport, said airport director Mathias Häberli.
That is why the line, charter and business traffic should be located in the north.The south, on the other hand, is reserved for training and glider flights, for helicopters and tourist flights.The capacity of the airport is to be enlarged with this division.
In a first phase, the Alpar wants to invest CHF 2 to 4 million.A new storage space of 23,000 square meters is to be built for aircraft, as well as a roller train between the northern and the southern part.It is planned that the new airport area will be opened up via Muri and Selhofenstrasse and the new industrial road that will soon be created.
New buildings are also to be built in a second phase.A new area of 36,000 square meters should be available for offices, hangars and workshops.Investors are sought for this.
According to Alpar, there are already interested parties, such as companies in the aircraft maintenance or operators of business jets.The Alpar is based on many new jobs.According to spokesman Daniel Steffen, 550 to 600 full -time positions are available in Belpmoos.
“In the future, it could be up to 1000 full -time positions.»The expansion also has an impact on nature - that's why the Alpar has to ensure numerous replacement measures such as hedges or flower -rich meadows.And he has consequences for the glider pilots - a starting slope and a landing field fall away.

New record, old worries / / by Rahel Koerfgenbasel.After 2012, the EuroAirport (EAP) can also show a record for the past year:
With almost 5.9 million passengers, the binational airport recorded an increase of ten percent.Easyjet was once again by far the strongest airline: almost 3.2 million flew with the cheap airline, which corresponds to an increase of 17 percent and means a market share of 54 percent.
That of Swiss and her mother Lufthansa is five percent each.Airport director Jürg Rämi said that the flight movements have remained stable despite increasing number of passengers.This means that the occupancy of the aircraft could be improved.
The EAP is also aiming for a record in 2014: Jürg Rämi assumes five percent to a total of 6.2 million passengers.However, hope for a new freight terminal of the freight business.While the Swiss export industries presented excellent numbers year after year, the freight numbers at the EAP remained stable in 2013.
However, the full freight business decreased by six percent."Our today's cargo system is not ideal, especially for the export of pharmaceutical products, because the required controlled temperature guidance is missing," said Rämi.He therefore does not expect growth in the freight business in the current year.
Andreas Büttiker, BLT director and Vice President of the EuroAirport since August 2013, was accordingly dissatisfied."But we should be able to grow again in the coming year." Büttiker's hopes are justified: In autumn 2014, the EuroAirport will put the new Cargo Terminal into operation.
"This can better meet the needs of regional export companies," said Rämi.The infrastructure of the new terminal is significantly better than the old one: Among other things, constant cooling necessary for the storage of pharmaceutical products, and the connections to the road network are ideal.
The EAP invests a total of 40 million euros in the new terminal.Five anchor tenants with a contract for five years have already been obliged, including Swissport and Cargologic.Around 70 percent of the system is thus rented out, as EAP spokeswoman Vivienne Gaskell confirms the BAZ.
At Interpharma in Basel, the Association of Researching Pharmaceutical Companies in Switzerland, the opening of the new freight terminal is welcomed."As the most important export industry in Switzerland, the pharmaceutical industry is dependent on a good transport infrastructure," says spokeswoman Sara Käch.It is crucial that pharmaceutical products could be transported without quality loss.
However, the local pharmaceutical companies cannot yet say what concrete effects the new Cargo Terminal will have on the frequency and routes for product transport."At the moment we use numerous routes by street and air, the latter also about hubs such as Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich," says Novartis spokesman Satoshi Sugimoto.Roche also uses the same hubs.

A lot of comfort on board and a stroke of special class / / with the daily use of the Airbus A380, which can record 517 passengers, Emirates has increased the capacity on the Zurich - Dubai route by 1140 seats per week.The attention that the giant bird Airbus A380 on and around Zurich Airport has to share Singapore Airlines, the first operator of the aircraft for this destination, with Emirates since the beginning of the year.
The airline from the United Arab Emirates wraps one of the two daily flights (that in the afternoon) after their home base Dubai no longer with the Boeing 777, but with the A380.Emirates has thus increased the daily capacity from Zurich around 163 seats.14 First Class and 76 Business Class seats are offered on the upper deck, and 427 EconomyClass places on the Lower Deck.
Self-run A380WAS in view of the additionally created competition in the Central East and Generally in the long-distance business of the management of the Swiss worries lines (NZZ 9. 1. 13), fulfills the Emirates managers with pride.Thierry Aucoc, who is commercially responsible for the traffic areas of Europe and Russia, indicates the high booking stands on the Zurich - Dubai route, even after the capacity increase.
The A380, which numerous Emirates customers have approved for years, proves to be a magnet that generates additional traffic.In addition to the repeated success factors of the airline, which was founded in 1985 (almost no tax liability, deeper personnel costs than in Europe and the USA, ideal geographical location of the Dubai turnstile and 24-hour operation of the same without restrictions), AUCOC knows from further trumps.The fact that the fleet Grosso Modo only consists of two series of types (Airbus A380 and Boeing 777) reduce the effort in maintenance and crew management.
Thanks to the low average age of the aircraft of around six years with a correspondingly moderate fuel consumption, less than others are suffering from the currently high kerosene prices (which still cause almost 40 percent of the expenditure).The very customer -friendly and efficient hub in Dubai, which was designed as such, was also the plus point.The latest achievement is the Concourse A, a pure, 650 meter long A380 terminal with 20 (two-story) gates and 13 outside positions.
For travelers in ridge and business class, direct boarding from the luxurious lounges- with over 4000 seats, the largest in the world- is possible.The importance of these facilities is all the higher than 60 percent of the passengers arriving in Dubai - also from Switzerland - continue their trip here.Among other things, Emirates focuses on routes that nobody else offers, such as ten destinations in India and five in Pakistan.
This would open up new customer classes for air traffic.And what do the other 40 percent do?Dubai is greatly underestimated as a travel destination, says Aucoc.
The small Emirate on the Persian Gulf, which was visited by 10 million guests last year, has now been in tenth in the worldwide ranking of the city destinations.In 2020, 20 million visitors are to be welcomed in the course of the recently awarded world exhibition.The attractions are constantly becoming more, not only with the gigantic shopping malls, but also in sports, nature experiences-desert, sea-and last but not least with architecture highlights.
The biggest “kitchen” of the global like does it feel on board course EK (Emirates) 088 from ZRH to DXB?A “test flight” in the business class confirms the high comfort of the A380.The noise level is unusually deep behind the wings, small turbulence is almost gone.Emirates has had a lot of effort in the on-board entertainment systems with over a thousand channels and in telecommunications (Wi-Fi, mobile phone and data services;
SMS and email work perfectly).The tastefully furnished bar in the upper deck then prepares fun.The food is of really excellent quality.
We believe that we know the reason for this after visiting the Emirates Flight Catering Center: Here, in the allegedly largest "kitchen" in the world, which has recently expelled the record number of 157 300 meals with 500 employees for the menu preparation, everything will really beTo the smallest chocolate decor for the desserts, freshly prepared.A challenge is the recruitment of cabin staff for Emirates with a traffic growth of 15 and more percent a year.
Around 8,600 flight attendants today work on the A380.It may be that we experienced an outer on the return flight.Despite all the friendliness, the service between the individual crew members did not seem well coordinated, the time management for the meals got off the solution on the six-hour trip.

"Flying has always fascinated me," says Meisser, who had discovered the glider fly as a teenager through his father.However, the 54-year-old regrets that he failed because of the military pilot training.But his skills were always suitable for drag pilot for glider pilots.
And now your own plane.Since he had ordered the kit in the USA and unpacked in a former factory on the Binzareeal, 17 years have passed.During this time he worked tirelessly on his project.
This was hardly worth it financially: he invested an estimated CHF 130,000 in the material alone.In addition, the rent for the workshop and other expenses came.
A comparable plane from the bar would be available for around CHF 200,000. "A focused activity" was primarily concerned with the manual, says Meisser.«It is a very focused activity.»In contrast to his everyday work as an architect, which he often experiences as something bogged down between emails, phone calls and meetings.
He had acquired the first craft knowledge as a boy in his father's carpentry.He gradually suited the rest."You learn from each other," says Meisser, who, like all self -builders, is organized in the Association of Experimental Aviation Switzerland (EAS).
EAS building consultants, including aircraft engineers, ensure that the standards are adhered to, and the designers are at the side of the designers.On behalf of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation, EAS takes over the control of the safety regulations until traffic approval.Now he is there, the elegant, silver bird.
On the private airfield in Birrfeld in Aargau, the formwork shimmers discreetly in the bowl of sunlight.The freshly baked aircraft owner smiles proudly.You can no longer see the complicated technical interior.
The sun can narrowly penetrate the fog.No flight weather.But Meisser did not get to Birrfeld to fly.
Because the gasoline display has failed, he has to remove the wings again and search for the cause in his workshop.The light aircraft with a economical engine needs normal car gasoline.It consumes seven liters over 100 kilometers - just a little more than an average new car.
The experimental flying regularly made technical progress, some of which would be taken over by commercial companies, explains Meisser.It points to the small aircraft, which stand on the floor in the Hangar Birrfeld Hangar or float them on platforms.Like insects.
Many of the aviators are the actual classic cars with a 40 -year -old technology, says Meisser.Your consumption values are correspondingly higher.The fuel, which is housed in the wings, is enough for around 1000 kilometers of flight.
Theoretically, because practically pilot Meisser is not allowed to leave Switzerland.He only has the start and landing permit for the airfields Birrfeld and Bad Ragaz.It is located in the elaborate test phase.
Within 40 hours he has to fly a prescribed program, observed by experts who evaluate the data.Then he has to submit extensive documentation.Andreas Meisser will soon be finished.
Now he dreams of Europe.He has already planned flights to France and Poland.Andreas Meisser carefully strips the protective cover from the wing of his self -made aircraft.

Attention, traffic jams in the air / / pilot throughout Europe will resign from work in the coming days.They defend themselves against “unrealistic savings pressure”.
Your Swiss colleagues support you.Pia Wertheimer all over Europe defend the pilots against the planned performance requirements of the EU Commission.You have announced that today and on Thursday, partially to put down your work, which will affect air traffic.
«We protest against the unrealistic savings pressure, which is imposed on us.It is based on false traffic forecasts and endangers flight safety, »says Mario Winiger, spokesman for the Swiss pilot union Aerocontrol.The EU Commission assumes that air traffic will increase by 50 percent over the next 20 years.
It therefore expects the fees of the flight protection to increase.With the additional money, they should increase their capacities.In addition, the EU Commission is demanding greater efficiency. "However, the latest figures show that air traffic decreases, especially in Central Europe," says Vladi Barrosa, spokesman for the Skyguide air traffic control.
In 2013, the Swiss checked 1.14 million instrument flights, which corresponds to a decline of 2.5 percent compared to the previous year.The decline is comparable to the aircraft that only fly through Swiss airspace.Skyguide justifies this with the economic situation.
On the other hand, the airlines operate with ever larger aircraft to promote the increasing number of passengers.However, the flight frequencies decrease.The federal government would have to punish numbers, when the EU provides, according to Barrosa, the fee revenues that raise skyguide in the event of hunt, landings and starts would decrease.
“At the same time, the EU demands that we save.“If the flight controls do not comply with the EU's performance requirements, they must be accountable for this.In these cases, the corresponding state threatens fines.
"In turn, the federal government could concern air traffic control," says the Skyguide spokesman.While the flight caners put their work in the neighboring countries at different times, Skyguide employees will only take part in the campaign."We are not allowed to go on strike, but we support our colleagues abroad," says trade unionist Winiger.
The Skyguide employees will pass on the aircraft in Switzerland at the planned flight heights to the neighbors.The possible changes in the altitude, which the pilots ask for spontaneously in everyday life, are only an option during the campaign during the campaign.Skyguide himself condemns the strike campaign:
«Third parties are damaged.However, we support the demand of the various pilot associations, »says Barrosa.Skyguide demands balanced and realistic performance goals from the EU.
«The requirements must also meet regional developments.“Aviation does not develop the same everywhere.The Baltic countries currently experienced a boom that Central Europe knew twenty years ago.
"In the heart of the continent, air traffic has been declining steadily for several years." The Swiss has no understanding of the action of the pilots.The airline has already canceled eight flights on Tuesday.More could follow.
"It is not acceptable that the strike is held on the back of the passengers," says Swiss spokeswoman Sonja Ptask.Especially because it is a politically motivated action.The harmonization of European airspace sought by the EU Commission is an important core pillar for its better use.
"Swiss supports and supports the project." Directly flights move traffic pilot spokesman Winiger in this point are agreed with her: "The flight paths are often defined by government interests and are therefore not directly impossible.»
The “motorway network in the sky” is specified.Every plane that uses it pays for it."However, the desired direct flights shift the traffic and thus the income," says Winiger.
Belgium is particularly affected by this.For the air traffic control there, the EU plans would result in their income drops drastically.Skyguide, on the other hand, has developed a good position on the market in terms of possible liberalization of European airspace.
"However, we need the future -oriented projects that are now threatened by the savings specifications in order to keep this position." Last autumn, a large majority of the member states rejected the plans of the EU Commission at the last round of negotiations - includingSwitzerland .Skyguide now calls for the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) that on February 4th it will pound realistic goals at the next round of negotiations.According to Bazl spokeswoman Martine Reymond, the Swiss representative will not have any voting rights.
"But of course he will take part in the discussion." The European towers are affected by strikes today and tomorrow.Photo: Reuterstagellang strikwann The air traffic control is out of the air traffic controller in various European countries in the next few days.This also indirectly affects Switzerland:
In Italy, the pilots for Wednesday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. and on Thursday from 3 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. called for the strike.In Portugal, air traffic manager resigns from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.In Slovakia, the flight can be strike between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
In Hungary there is also a two -hour strike between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.The Greeks will go on strike on January 30 from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.How the French air traffic control took part in the campaign was still unclear until the time of going to press.
The pilots originally planned a five -day strike.After talking to the political representatives, they shortened their action because they have undertaken to stand up for the concerns of the flight protection.The French now catch a strike from Wednesday evening, 7 p.m. to Friday morning at 5 a.m.

A fendant, fresh like the morning dew / from Chandra Kurtich sit on the plane again.Towards San Francisco.
Of course I fly with Swiss International Air Lines - my favorite airline.The captain has just explained that the flight will be shorter than usual today, since we got into air flows that accelerate the rivers like tearing rivers.I also learned that the plane has the mobility of a tree leaf in the autumn storm.
How calming, I think.Despite a number of flight experience, I always feel the same - I am more stable on the ground than in the air.Whiskey and songs from Burt Bacharach give me the strength to enjoy the moment and not to collapse in airy despair.
In front of me the whole Swiss wine range that is currently served on board.On board a Swiss machine, a chef from another canton cooks every three months as part of “Swiss Taste of Switzerland”.At the moment the Valais is on board, and the chefs are Heidi and Franz Hueby from the «Findlerhof» in Zermatt (www.findlerhof.ch).
Last winter season I was in her restaurant and funnily hit half a dozen old schoolmates.We spoke of the past and drank Valais wine-the fendant of Marie-Thérèse Chappaz.The wine was so tasty that we emptied all the week.
Marie-Thérèse is now one of the most famous winemakers in Switzerland.In addition to their top sweet wines, I love their fendant.He is tasty, unpretentious and so fresh that he delights the palate in no time.
He is also the pure opposite of Marie-Thérèse's real talent, the sweet wines.It produces little of this palate, but it is worth discovering one, ideally after the palate has been avoided by its fendant.Fendant de Fully 2012, Côteaux de Plamont, Marie-Thérèse Chappaz, Fr. 24.80, Weinhandlung am Küferweg, Obfelden or Seonwww.kueferweg.chchandra Kurt is the author of the Guides “Weinseller” www.chandrakurt.com

Small player with Zurich affinity / / over 50 years ago, Adria Airways was founded as Yugoslavian company.The way to Slovenia's National Carrier was long.
The airline of privatization is still waiting. 85 600 travelers promoted Adria Airways from Ljubljana to Zurich last year.Compared to the point-to-point business of large competitors, this is not an excessive impressive number.For a small carrier like the Slovenian, however: the Zurich route, operated in the codeshare with Swiss, is for him with the second largest traffic-to Frankfurt-with growth of at least 14 percent last year.
Sometimes, Zvone Petek, General Manager Switzerland, admits that “First Minute” offers had also contributed to increased demand.Tourist potential for the good occupancy of the Zurich flights (in summer 20 a week, in winter reduction to 15) there are reasons, knows Petek, who also performs the function of the fee consumption in Zurich.Switzerland is the largest investor in Slovenia to Germany with several hundred companies involved.
In addition, the tourist market around Ljubljana, especially with special interest offers, such as bike and hiking holidays in nearby Istria and Carinthia.City frequencies (Ljubljana and Trieste or both combined) have also attracted lately.The CEO of Adria Airways, Mark Anzur, estimates the catchment area of the Ljubljana airport on around 5 million people (Slovenia has 2 million inhabitants).
It extends to Italy's northern Adriac coast, northern Croatia and the Austrian area Ennet the Karawanken.However, the whole thing is one and take: around 200,000 Slovenian travelers preferred to use Venice Airport - customers who try to regain with affordable prices.
The business model, as it describes it, sees the airline in the line business (traditionally also offered a large number of charter flights, especially in the Mediterranean space) because closer to low-cost and traditional carriers.In any case, the resolutions that are related to a restructuring program that was initiated after an economic break -in - over 60 million euros of loss in 2010.According to provisional assessments, the goal of creating the return to black by the end of 2013 has been narrowly missed.
More passengers (856 500 line, 170,000 charter, plus 5 percent) and a load of 73 percent (plus 6 percent) were registered. Fleet of eleven aircraftadria Airways is currently operating a fleet of eleven aircraft: an Airbus A320 - 200, mostly forCharter routes, two Airbus A319 - 100, four Bombardier CRJ200 and four Bombardier CRJ900.A few larger centers are flown in from Ljubljana in the line service, along with Zurich among other Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, Amsterdam, Paris, Moscow;In addition, smaller destinations in the Balkans.
Adria Airways is also active from Pristina in Kosovo (Frankfurt, Munich) and from this summer from Tirana (Prague and Brussels) .adria Airways was founded in 1961 as a pure charter airline, the first aircraft were four-engine piston aircraft DC-6B.In 1995 after the independence of Slovenia had created a completely new starting point from mid -1991, the transition to the network provider was completed.The Airline has been a full member of the Star Alliance since 2010.The majority belongs to the state.
In 2012 it was officially advertised for sale.Recently, resistance to the planned privatization has recently resisted in politics.A Canadair regional jet 900 is reflected in the windows of the Brnik Airport near Ljubljana.

"A yes would have massive consequences for Zurich Airport" / / rarely managers speak plain text before elections.Thomas Kern does it.
He designs a dark scenario - if the SVP wins.The SVP initiative comes to coordination at the weekend.How is the airport affected?
Thomas Kern: The airport lives from international passenger transport.The more people live in Switzerland, the higher the demand for flight services.With a yes there will be less growth in the future.
Today, narrow specialists, which we rely on Zurich Airport, could be rarer.What does this mean?We employ around 1,600 people at Zurich AG Airport.
A good hundred of them are highly specialized specialists from abroad.For example, project managers and specialists under construction, heating, ventilation, climate, but also in the area of IT.We do not find enough people from these specialists in Switzerland.
If the SVP initiative accepts the recruitment, it would be difficult.That's all ?If the bilateral I were subsequently terminated by the EU, then the almost unforeseeable consequences for Zurich Airport would have.
Would that mean that our homecarrier could no longer fly to Madrid, Paris or Frankfurt even though the Swiss belongs to Lufthansa?As unlikely that is: that could ultimately mean that.With the termination of bilateral I, the air traffic agreement could also fall away.
Then the landing rights would also be automatically omitted.This means that Switzerland has to negotiate it laboriously.Lufthansa could simply lead the traffic via Munich or Frankfurt.
Switzerland could certainly give a certain shift in traffic flows.But let's not forget: from Zurich today we have over 180 direct connections to the world, which contribute significantly to strengthening Switzerland.Two thirds of them take place within Europe.
These would then potentially endanger.Zurich Airport would then have to be redimated accordingly?It is clear that such - now almost unimaginable - development would have an impact on the size and capacity development of the airport, on jobs and investments.
Today, over 25,000 people work in 280 companies here, and we invest an average of CHF 1 million per working day.The added value from the airport system is CHF 6 billion per year.Do you really think that the consequences of a yes to the SVP initiative would be so serious?
There is a lot at stake.Even if it is difficult to imagine that the bilateral I and the air traffic agreement are simply terminated by the EU when the urn output is output.Nobody really knows.
When Swissair growned in 2001, it said that the airport could exist without national airline.Does this also apply in the event of termination of the aviation agreement?Airlines and an airport are required for the air traffic system system.
The Swiss as a homecarrier is responsible for ensuring that we can also meet our concession order, direct connections to the most important metropolises in the world.Without the Swiss or the loss of corresponding landing rights, the passenger could continue to fly from and from Zurich.He would do it or bad with other airlines.
Certainly, however, this would no longer be possible in today's quality and flight density.Rather ?Foreign airlines would certainly hardly operate a network of connections from Zurich, but only lucrative point-to-point connections.
That would be sensitive to Zurich Airport.Interview: René Lüchingerschonlicht's position assessment: Thomas Kern. «In the future there will be less growth in the future.»

Strike at Frankfurt / / Frankfurt Airport.Endlessly long snakes, annoyed passengers, emergency doctor missions:
The warning strike of the security inspectors fell in Turbulence to Frankfurt Airport yesterday.Many passengers who wanted to start the weekend are stuck or have to switch to the train.The problem is that the passengers do not get through the passenger control, here there are very long waiting times, said an airport spokesman.
Due to the work of work, only two thirds of the control stations are occupied.That is why guests missed their flights, many places in the machines remained empty.The situation spoke at noon:
Due to the passenger crowd, the access to the security controls was temporarily closed.Yesterday the airport operator Fraport calculated 150,000 passengers.According to the Fraport spokesman, 65 flights were canceled yesterday.
It is difficult to meet Lufthansa, which canceled almost 40 flights.The strike had no effect on the airports Zurich and Basel until the early afternoon.However, there is a large number of passengers who missed their flights to Switzerland because of the strike.

Homeland protection for Qantas leads to the mad / / Werner Enz · The Australian airline Qantante has been struggling with earnings problems for many years, but after a new half-year loss of the equivalent of $ 210 million, the nerves are now bare.
Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce, who is rarely relocated to a provocation, quickly named those who are supposed to be responsible for Qantas' financial problems.He accuses the Australian government that it has enabled foreign airlines that are controlled by the state, enabled the qantas competitor Virgin Australia to be started and granted them bilateral traffic rights.The Qantas boss continued to complain that the capacities in the international flight business have been expanded by direct Qantas competitors to all masses-namely around 46 % since 2009 with an expansion of global "only" 21 % in the same period.
It is undoubtedly the case that Qantas is attacked hard in the domestic business (by Virgin Australia) and on international routes.In the international flight business, which has been characterized by overcapacity and price war for decades, is nothing new.Loksmith is pointless, everyone has to see for themselves that they survive.
In addition, with cooperation with Emirates, Qantas went into a probably rapidly increasing dependence on a very potent direct competitor with the ruler Dubais in the background.In the coming months, Qantas will not be able to avoid drastic job cuts in the coming months.It is in the hands of the Australian government to say goodbye to antiquated ideas that link bilateral traffic rights with capital control.
It would be consistent to delete the still applicable equity clauses.Foreign shareholders are currently holding almost 40 % of Qantas shares;The edition applies that a maximum of 49 % may be kept.

Flight, train and generic / / The prices for generics and the fees at Zurich Airport employed the price monitor last year.In 2014 the focus is on an inexpensive service public. (SDA) /
For.Bern · In the dispute over the airport fees, price monitor Stefan Meierhans calls for an intervention by the Federal Council.
With the fees levied by airport users, Zurich Airport finances its operating and infrastructure costs.Negotiations on the future fees between the airlines and the airport ended without unsuccessfully last August.As a result, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation set the fees.
The Swiss criticized them as too high and submitted a complaint with the Federal Administrative Court together with other airlines.The price monitor also had previously described the fees that are passed on to the passengers.The regulation on the airport fees allows the airport to “increase the fees despite the record result and increase its profits at the expense of passengers”, Meierhans records in his 2013 annual report, which he presented on Friday.
"A revision of the regulation by the Federal Council is therefore clearly indicated," it says.The prices for generics are too high from the point of view of the price monitor.In the European comparison countries, these cost an average of 42 percent less than in Switzerland.
"The high prices are reflected in a low demand," said Meierhans in front of the media on Friday.The price monitor repeated the demand for a system change.The current remuneration system with a deductible is to be replaced by a fixed amount system.
If you receive expensive brands for medically not understandable reasons, you should have to shell out the surcharge compared to the cheapest generic yourself.According to Meierhans, this could save CHF 380 million annually.In the current year, Meierhans wants to focus on an “inexpensive service public”.
The public transport farms would have to do more to improve the utilization outside of the shock times.According to Meierhans, an idea would be to make the SBB Gleis 7 subscription available to everyone up to 25 years of new.The Association of Public Transport will make a fundamental decision in the current year and introduce new offers to the end of 2015, as its director Ueli Stückelberger said on request.

Ueli Maurers clearing out / / by Beni Gafner, Bern year the parliament decides which new weapons receive the relatives of the army.In recent years, however, not only the purchase of new aircraft or new tanks (longer) has ensured red heads.
In particular, the decommissioning of weapons systems increasingly ensured discussions and noise.When the army leadership, after the scrapping of the veteran assistant "M 113", also wanted to close the fortress plants in the Alps and Prealps and dismantle the mini throws hidden in them, the Nidwaldner CVP Councilor Walter Niederberger had enough.In a motion, he demanded that the mining launchers be rescued from the cutting burner.
In addition, the Federal Council should not only present a shopping list to Parliament in the armor programs, but also a list of those weapons that are to be taken out of service.Against the will of the Federal Council, both councils of this motion agreed in the course of 2012.And so it happens that the national and standing councils these days hold a “message about the procurement and the extra service of armoring material” for the first time.
Soon the Tigernda's armaments material will have to meet the requirements of the time to ensure the performance of the army, the Defense Department (VBS) writes.This also means that obsolete and surplus army material are liquidated or replaced by modern systems and equipment.Maurer called this yesterday in front of the media "clearing out".
From the 1970s, for example, one has nuclear and chemical protection material for 650000 men.According to Maurer, material that you bought in the time of the Cold War and that you no longer need in the long term should be "massively reduced".The most spectacular is probably the liquidation of the “F-5” fighter jet, Tiger, of which the patrol Suisse is also affected. ”The extra service of the Tiger Rest fleet should be completed by mid-2016,” the “Template B» statesof the arms program 2014. 110 of these tigers were purchased in 1975 and 1981.
Nine fell over the years, 44 were sold to the US Navy in 2002 as target objects.And three pieces should go into museum stocks as a “cultural asset”.The remaining 54 machines, together with the associated logistics and infrastructure, are now to be put out of service and sold if possible.
Between 2015 and 2020, 162 tank hooks “M 109” are also to be liquidated.581 of them used the army at the time of maximum fighting power.It is an artillery shooter on caterpillars that can shoot up to 20 kilometers.
In the future army, which is said to count 100,000 relatives, there are still four artillery departments.These are equipped with 96 combat value, that is, modernized armored hinges “M 109”.37 pieces should cover the training needs and serve as a reserve.96 Tanks
"Leo" liquidated with the new armaments program is also to be reduced by the inventory of tanks 87 "Leo".96 Leo with the configuration, as bought in the 1984 armaments program, are to be out of service between 2015 and 2020.
112 “Leo” increased value is still available to the four remaining tank battalions.22 «Leo» are added for the training.Maurer announced that the large evacuation campaign in the army is to be accompanied by a task force in the future.
The procurements are four positions that can be decided for a total of CHF 771 million.The purchase of new off -road vehicles is the highest amount in the program with CHF 440 million.3200 Mercedes-Benz G 300 CDI 4x4 (station car) vehicles are to be bought.
In a second tranche, another 600 to 800 particularly equipped vehicles will be added later.179 million are requested for a new bridge laying system.With this, obstacles up to 25 meters wide can be overcome.The new system, which is based on Panzer "Leo", is to replace the Panzer Bridge 68/88, which is well served.
The bridges are also suitable for natural disasters.The new equipment of data centers costs CHF 120 million.And finally, laser shot simulators are to be bought for CHF 32 million.

The stop is not excluded / / / Malaysia · Determine the disappearance of a Malaysian passenger plane in all directions.
This also includes accepting a terrorist attack.At least two passengers were on board under the wrong name.Dozens of ships and planes combed the South China Sea at the weekend.
Authorities checked the possibility of a terrorist attack.Radar notes indicated that the aircraft turned around 239 inmates shortly before the disappearance on Saturday, as investigators reported in Kuala Lumpur.The radar notes to reverse the machine surprised because the experienced pilot had not reported any problems on board before disappearing.
He also did not send an emergency signal.The contact with the Boeing 777 - 200, which was to fly from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, had broken off two hours after the start on Saturday morning.On board the machine, mostly Chinese travelers were.
The airline wanted to fly to Kuala Lumpur at the beginning of the week.False Identity Malaysia asked international help to clarify the identity of two passengers who were on board with stolen passes.Interpol therefore criticized the security controls of Malaysia Airlines.
The two passes stolen in Thailand were registered.The Malaysian Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein said the investigation was aimed at these two passengers.Surveillance cameras both had taken up.
The passes were stolen from an Italian and an Austrian in 2012 and 2013 in Thailand.The tickets in their names were acquired together, as the broadcaster CNN reported.According to a report by the “Los Angeles Times”, the US Federal Police FBI also intervened in the investigation.
In addition to the two obviously stolen passes, there were other disagreements.Minister Hussein spoke of information to a total of four suspects.As the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported yesterday, a passenger number on the Boeing 777 passenger list belonged to a resident of Fujian who did not leave the province.
Possible ruins of Malaysian military representatives said that 34 aircraft and 40 ships searched for traces in the southern China Sea, and Vietnamese search teams were added.Two oil films, the origin of which was checked, were found until the time of press.
Later it was said that off the Vietnamese coast, the remains of the machine may have been identified."Insmits of a Vietnamese aircraft have announced that they have discovered two debris," said a Vietnamese representative of the AFP news agency."They seem to come from an airplane," he added.
The site is located near the Vietnamese island of Tho Chu in the Gulf of Thailand.When this information became known, it was already night in the search area.Ships were ordered there.

The search for the flight MH370 continues / / Kuala Lumpur.The Malaysian military saw an airplane on its radar 45 minutes after the Malaysia Airlines machine disappeared.
The undetected aircraft was 370 kilometers northwest of the island of Penang above the Andaman Sea.That would be several hundred kilometers west of the Route of Flight MH370.The search was extended to this region yesterday.
An international search was started with satellites.The military radar is unable to identify the type and recognition of an aircraft, said Air Force Chief Rodzali Daud.Malaysia, however, asked the US authorities to help analyze the data, said Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein.
The air force manager had vehemently denied media reports about a signal west of Malaysia hours before his new unveiling.In the media reports there was talk of a signal in the street of Malakka.According to numerous contradictory information, the criticism of the authorities' crisis management grew in Malaysia.
The information about the missing plane is "quite chaotic," criticized the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.For the relatives of the 239 missing persons, the uncertainty becomes worse every day.Meanwhile, the young Kopilot was targeted by the investigators in Boeing 777 in the search for possible backgrounds for the disappearance.
Two tourists from South Africa reported to an Australian broadcaster that the 27-year-old brought them to the cockpit on a former flight and scored them around with them.The U.S. Air Travel Authority FAA is also said to have warned of “cracks and corrosion” for aircraft of the Boeing 777 family.Up to 120 aircraft registered in the USA could be affected by the weak point.

Malaysia's crisis management under fire / / five days after the mysterious disappearance of an aircraft of the Malaysia Airlines, the criticism of the authorities becomes louder.A coherent information policy is missing.
Marco Kauffmann Bossart, Singapurda's Vietnamese Ministry of Transport, announced on Wednesday that the search for the Boeing 777 will only be participated with full strength when the information requested by Malaysia is available.Since the disappearance of a passenger machine from the Malaysia Airlines, the Vietnamese have participated in the search in the Gulf of Thailand last Saturday, where the plane last set a signal 40 minutes after the start in Kuala Lumpur.Meanwhile, Malaysia has expanded the radius of the search to areas that deviate hundreds of kilometers from the flight route.
According to a report by the Chinese news agency Xinhua, pictures of rubble appeared late on Wednesday evening.According to the information, it is satellite images from the morning of March 9 from the sea area in front of the southern tip of Vietnam.They showed “three suspicious floating objects” of different sizes.
The largest piece of fair about 24 by 22 meters. «Chaotic information» The Malaysian Air Force Chief Rodzali Daud had declared on Monday that the plane had been recorded two hours after the start of a radar device of the military near the Malaysian island of Pulau, with which thePilot diametrically deviated from the flight route.A spokesman for Prime Minister Najib Razak accused the general untrue information.The latter claimed that he had been miscited and precisely specified that the military had discovered an airplane, but could not identify it.
The fact that the Andaman lake has also been combined with boats and spy aircraft since Wednesday suggests that there are only very vague ideas about the actual flight route of the missing machine.Aviatikers consider it possible that the transponder of the aircraft, which provides information about the position and the speed, was voluntarily switched off by the cockpit (in the case of a suicide) or under compulsion (in the event of a kidnapping) and the machine with the flight number MH 370until the suspected crash moved without civil surveillance.Although information panels and misunderstandings are part of every crisis of this extent, their sum leads to irritation.
It was initially said by the head of the civil aviation office, and five passengers checked had not started the trip to Beijing, the number of travelers was later reduced to four.Finally, the national police chief said that all booked passengers had taken their places.And while the International Police Authority of Interpol announced, two alleged asylum seekers who checked in with stolen passes in Kuala Lumpur, Dauha entered from Dauha with their correct Iranian passes in Malaysia, the authorities there spread a different version.
China's party -related newspaper “Global Times” estimated the Malaysian information policy as chaotic.A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that the Malaysian side had “repeated and inconsistent” to do everything to advance the investigation.The Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein stated that there was no confusion.
You follow every trace.Malaysia received backing from the United States.The director of the CIA, John Brennan, stated that the Malaysian side is doing everything they can to get on.
At the same time, Brennan spoke of a puzzle that was very worrying.Transport Minister Hussein emphasizes before the media that there is no confusion.Edgar SU /

Kidnapping possible / / Kuala Lumpur.Almost a week after her disappearance, there was still no trace of the Boeing 777 - 200 with 239 people on board yesterday.
After searching in the South China Sea, the main focus was on the Indian ocean hundreds of kilometers further west.The US military is also involved.According to insiders, the plane has been targeted towards the west.
Data from the Malaysian armed forces indicated this, said several people familiar with the investigation yesterday.You can see this as an indication that the Malaysia Airlines machine was still in the air after its disappearance from the radar screens and may have been kidnapped.Orientation to the path of paths reason for this theory provides the position of the aircraft after radio termination:
According to Reuters information, a machine over the Andaman Sea west of Malaysia appeared on radar umbrellas of the military.These points are used by transport aircraft on the way to the Middle East or to Europe.It is said to be flight MH370.
The knowledge of the markings can be closed on a trained aircraft leader or a correspondingly programmed autopilot.The investigation now focused on sabotage or kidnapping, said a high -ranking Malaysian police officer.The investigators would have received new information, said the Wissen House spokesman, Jay Carney.
He did not give details.The destroyer USS Kidd is now also looking for the plane in the Indian Ocean, according to the US military.Sda

Long flight theory receives update / / aircraft search · Almost a week after her disappearance, yesterday was still missing any trace of the Boeing 777 - 200 with 239 people on board.
Regardless of the Dementis from Malaysia, the “Wall Street Journal” presented new details about the supposedly much longer flight of the disappeared aircraft.Malaysian satellites are said to have received signals hours after the last position known by radar.The newspaper relies on investigators that are not mentioned by name.
The newspaper continues to write the signals (“pings”) that the machine was still intact hours after disappearing.The Malaysian Minister of Transport denied that they have received such signals.Insider: According to insiders, the west of Flogenda's west of Flogenda's plane has flown to the west.
Data from the Malaysian armed forces indicated this, said several people of the Reuters news agency familiar with the investigation.The insiders see this as an indication that the Malaysia Airlines machine was still in the air after its disappearance from the radar screens and may have been kidnapped.According to
Reuters information appeared between the Aviation Path stamps over the Andaman Sea west of Malaysia.These points are used by transport aircraft on the way to the Middle East or to Europe.New suspicion
The stay that the Boeing 777 was deliberately controlled into the area - either by a trained aircraft leader or a correspondingly programmed autopilot, it said.The investigation was now concentrated on sabotage or a kidnapping, said a high-ranking police officer from Malaysia. Yesterday the search flights continued: a Vietnamese soldier is looking for Malaysian-Airlines flight MH370.

Where did the last ping come from?/ / For a week from the Malaysian Airlines flight 370 there has been no trace.Because the Boeing 777 broadcast maintenance signals for hours, the search area is getting bigger.
And the information situation more chaotic.By Simone Schmid and Nicola Brusaeit the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines machine has passed more than a week.The paradox of the case: the more known about the disappearance of the aircraft, the less it is clear.
Instead of getting smaller, you expand it more and more.Or as a US military who is looking for the plane in the Indian Ocean, said: "It's a completely new game: We switch from a chess board to a football field." On March 8th at 0.41 a.m.A Boeing 777 - 200 at Kuala Lumpur Airport.
Charge 9m-Mro, 53 465 flight hours.The machine had been waited 12 days earlier and was supposed to land 55 minutes later in the Chinese capital Beijing.20 minutes after the start, the machine reaches a travel flight height of 35,000 feet, which is around 10,500 meters above ground.On board: 227 passengers and 12 crew members.
Another 21 minutes later, the machine is last recorded by a civil radar off the Vietnamese coast.Shortly before, the captain, an experienced man with more than 18,000 flight hours, reports to the Malaysian air traffic control: «Alright, Good Night.“It was his last radio message.
At 2.40 a.m., the Malaysian air traffic control MH 370 reports as missing.The search radius has been taking the machine for 7 days.It is unusual that such a large commercial aircraft disappears without a trace.
The rumors around MH 370 are correspondingly numerous. Has the plane been kidnapped?Shot down?Has the pilot committed suicide?
The latest thesis is: The Boeing flew up to 4000 kilometers from its last secured location - so it could have reached Australia, Pakistan or the island of Andaman.Various people are quoted in American media who are familiar with the case - Malaysia apparently asked the United States for help in evaluating flight data.According to US sources, broadcasters on the plane tried to send data to satellites for five hours.
These transmitters belong to the ACARS data radio system: the condition of the aircraft is continuously monitored today, and data packages with current measured values of petrol flow, turbine or exhaust gas temperature are regularly transmitted into the workshop via radio or satellites."Even if the data transmission in the cockpit is switched off manually, it is possible that acars will continue to try to establish a connection with the satellite and send so -called pings," says aviatic expert Matthias Schmid.
According to the US investigators, the last ping of the machine was discontinued five hours after disappearing - at normal flight altitude and over water.Based on this findings, the search area was extended to the west.In the meantime, twelve countries have sent ships and planes to the region, pictures of various satellites are used for evaluation.
At www.tomnod.com everyone is invited to take a closer look at these satellite images and to search for and mark oil traces, wreckage and rescue boats.Were women in the cockpit?In the last few days there have been evidence that indicated the crash of the machine: traces of oil that were later assigned to ships;
supposed debris on land and water;A rescue island that, on closer inspection, proved to be huge piece of garbage.The only safe realization: the sea is a garbage dump.
The rest dissolved in air.Accordingly, the media concentrate on aspects that only affect the flight in passing.The question arose whether the pilots were alone in the cockpit.
A young Australian had reported on a TV show that she was invited to the cockpit by the 27-year-old co-pilot on a former flight.There he smoked and talked to her instead of concentrating on flying.After disappearing, acquaintances wanted to have reached some of the passengers on the mobile phone.
The plane had landed in China, some said.The machine is in Vietnam, the others reported.Neither one nor the other was right.
Nor did anyone talk to one of the 239 people on board.The “Wall Street Journal” has traced the last hours of some passengers before departure: a group of Chinese artists Ace in front of boarding soup, fried shrimp and pork in a brown sauce.
The American businessman Philip Wood Simste from his girlfriend in Beijing from the machine that he would massage her back on her arrival.The couple prepared the move to Kuala Lumpur.The main thing is that the government of Malaysia has long since lost control of communication.
The coordination of the search for the plane would have ceded to the United States, it is said from US government groups.All too often, government and military spokesman contradict themselves, and all too often they had to deny information from their own ranks.Or as the US magazine "The New York" wrote: "It is difficult to say at what point the Malaysian authorities stopped communicating meaningful things.»
Malaysia was in the criticism of China, the country acted awkward and less cooperative that everything was "quite chaotic". Malaysian Airlines published 18 press releases until last night;Some of them deny government information and rumors.In number 17, the airline announces that the connection Kuala Lumpur-Peking is newly carried out as MH 318.

Cantonal Council for Aviation in Dübendorf / / In an extremely tight decision, SVP and FDP have laid out the further flight operations in Dübendorf in the guidelines.They fall in the back of the SVP government councilor Markus Kägi.
By Lorenzo Petròzurich - With the prickly decision by President Bruno Walliser (SVP), the cantonal council spoke out against the government council in the guideline debate yesterday afternoon when it comes to the airplace use of the Dübendorf airfield.This should not be excluded in the execution plan, SVP and FDP demanded in their short -term application.
Carmen Walker Späh (FDP, Zurich) wanted to have captured this in the execution plan after the weed of the government council for an innovation park on the airfield area at the beginning of the week. "Unshandatory, Feige, capitulation" to strengthen Dübendorf as a location for an innovation park in the intercantonal competitionWalker Späh found the government in the negotiation with the federal government.«There should be no sentence in the execution plan that excludes a coexistence of innovation park and flying use.»The FDP thus accommodated the SVP, which wanted to resume flying use in the execution plan anyway.
The government council, on the other hand, had only wanted to tolerate the Air Air Center and the cantonal police at the airfield in order not to deter potential investors for an innovation park.Stefan Feldmann (SP, Uster) called the application of the right.The FDP wants to "chose" for a decision.
Whether the canton of Zurich speaks for or against aviatic use has too much influence on the region - be it what concerns the expansion of the Glattalbahn, settlement development or even the innovation park - to leave this decision to the federal government.This has the last word in the matter.Without a clear statement in the direction of Bern, an expansion of the Kloten Airport in Dübendorf door, the door in Dübendorf, would be open with all its negative stress, according to the SP.
Robert Brunner (Greens, Steinmaur) called it a “Wischiwaschi decision”.In addition to flying operations, an “innovation core” no longer has a place.Die Linke could count on the support of the GLP, EVP and even the BDP, which had been on the bourgeois side in the short -term negotiations the evening before.
However, it had been convinced that it had to send a clear signal against aviatic use to the federal government."The application from FDP and SVP is a surrender," said Marcel Lenggenhager (Gossau).The government council should represent the attitude of the local communities, which did not want such use.
Great chances are forgiven, government councilor Markus Kägi (SVP) - in vain.SVP wants to maintain jobs SVP:
An airfield brings jobs and can also be operated economically with a few flight movements."Many small airfields in Switzerland prove this," said applicant Christian Lukec (SVP, Dänikon), who works at the Air Force at the Dübendorf airfield.A second Kloten is not possible anyway in Dübendorf, only because of the already sophisticated flight roads around the airport, said Silvia Steiner (CVP, Zurich). In the morning, the bike was in the morning - in contrast to the ailing tone in the further course of theDay - still conciliatory:
The bourgeois block that occurred throughout the week opened up something when it comes to the question of the bike routes.At the request of the SVP and FDP, the importance of bicycle and foot traffic was reduced compared to the other means of transport and only granted bicycle traffic at short distances.But when the SVP wanted to specify this and the bicycles were able to be useful for routes over five kilometers, the FDP no longer participated.
Perhaps because there are some fans of electrovelos in their ranks.That companion kept causing a conversation in the council during the traffic debate, be it as a danger to pedestrians, because one wanted to set up special, cross -free bicycles for them - which the bourgeoisies knew how to prevent - or because it was disputed within the green camp, whether it was argueddeals with these about a blessing or “atomic bike”, ie devil's stuff.No such was the idea of a parking garage on the barracks area with a connection to the city tunnel, found the rights shortly afterwards in the old manner and took them back into the execution plan.
The debate will continue on Monday in the cantonal council.For a far -sighted spatial politics this week, the overall review of the guideline was scheduled for the cantonal council.
The structure plan shows how the canton should develop and enables the government and the cantonal council to have a far -sighted spatial policy.Important chapters are settlement, landscape and traffic.His planning horizon is at least 25 years.

New huge search corridors / / aircraft search · The unexplained fate of the lost Malaysia Airlines passenger aircraft is becoming one of the most puzzling dramas in aviation history.
The two pilots of the Boeing 777 have been targeting new investigations at the weekend, whose apparently targeted course swivel and hours of crawling continue to raise many questions with an unknown goal.Since all communication systems on board have apparently been switched off manually, aircraft deflection or sabotage in the cockpit now appears more likely than before.The focus is on the crew and passengers, the Malaysian government said.
The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the Malaysia Airlines machine was controlled from the planned course to the northwest shortly after the start.Before that, two communication systems were deliberately dismissed "with a high probability".After the last radar contact, the Boeing 777 - 200 also flew for about seven hours.
Huge search area of the machine from 8.11 a.m. (local time) on March 8, said Najib Razak.Flight MH370 started at 0.41 a.m., he disappeared from the radar around 1.30 a.m.From the signal, the investigators conclude two huge possible corridors in which the machine could have been found when sending the last data.
A rich towards the northwest over Thailand, Burma, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, according to the Premier, the other towards the southwest over Indonesia in the southern Indian ocean.However, flight experts hardly believe that a Boeing 777 - 200 could fly over highly militarized zones such as the Indian -Pakistani border.Malaysia wants to support the Malaysian government for more support:
"Malaysia asks for help, including satellite data and analyzes, search teams, radar recordings as well as aircraft and ships," said it yesterday.The French Ministry of Transport announced that three experts from the flight accident investigation authority (BEA) will send.Bea experts were involved in the search for the Air France machine crashed in 2009 over the Atlantic, which was discovered after a long search on the seabed. The pilot's house in Malaysia has now been searched by the police.

The seats in the cockpit are no longer popular / / American airlines suffer from a lack of pilots.The lousy salaries are primarily to blame.
Now even the US government has turned on.By Kathrin Werner, New Yorkuniforms can be deceptive.Anyone who sees them with their dark blue suits, the shoulder flaps and the shiny buttons suspect.
But pilots in America often earn miserably - at least at the beginning of their career: According to the Air Line Pilots Association union, they come to just $ 22,400 in the first year, some earn only $ 15,000.This is just as much as the statutory minimum wage and not enough to pay off the training costs - more than $ 100,000.
The bad salaries, along with other factors, are now showing consequences: American airlines suffer from a bottleneck of pilots that will be dramatically tightened in the next few years.Even the US government has already switched on for the economy because of the importance of air traffic and created a study.
After this last year, eleven out of twelve regional airlines had greater difficulties in filling their vacancies.Republic Airways, one of the larger regional airlines, has already announced that it would be out of service for pilot deficiency 27 out of 243 aircraft.United Airlines strokes the majority of the flights to Cleveland in the state of Ohio, among other things because pilots are missing.
First, the bottleneck meets smaller airlines geared towards internal American traffic.Because they offer less money, fly smaller aircraft and only short distances, they are not so interesting for the pilots.The association of regional airlines warns less significant cities in the future if the industry does not find a solution.
The large airlines give you domestic flights, tickets are sold through the large providers such as Delta or United, but the aircraft and the crew provide the small companies.In the meantime, the approximately 70 regional providers take over half of all flights in America - often with very low profits.According to Flightpath Economics, the bottleneck threatens to destabilize the entire industry and to cause billions of bills.
The margins of the airlines are small.Several airlines have enforced violent cost savings programs through insolvency proceedings.In order to recruit pilots from abroad or keep their own workforce, many lack the money.
In the next 20 years, between 2000 and 4,500 new pilots would have to be hired each year, the US government estimates.The aircraft manufacturer Boeing predicts that 498,000 new pilots are needed worldwide in the period, including 85,700 in North America.«The global economy is growing and airlines will receive tens of thousands of new aircraft over the next 20 years.
The demand for people flying these planes will be unprecedented, »said the study.Also to blame is a combination of new requirements of the US government to the captains, a wave of retirement and emigration from pilots abroad.The parliament tightened the safety rules after a plane crash in 2009;
The new rules have just entered into force.In order to be admitted as the first officer, candidates must now demonstrate 1500 hours of flight experience, six times as much as before.In addition, pilots will have to take longer breaks per day.
So you need more captains for the same number of flights.In addition, many of the pilots are old.While 592 retired in 2012, it was already in 1367 last year.
According to estimates by the industry consultant Kit Darby, it should be 1519 this year.With the largest four airlines alone, 18,000 pilots reach retirement age by 2022 - at the same time the offspring are missing due to the poor salaries.In 2012, the FAA flight safety authority distributed only almost 55,000 new pilot student certificates, which was 31 percent less than 20 years ago.
Asia has the front also the immense demand for pilots in Asia hits the American airlines hard.Boeing expects almost 200,000 captains to be hired there over the next 20 years.The rapidly growing rivals, especially in China and in the Middle East, recruit more and more pilots from the USA.
They offer better salaries, lucrative entry bonuses and better career opportunities.According to the “Plane & Pilot” industry sheet, it takes only half as long as the threshold country airlines as in the USA to rise from the first officer to the captain - with double salary.And for people who jet around the globe anyway, the seat of their employer is not decisive.

Climate protectors offer flights to distant countries / / The Myclimate Foundation wants to make climate protection tangible on site.Your travel offers provoke criticism from environmentalists.
From Stefan Hänedie Ferien in Nepal, start with a flight from Zurich to Kathmandu, then the "short flight" follows Pokhara, and continues, among other things, "Per Jeep" through the "untouched nature" and back to Kathmandu.At the end of the 16-day tour, the flight to Switzerland follows.
This trip is offered by Globotrek and myclimate.The Zurich Foundation, founded in 2002 by ETH students, offers the opportunity to compensate for CO2 with climate protection measures in a different location according to his own promotion.Whether private individual, company or airline: everyone can reduce their CO2 footprint with compensation payments.
Myclimate invests the money in projects in which fossil burning and fuel are replaced by renewable energies.Myclimate sees this as an effective CO2 reduction.Critics, on the other hand, doubt the benefits of the projects and speak of an indulgence trade that only serves to calm down the guilty conscience.
Companies and people could keep their climate -damaging behavior with reference to the supposed climate neutrality. "Myclimate is disavowing" By promoting Myclimate itself for air travel, the foundation now provides the critics: too much is already being flown, says BernhardPiller from the Swiss Energy Foundation (SES).
«Myclimate disavowes itself when she fueled this development.“If you take mobility policy in air traffic, you should critically question travel and its meaning, says the Green Stadtzürcher municipal council.WWF Switzerland is cautious: Switzerland:
You don't know the travel offer from MyClimate and the considerations behind it.In principle, the WWF Switzerland recommends holiday destinations that can be reached by train or bus.«Because flying is extremely climate -damaging.»
The flight to Kathmandu, for example, causes a CO2 emissions of 2.5 tons per capita - this corresponds to car driving in about a year.The compensation costs CHF 227 at MyClimate if the emissions are reduced in Swiss climate protection projects, the remaining proportion in developing and emerging countries.If the compensation takes place exclusively in international projects, it becomes significantly cheaper with CHF 73.
The Nepal trip costs CHF 4,650.The Myclimate Foundation advertises on its website for two more trips - to Bolivia and East Africa.The difference to ordinary tours also makes the myclimate visiting the climate protection projects.
In Nepal, for example, tourists get to know a village that benefits from the installed biogas plants.This means that according to myclimate: Because people need less wood to fire, not only reduces the smoke load in their houses, but also the deforestation of the forests decreases, which in turn benefits the tigers.In this combination, myclimate managing director René Estermann sees the benefit of the offer:
The meaning and effect of the projects can be experienced in direct contact with people "natural, very impressive and sustainable"."Problems and opportunities that are otherwise difficult to grasp are obvious." Estermann denies that Myclimate promotes air traffic: "These trips address travelers who are planning a long -distance trip anyway.»It is much more important for climate protection that many more air travelers would contribute to such climate protection projects.
Despite constant growth, there are only a few per thousand of travelers who would do CO2 compensation.As the reason for this, Estermann mentions the complicated payment system.In his opinion, airlines and tour operators should therefore integrate CO2 compensation more easily into their travel products.
Federal Councilor Leuthard Schweigtdiese explanation does not convince the critics.They refer to the self -promotion of the foundation, which speaks of the compensation of "inevitable emissions".
Such trips are ultimately pure pleasure.According to SES expert Piller, symptomatic for the development of MyClimate states that the foundation had said goodbye to the core group of the climate alliance at the end of the year.Representatives of this network of environmental protection associations meet regularly to discuss environmental or energy policy issues and to determine positions.
Managing Director Estermann replies that numerous organizations on the political parquet would already lobby for climate protection.Myclimate is also involved - "just not so striking". Myclimate not only has critics, but also enjoys support from the highest point.For example, Environment Minister Doris Leuthard (CVP) is sitting in the patronage committee.
Upon request, the Federal Councilor has it not to be assessed by the foundation's operational activities at the committee members.The federal government is also represented on the board of trustees - with Marcel Zuckschwerdt.The Vice Director of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation advertises on the Myclimate website with the sentence: «CO2 emissions: do without unnecessary dispensing and compensate for inevitable.»
Zuckschwerdt also does not comment on myclimate.One plane lands (above), one starts: Zurich Airport, 2012. Photo: Keystonemyclimate13 million francs
Sales of the Myclimate Foundation based in Zurich is one of around 300 organizations worldwide in the market of voluntary CO2 compensations.It is mainly financed by orders and donations from private and public sector.Educational projects for schools and apprentices are supported by the federal government.
The Federal Office of Energy and the Federal Office for the Environment have spent around CHF 200,000 for this in recent years.The foundation employs 55 employees in Zurich and looks after 70 climate protection projects worldwide.In 2012 she took around CHF 13 million.
Since its foundation in 2002, she has sold over 2.6 million tons of CO2 compensations.For comparison: In Switzerland, CO2 escapes a year for 40 million tons of CO2.(STH)

Without the pilots it was not possible / / after evaluating further data it is clear: the pilots must have been involved in the disappearance of the flight MH370.
Whether voluntarily or not, that remains open.The investigators now continue to examine their lives.By Arne Perras, Singapurder Malaysische Premier Najib Razak stayed in the background for a whole week.
But now that the investigation gains a little more in the substance, he speaks himself: The data seems to confirm the thesis that the cause of the disappearance was not technical failure.Rather, almost everything now indicates that people are responsible for the disappearance of the MH370 flight.
He said that on Saturday.And: The Malaysian passenger plane with 239 passengers on board, who had been lost for over a week, has changed its course in a targeted manner.Someone who knew how to change the course must have made the course change and did everything to ensure that the machine was no longer to be followed.
Pilot and co-pilot must somehow be involved in the campaign, whether voluntarily or not.This is the hypothesis that was decisive this weekend.Where exactly the Boeing 777 - 200 came from the course is interesting: As American media report, the machine disappeared just in the place where the aircraft left the Malaysian air safety room and should have arrived in the Vietnamese surveillance area.
Flight MH370 reported to the Malaysian air traffic control.Around the same time, one hour after the start, the transponder was also switched off, the incoming signals were automatically answered.And the ACARS data radio system, which permanently sends data from various flight systems to the ground for control, was no longer in operation.
This was confirmed by Hishammuddin Hussein, the Malaysian Minister of Transport, at a media conference yesterday and added that Acars hadn't worked more than a voice "all clear, good night" - the last radio message before the machine disappeared.If you belonged to the voice, it is not clear.So the authorities are now focusing on finding possible kidnappers, saboteurs, suicide or terrorists.
Who had a motif to deliberately redirect the machine and why?The investigators have been particularly interested in the pilot and the co-pilots since the weekend.According to reports from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian police searched the apartments of the two on Saturday afternoon.
So far, nothing suspicious has been discovered in the vita of the 53-year-old captain.Zaharie Ahmad Shah is an experienced pilot with more than 18,000 flight hours and three decades in the cockpit.Colleagues describe him as "professional and committed", his acquaintances draw the image of a friendly and cheerful man who likes to go among people and also liked children.
Friends of the pilot do not believe that Shah may have committed suicide or that in any other form could have something to do with the disappearance."His character does not interpret in this direction," says one of his friends.The pilot, an enthusiasm that comes from Penang, was apparently a real flight enthusiast, which is why he even installed a flight simulator at home, which he used in his free hours.
Some wonder why someone who already sits so much on the plane is also turning his job into a hobby.You are surprised, but Shah doesn't make that suspicious.Nevertheless, the Malaysian police have now taken the device with it and wants to further investigate it.
To the co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid (28), they are rather extravagant.Supposedly, he is said to have allowed two young South Africans access to the cockpit and also smoked there.So was it a kidnapping?
Premier Najib Razak does not want to go that far with his assessment.«We still examine all the options.»The new findings are based on evaluations of radar and satellite data by various experts, as Razak explains.
«With a high level of certainty, we can say that the ACARS communication system was deactivated before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia.»According to his words, a comparison of all available radar and satellite information must now be understood that the Boeing is reversed and initially flogged the Malaysian peninsula in a west direction before it is swiveled to the northwest."Unfortunately, due to the data, it is not possible to confirm the last position of the machine," says the premier.
Rather, two corridors have named in the southern Razak, in which the plane is said to have moved.He also relies on satellite data.One of the corridors runs from Nordthailand to the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
The other runs south of Indonesia in the southern Indian Ocean.It seems more likely among specialists that the Boeing moved on the South corridor.In the north, she would have flowned countries that have strong civilian and military radar systems.
A Boeing 777 - 200 is not simply undetected.The search should now be even more complicated, Malaysia has contacted 25 countries to get further radar data and help with the investigation.So far, 58 aircraft and 43 ships from numerous countries from the region have been traveling at sea to track down debris.
The United States also participates with a destroyer and an air reconnaissance.But nobody has discovered a single piece yet.Zaharie A. Shah.

An innovation park with a runway for bankers / / the bourgeois would like an innovation park with a university for finance and banking.This decision was almost as short on Monday as on Friday that it was to start and land civil aircraft in Dübendorf in the future.
· The innovation park employed the cantonal council again on Monday.This time not in connection with the Dübendorf airfield, but in the chapter “Public Constructions and Plants” of the guideline.
With 84 against 82 votes, the Council accepted a minority request from the FDP.According to this, the parliament should also examine the establishment of an International University Center for Financial and Bank Sciences in the event of creating an innovation park.The structure plan is the wrong place to prefer individual industries, Thomas Wirth (GLP., Hombrechtikon) countered.
Two topics would be mixed here, Mattea Meyer (Sp., Winterthur).He wondered the support of the application by the SVP, it was ironic (Gp., Zurich): So more German professors would come to Switzerland.
If banks speak of innovative products, distrust was appropriate, Markus Schaaf (Evp., Zell). For Hans-Peter Portmann (FDP., Thalwil) it is about an educational concern: The canton of Zurich must focus on where it strengthenshave .
In view of the international developments, the financial sector urgently needs future opportunities.Building director Markus Kägi in vain warned of already linking the innovation park with content.A week ago, the government and universities had promoted the idea without determining.
The park itself now finds twice in the execution plan.In addition to a public investment, also in the Chapter of Transport, after a stalemate on Friday and the President of the Council: there, however, associated with the statement that the further aviatic use of the airfield, which the government council rejects, is the responsibility of the federal government (see additional text).Previously, the Council advised the chapter and disposal, which was only revised in 2009.As on the subject of traffic, he rejected applications from the left-green side or, on the proposal of the bourgeois, replaced the version of the Commission with the earlier version of the government council.
In particular, it was rejected to remove two gravel mining areas near Glattfelden and a landfill location in Horgen and Rüti from the execution plan.In the future, at least 35 percent of brooded material will have to be removed by train.The canton wants to create a legal basis for this.
The last chapter of public buildings and facilities was developed from scratch.The traffic debate flared up again, whereby applications were rejected for better development of these facilities with public transport and for cyclists.The decentralization of the cantonal schools with new locations at the lake shores and in the Knonau office was undisputed.
The structure plan debate will end on Tuesday.A concrete slope, but not on paper stefan Hotz (sho) sho.· «The canton is committed to the federal government for a task of aviating use at the airfield area Dübendorf.»
On Friday, the cantonal council stroked this sentence against the will of the government.The applications submitted at short notice have led to a misunderstanding in the reporting of the NZZ.It is not true that the slopes canceled by the government council are re -entered on the map.
The structure plan consists of text and map.Under the keyword “card entries”, the Dübendorf Council included in the list of airfields - in the text section.For the other airfields, the length of the slopes and its alignment are given.
In Dübendorf, however, it is said that the subject of the subject planning according to federal legislation.This means that the slope remains from the directional plank card, although it is available as a 2500 meter long band between Dübendorf and Volketswil.In this respect, little changes in the matter when the federal government as the owner decides on the future of the airfield.
However, it can only build if the area is available for the area, mostly agricultural area.As a rule, the canton and the location communities are responsible for this, but the federal government and the military are responsible for aviating.Politically, on the other hand, the cantonal council stated that the innovation park and any use of the slopes should not be played against each other.

Now the NASA is switching on / / aircraft search · The search for the lost machine of the flight MH370 is moving more and more circles.
After China's sharp criticism, Malaysia brought new experts to the investigation.A specialist from China and three experts from France joined the team of investigators, Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein said yesterday in Kuala Lumpur.At the same time, there was an intensive new search along the two routes on which the machine could have flown on board with 239 people.
26 countries are now involved in the search.There were no new findings on the whereabouts of the Boeing 777 - 200 disappeared on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang personally put pressure on his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak, as the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.
LI demanded that the investigators would have to provide more extensive details and reliable data.There were more than 150 Chinese among the passengers.Kopilot spoke last
Words Last contact with the machine came to light a new detail: The last known words from the cockpit probably came from co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid and not from flight captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, said airlining chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.The last radio message - "All right, good night" - went in at 1.19 a.m. local time, about forty minutes after the start and twelve minutes after the Acars communication system was switched off manually.
Malaysia's Minister of Transport said that, in addition to sabotage and kidnapping, a possible suicide of a pilot would also be considered.US intelligence agencies also concentrate on the pilots.This was confirmed by the chairman of the Committee for Internal Security in the US House of Representatives, Michael McCaul.
In addition, the head of the US room trip authority NASA, Charles Bolden, ordered that all the possibilities of NASA to contribute to search should be checked, as a spokesman said.Accordingly, pictures are currently evaluated by satellites and the international space station (ISS).Objects that are larger than thirty meters could be identified on it.

2014
Much remains unclear / / Why did not report a passenger by cell phone?Why did an emergency call ever come?
Was it a technical breakdown and not sabotage?The investigators are working these questions.Walter Jäggida's aircraft is as big as a block of flats: 64 meters long and 19 meters high, and it has a wingspan of 60 meters.
But the disappeared Boeing 777 of the Malaysia Airlines was not spotted yesterday Monday.Apart from the speculation about a kidnapping, the question arises as to how an aircraft can disappear in such a way in the international air traffic network.The fact that communication systems were switched off on board can be an indication of criminal action.
But does not have to: it happens that devices or systems play crazy on the plane, show an incorrect alarm or simply "error".In such cases, they are sometimes switched off in a targeted manner.It has also happened that a transport aircraft has taken a completely wrong route because the autopilot was wrongly programmed.
The cause was punishable negligence.Other planes have already flown uncontrollably until the fuel tanks were empty.They then crashed because the crew was no longer able to act.
And quite a few machines have been lost over the sea without ever finding out what they had grown.There are indications that flight MH370 was deliberately sent to his straw.The famous chain of unfortunate circumstances, which is held responsible for accidents, cannot be excluded.
Even over a week after the aircraft disappeared, there are still open questions.One of them: Why didn't the passengers register when the machine deviated from the course?In the middle of the night over the sea it is hardly possible for lay people to notice a change of course.
Communication with the cell phone would only be possible in the catchment area of a Telecom fixed antenna, but not over the sea.It is not known whether the satellite phones existing in the business class were used.The radar is limited by the transponder of the B777 out of operation, the plane did not make the plane entirely invisible.
The transponder is automatically called up by the floor station and delivers data from the cockpit to air traffic control - information about the aircraft, the flight altitude or speed.The air traffic controller can identify any machine on the screen.However, there are no feedback on the so -called primary radar;
The radar rays are only reflected from the aircraft - only one light point appears on the screen.This means that machines can also be discovered without - or with off - but not identified.Primary radar is used by military airspace monitoring.
The range of the radar is limited, a complete radar cover of the oceans is not possible.For the purposes of the military and research, the major powers operate the so -called over -the -counter cycle, which extends several thousand kilometers.Australia has such a system whether it can help with the search for MH370 is questionable.
In the absence of radar, air traffic control over the oceans uses the data that the aircraft delivered to you.These are transmitted via satellites, but communication devices on board must be switched on.Why no emergency call station?
In the case of MH370, it remains puzzling why no automatic emergency sender has registered.In the event of a crash or in the event of an emergency water, the devices that must be present in every large aircraft send their position to an emergency call center via a satellite system.From there, the rescue campaigns are triggered.
The system has been in operation for 35 years and has reported 10,000 accidents;It is considered reliable.However, such an emergency buoy can also be switched off - or, for example, due to a poor battery.
Did MH370 secretly land somewhere?This is conceivable, abandoned slopes for a long time have been abandoned.And if you don't want to start again, you can also land on a dilapidated slopes with a B777.
They don't reveal whether the secret services would notice that.In order to find a wreck in a few thousand meters, this is probably necessary for this.The routine monitoring of the surface of the sea through observation satellites is also the most likely a business of the secret services.

Search area for MH370 has the size of Australia / / / Kuala Lumpur.The search area is now huge eleven days after the puzzling disappearance of the Malaysian aircraft with the flight number MH370.
The Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein spoke yesterday of a total area of 7.68 million square kilometers, which corresponds approximately to the area of Australia.Malaysia revoked a central point of previous information yesterday.It is therefore unclear when the Boeing communication system was switched off.
The exact time could not be determined, said the Minister of Transport.According to a report by the “New York Times”, the first course change of the machine with 239 people on board is said to have been entered in a aircraft computer system.The change of direction was very likely to program someone in the cockpit, wrote the newspaper, citing rank-high US government agents.
Hunger strike between the relatives between 26 countries are looking for the Boeing.Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have no evidence that the aircraft could have penetrated its airspace, reported the State Chinese news agency Xinhua.Pakistan and India also know nothing about the machine.
Angry relatives of Chinese passengers threatened hunger strike if they no longer get any information."We don't want to be a victim of politics," said a relative yesterday about the press.At a meeting with representatives of the airline in Beijing, they expressed sharp criticism of previous information policy.
In the search, Malaysia included additional experts.The US room trip authority NASA evaluates pictures taken by satellites and the international space station ISS.Objects that are larger than 30 meters could be identified on it, a spokesman said.
Sight over the Maldives?Shortly after the MH370 flight disappeared, the residents of a Maldives island apparently observed a deep-flying passenger jet.According to eyewitnesses, the plane was white with red stripes - so the Malaysia Airlines planes often look like, the newspaper “Haveeru” reported online yesterday.
According to the corresponding reports, the aircraft crossed the island at 6.15 a.m. local time and made a deafening noise.«I have never seen an aircraft so low over our island.We saw aircraft, but I am sure that it wasn't one, »said an eyewitness to the newspaper.
Meanwhile, a new theory is circulating on online platforms, which means that the missing aircraft in the slipstream of another Boeing could have flown to India or Afghanistan.Hidden behind another machine, the MH370 would not have been visible to the radar and could have covered long distances.Sda

Flew the Boeing over the Maldives?/ / The Malaysian machine from flight MH 370 has disappeared for eleven days.The search area is now as big as Australia.
Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein called an area of 7.68 million square kilometers yesterday.Also yesterday Malaysia revealed previous information about when the Boeing communication system was switched off.The exact time could not be determined, said the Minister of Transport.
The course change of the machine with 239 people on board was entered in the aircraft computer system according to a report by the “New York Times”.It was very likely that someone in the cockpit did it.Shortly after the aircraft disappeared, residents of a Maldives island observed a deeply flying passenger jet.
According to eyewitnesses, the aircraft was white and showed red stripes, reports the newspaper “Haveeru” online.The passenger machine crossed the island at 6.15 a.m. local time and made a deafening noise."I have never seen an airplane so low over our island," said an eyewitness.

MH370: Who entered the course change?/ / Kuala Lumpurelf days after the puzzling disappearance of the Malaysian aircraft MH370 it is unclear who entered the course change of the machine.
According to a report by the “New York Times”, the first course change of the machine with 239 people on board is said to have been entered in a aircraft computer system.The change of direction was very likely to program someone in the cockpit, wrote the newspaper, citing rank-high US government agents.Instead of controlling the machine manually, the direction of flight over seven or eight keyboard attacks was entered in a computer between the captain and the first officer, it said.
Malaysia also revoked previous information yesterday in a central point.It is therefore unclear when the Boeing communication system was switched off.The exact time could not be determined, said Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein.
He contradicted earlier statements that the ACARS communication system had been switched off from the cockpit before the last literal feedback.According to Hussein, it has no influence on the search that the communication before or after the last radio message was switched off at 1.19 a.m.About the Maldives?
In the meantime, 26 countries are looking for the Boeing.The search area is as large as the area of Australia.Malaysias Minister of Transport called a total area of 7.68 million square kilometers yesterday.
Shortly after the MH370 flight disappeared, the inhabitants of a Maldive island apparently observed a deeply flying passenger jet.According to eyewitnesses, the aircraft was white with red stripes - the aircraft of the Malaysia Airlines often looked like, the newspaper “Haveeru” reported online yesterday.According to the corresponding reports, the aircraft crossed the island at 6.15 a.m. and made a deafening noise.
"I have never seen an airplane so low over our island," said an eyewitness to the newspaper.Angry relatives of the approximately 150 Chinese passengers threatened with hunger strike in the event that they no longer get any information.

"Prevent new procurement debacle" / / costs of CHF 10 billion.Various questions about the Gripen vote were clarified in the article.
However, what was not addressed at all are the immense costs, which would come to Switzerland by buying 22 new fighter jets.The CHF 3.1 billion mentioned in the article only contain the purchase price of the new planes.However, this is by no means everything.
In addition, there are maintenance and operating costs of CHF 3.5 billion and retrofitting of around CHF 3 billion.If you add the intermediate rent, investments in real estate and the procurement project, you will get a total amount of over CHF 10 billion in taxpayers.This is too much money for a purchase that Switzerland does not need at all.
In the case of a yes to the Gripen Fund Act on May 18, Switzerland would make a big mistake from a financial policy.You can't spend a franc twice - the CHF 10 billion would be missing in many other places.The savings, AHV and public security are already being saved in education, AHV.
Two thirds of all cantons and many communities issue savings packages.CHF 10 billion could enable great new research projects at universities.For me it is unsustainable to spend CHF 10 billion for fighter jets instead of investing this money in actual security through education and health.
Sarah Stieger, Zurich -racing minimal variant.The graphic "So big are European air weapons" is blatant.
54 ancient Tiger aircraft are added to the modern 32 f / a-18.This results in a relatively impressive total number.The fact is: No European country still has this type of aircraft.
Norway retired his 108 tiger 14 years ago.Who of the left army exhausters still has an Apple I-Computer with 4 KB RAM?
They were manufactured when the Swiss Air Force procured the tiger.Computer users have completely replaced their devices 7 times since 1978, because at some point it will be overwhelmed with the pussy.After 35 years, an aircraft can no longer be operated sensibly.
In addition: The populated significantly smaller countries Denmark and Norway procure the luxury high-tech model F-35, the unit price of which is twice as high as that of the grip.Both air force took part in the Afghanistan and Kosovokrieg.Both air weapons have large transport aircraft, Switzerland not a single one.
Conclusion: The procurement of the 22 gripes is the reasonable minimal variant, unless we believe that a stranger should take over the protection of our airspace.From a neutrality policy perspective, because of the current troubles with the EU and because we are not a NATO member, Russia would be offered.Roland Popert, Ossingen -Stunigen monster project.
We don't have to buy gripes to play the military.We truly have enough other projects that we have to finance more urgent.You can't constantly talk about saving and then finance such ridiculous monster projects.
These aircraft are unnecessary, too expensive, and not even developed.We would throw billions out to the window.Peter Hirzel, Altdorf too many fighter jets for Switzerland.
The graphic of the article shows how many fighter jets have different countries in Europe.For example, the Czech Republic, which is somewhat greater than Switzerland, has only 14 fighter jets as a NATO state.What does a neutral country like Switzerland want with so many fighter jets?
The fighter jets are expensive and their purchase leads to savings in other areas.This would be affected by education, public transport, hospitals, social security and agriculture.In addition, these gripes produce a lot of noise.
In addition, the gripes consume a large amount of petroleum and pour out a huge load of CO2.And all for nothing and nothing again.Michael Philipp Hofer, Winterthurnicht finance over the budget.
The article mentions that bourgeois politicians want to finance the procurement of gripes through the ordinary budget in the event of a no.This makes no sense for two reasons.On the one hand, they would go back to the people who said no beforehand.
On the other hand, even the army chief André Blattmann said two years ago to the newspaper “Southeastern Switzerland” that the F / A-18 will still fly by 2035 and 2040 and thus ensure Switzerland's security in peace.Ueli Maurer, on the other hand, apparently doubts the army chief's statements if he claims that the F / A-18 would not be sufficient to ensure security.Also in the 2010 army report adopted by the Federal Council it says that the F / A-18 is sufficient for the air policial service and there is therefore no reason to buy even a single grip with our tax money.
Since each franc can only be output once, savings will be made in other areas.Do we really want this?Marco Baumgartner, Kaiseraugstehren from the Mirage scandal.
During the Swiss Air Force tests, the grip not only cut off less than the other aircraft offered.The grip in all areas examined, especially in the air police and in air defense, has cut off less than today's F / A -18 of the army - and even after the Air Force coincides with all the improvements promised by Saab that only exist on paper.It seems that all teachings from the Mirage scandal have been forgotten.
The military department wants to spend more than CHF 10 billion for aircraft and follow -up costs, although the analysis of the Air Force showed that the technical risk of griping is very great.Fortunately, it is now in the hands of the voters to prevent a new procurement debacle.Tobias Estermann, betting people will earn a lot.
The gripen would cost us around 10 billion in taxpayers if the people agreed to buy.Not only would the procurement be devoured billions, the maintenance and the expected retrofits will also make up ten -digit amounts.To illustrate: If you had this money paid out in tens notes, you could heat an average single -family house for several years by burning the banknotes.
Nobody can explain for which specific scenarios the additional combat aircraft would need.But it can be assumed that some would earn a golden nose on the gripen.Andreas Weibel, Winterthur «

The first hot lane / / flight MH370DAS missing aircraft may have fallen into the Indian Ocean 2500 kilometers southwest of the Australian Perth.
The sighting of possible wreckage of the lost Malaysia Boing in the Indian Ocean gives hope to clarify the case."New and credible information came to light," said Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott in Canberra yesterday.Two objects were discovered on satellite images, which could possibly be fragments of the Boeing 777 - 200 that had disappeared almost two weeks ago.
Enlightenment aircraft are in use, but bad weather disabled the view yesterday.Ships were also sent to the far remote sea area.The region is located about 2500 kilometers southwest of Perth on the Australian west coast.
One of the identified pieces is about 24 meters long, the second 5 meters, said John Young, emergency aid manager of the AMSA sea security authority, in front of the media in the Australian capital Canberra.“It looked like they rocked up and down on the water.»A form, such as that of a wing, cannot be seen.
Both Abbott and Young emphasized that the objects had not been identified as wreckage parts.The AMSA immediately sent four aircraft.These can only search for two hours before you have to reverse to be able to reach the output base at Perth with the fuel.
On the suspected Routeda's area lies approximately along the flight route, which the machine might have taken on board with 239 people, said Young.He estimated that the sea in the area is more than 1000 meters deep.The Malaysian Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein spoke in Kuala Lumpur of the "most important trace so far".
Now it's about hardening it.The Chinese government pursues the search with "great attention"."We offer Australia our help," said the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, Hong Lei, according to a message.
More than 150 of the 239 inmates of the lost aircraft are Chinese.Since the machine disappeared, there had been several reports about supposed aircraft fragments, such as in the southern China Sea.So far, this has turned out to be a false alarm.
The recent pictures came from commercial satellites, said Commodore John McGarry from the Australian military.Secret services had evaluated the pictures.According to signal and data analyzes, the investigators have now been convinced that the machine moved radically from the course and continued for hours.could.

Zurich Airport shines / / "Zurich AG Airport AG has its shareholders participate with a higher dividend in the severely increased net profit in the past financial year.
The data wreath presented on Thursday at the balance sheet media conference shows a Zurich AG Airport, which is in a dazzling constitution.In 2013, income from the 2013 flight business - from only 0.3 % to 24.9 million passengers - could be increased.In relation to the financial status, the passenger and security fees, the separately guided aircraft noise balance sheet increased by 1.5 % to CHF 365.1 million.
Since declining flight movements were registered, the landing and emission fees dropped, albeit slightly.In 2013, 262 227 flight movements were registered, which is 2.9 % less than in the previous year.Additional yields bumped in the previous year, the sales of non-aviation expanded above average.
Retail's yields and Duty Free grew by 5.7 % to CHF 92.4 million.Thanks to the improved traffic closure, sales stores at the airport have also become more attractive for customers who do not necessarily get on an airplane or are on the way back from abroad.
It should also be mentioned that the revenue from the noise fees, including noise-dependent landing fees and surcharges for night border hours, are now going into big money.In 2013, they increased by a further 4.4 % to CHF 54.4 million.However, the “noise fifth” has been sisted since the beginning of February because the cash register has now been plentiful for compensations.
Recording of a borrowing of the airport has improved a lot, since the EBIT margin increased from 18.1 % to 31.0 %.However, this should be relativized because special effects shaped the two years strongly.The airport leadership states that operational performance was increased by 5.8 % without special effects.
In 2012, a special effort of CHF 121 million was due for the pension fund (follow -up contract with the BVK).And in 2013, a large -scale restructuring of financial liabilities with a plus of CHF 77.5 million.Yen-private placings were replaced by a 1.5 % interest of Franconia bond.
Relief effects from this will be noticeable in the coming years.In any case, the interest -bearing debt is no longer a real mortgage.Investments of CHF 237 million in 2013 faced an operational cash flow of CHF 459 million.

Airport lobby wants to disempower Zürcher cantonal council / / slopes extensions in the future.This requires an initiative.
From Pascal Unternährer and Liliane Minordas Zürcher Cantonal parliament at the request of left-green green, the extension of the western slope 28 and the north slopes 32 at Zurich Airport deleted the direction of the direction.A majority came about because 14 bourgeois politicians from the airport region have fraternized with the left.
The Zurich parliament thus challenges the federal government, which lists the slopes extensions in its infrastructure of the aviation (SIL).According to the federal government and airport, the aircraft noise state contract with Germany can only be implemented if all planes can land from the east in any weather.Today, the slope is too short for large space pilots in unfavorable conditions.
The critics of the decision now rely on the Federal Council, which has to approve the Zurich structure plan.The Federal Office of Civil Aviation considers the slopes extensions to be unavoidable, and Transport Minister Doris Leuthard shares this opinion.Because the interests of the federal government and the canton of Zurich diverge, there will be an unification process.
If the parties do not agree, the Federal Council decides in the last instance.If the Airport Act is still changing the slopes extensions into the execution plan, but they are far from being a reality.According to the Airport Act, the cantonal council decides on extensions at the airport.
And as yesterday's decision has shown, there is currently no majority for longer slopes.Circles close to the airport are now starting there.With a popular initiative, they want to undermine the parliament and change the airport law so that the people have the last word.
"The cantonal council should not be able to prevent slopes alone," explains Regine Sauter, FDP cantonal councilor and director of the Zurich Chamber of Commerce.Behind the initiative are business associations and the airport lobby."We welcome the popular initiative," says airport spokeswoman Sonja Zöchling.
"Without the slope extensions, we cannot implement the state contract without capacity." However, the airport will not participate in the committee.Despite the cantonal council decision, the airport continues the long -started planning of the slopes extensions."Time is pushing," says Zöchling.
If Germany ratifies the state treaty like the National and Council of States, it must be implemented by 2020.The application for extended slopes is ready in a year, announces the airport spokeswoman.Comment page 2, reports page

Satellite data is questioned / / The British satellite operator Inmarsat has calculated the approximate crash location of MH 370.In China, however, official bodies are also more tangible, so far there are no findings of ruins.
Boeing 777 The Malaysian Airlines was missing by Pia Wertheimerdie must have fallen into the Indian Ocean on March 8th between 0.11 and 1.15 a.m.The Malaysian Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein assumes this, as he said in front of the media on Tuesday.The machine with 239 people on board flew seven and a half and eight and a half hours after the start in Kuala Lumpur - as long as the fuel was enough.
The high-resolution camera of the American satellite WorldView-2, which circles at an altitude of 756 kilometers, discovered possible debris on March 16.The Australian authorities only publicized this last Thursday.Experts have now raised the question of whether it was not just a light reflection.
Digital Globe, the owner of the satellite, explains the duration of the investigations with the amount of data that there were.According to their own information, their five satellites send pictures of 2.9 million square kilometers every day, including Google.Inmarsat's last contact shon three hours after the Boeing 777 disappeared from the radars of the pilots, employees of the British communications company Inmarsat searched for the machine.
They did this about one of their telecommunications satellites.This registered hour contact signals from the Boeing via their automatic satellite communication system.On the one hand, the British engineers found that the aircraft station was still working.
On the other hand, due to the angle of incidence, it could be closed from which direction the last signal came.The analysis resulted in two possible corridors.Now the British communication company has succeeded in creating a new arithmetic model that limits the whereabouts of the Boeing.
The experts assume that she has not moved in the northern, but in the southern corridor.As Chris McLaughlin from Inmarsat said in an interview at the BBC, the experts compared the signal data from other Boeing 777 by Malaysian Airlines with those of the lost machine.After an exclusion process, they then concluded where the machine in the Indian Ocean last set a signal.
"We were dealing with a completely new area here," says McLaughlin.Inmarsat tried for the first time with a single signal per hour and without GPS data or information about time and distance to locate an aircraft.«It was a shot in the blue.»
A very precise location was not possible with the method.Skepticism in Chinain China is critical of the latest knowledge:
In a report from London, the State Agency Xinhua spoke of a “remarkable piece of highly technological detective work”, but Chinese experts are by no means convinced of the work of Inmarsat.Without debris, the conclusions were drawn "a bit blind", it is said.It takes “for a long time” to verify the results, says Aviation expert Wu Peixin of the “China Daily”.
In China, proofs are called.Inmarsat, according to its own statements, had already sent the analysis of the whereabouts of the aircraft to the person responsible in Malaysia on March 11, three days after the machine disappeared.A day later, they informed the British authorities.
Nevertheless, Malaysia initially drove the search in the South China Sea and on the street of Malakka.McLaughlin may not be criticized: "The investigation authorities in Malaysia had to deal with a huge data and with neighbors with whom they do not understand themselves perfectly." For McLaughlin, it is clear that such a disappearance of a scheduled aircraft could be prevented.
The technology enables the automatic shipping of SMS-like messages via satellite, which provide information about speed, time and position.Even after the Air France Airbus crashed, this system was challenged, as is common in shipping.The international organization of Civil Aviation (ICAO) works on a satellite -based air traffic control.
So far, there is usually a communication with shortwave radio over the sea, there is no radar.Innovations in international aviation can only be introduced slowly.The search for ruins did not advance on Tuesday;
Bad weather prevented the missions.The satellite system Inmarsat covers the oceans, and has now been used for the first time for a search.Photo: Andrew Winning (Reuters)

Where are the wreckage?/ / Beijing / Kuala Lumpur Officially, flight MH370 was declared lost and the hope for survivors under the passengers of the Malaysia aircraft.The sufferers are still suspicious and demand evidence.
Hundreds of members of the majority of Chinese aircraft inmates finally asked for answers to their most agonizing questions yesterday in Beijing: Where are the wreckage?And what's behind the hourly strawfall over the ocean?
Desperate relatives angrily answered answers in front of the Malaysian embassy in Beijing."Bring our relatives back," screamed around 200 bereaved, who had previously marched to the message with concentrated fists and tears in their eyes in their eyes in arm in arm by a hotel of the Chinese capital.Demonstrations on Beijing's streets are a rare picture, but the authorities sometimes put an eye on protests against foreign goals.
In this case, China is also particularly affected: 153 Chinese were on flight MH370.China calls for evidence even protected by police officers and traffic at the surrounding intersections stopped.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained in solidarity and called for “evidence and information” to harden the shattering finding of Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak.
The latter announced on Monday, citing satellite data, that the Boeing 777 of Malaysia Airlines had fallen in the southern Indian Ocean.The head of the Malaysian civil aviation authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahma, specified yesterday: «The last known position of the aircraft was above the Indian ocean, it could hardly have been on board at the time, there was no country nearby - far and wide -We can conclude that the machine ended in the water.»The region is very remote, the sea Rau.
«It is extremely unlikely that someone survived there for 17 or 18 days.»No wreck part has been found so far.Nobody knows whether the machine crashed or hit water in gliding.
Surface people on Ort the bereaved should now be allowed to get an idea of the location on site.
According to Malaysia Airlines, preparations are made to bring relatives to the “salvage zone”.Australian government representatives indicated that the relatives would enact the usual visa fees.It is also questionable whether the fate of the aircraft, which was lost on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing to Beijing with 239 inmates, is still questionable if the flight data writer - whose radio signals will soon dry up - should be found.

Solid skyguide with perspectives / / The air protection company Skyguide has completed the past year better than in 2012. The decisive factor was cost management.
The future project is the virtual merging of the two large surveillance centers.P. S. · The Swiss flight security company
Skyguide is challenged by the continued acceptance of traffic in Swiss airspace - in 2013 it decreased by 2.5 percent to 1.142 million flight movements.In 2012 the decline was 1.8 percent.
The main reason for this is the transit traffic over Switzerland, which becomes less, as CEO Daniel neither performed in front of the media on Tuesday.Nevertheless, thanks to tight cost management, Skyguide succeeded in better in 2013 with an operating result (EBIT) of CHF 33.59 million better than in 2012 (29.95 million), if the fees are reduced by 2 percent.Compensation with other words:
Skyguide has succeeded in reducing the costs with a minus of 1.3 percent;This is more than the decline in income by 0.4 percent.The company continues on the path, on which it wants to compensate for the cost subcontracts consciously in recent years by 2019.
Since 2012, Skyguide has been compensated by the BUND for its unused expenses in favor of regional airports and for services that provide it through Germany, Austria and Italy.This is different in the case of France.This neighboring country pays Skyguide based on a state contract for benefits on its territory.
In a Europe -wide rating of the security cultures, Skyguide ranks among the top five of a total of 44 flight security companies tested, and in the past ten years the delays caused by Skyguide have been reduced by 80 percent.In 2013, 96.5 percent of all flights could be handled on time, and there was a negative outer outer in June due to bad weather conditions.If the Swissair once contested 40 percent of the flights to be monitored in Switzerland, the SWISS share is around 20 percent today.
In places 2 and 3, Lufthansa and Easy Jet follow with proportions of 10 or a little less percent.Virtual merging of the next few years wants to profile Skyguide with innovation projects.On the one hand, there are further rationalization steps in order to approach the otherwise common cost level, on the other hand, the company promises additional income.
The weight and lump risk of pure traffic income should be reduced by other income, especially by those that result from innovations.The focus is currently on the virtual merging of the surveillance centers in Geneva and Zurich.Access to the data of both centers should be possible from both locations, so that air traffic can be controlled from Geneva from Geneva during the night.

An air force without weapons / / The Swiss Air Force only flies during office hours - and even then it cannot shoot it.These two handicaps should be remedied until six years - but only when the grip comes, says Federal Councilor Maurer.
Markus Häfliger, Payernedass The Swiss Air Force is only operational during office hours, became aware of a general public on February 17 when an Ethiopian pilot kidnapped a transport aircraft to Geneva.But time availability is not the only handicap of the Air Force:
Even if she flies, it could not shoot a Kamikaze pilot that is determined by all-for example if this course takes a course on a nuclear power plant.This second handicap became clear to a demonstration at Payerne airfield, to which the Defense Department (VBS) had invited the media.During the demonstration, the fighting pilots showed that they have the air police service under control and train almost every day - be it in the simulator or in the air.
However, their fighter jets are only armed in special locations - for example if they control the closed airspace for Davos during the World Economic Forum (WEF).Armification lasts hourly of normal layers, they have neither steering weapons nor ammunition for the on -board cannons - this applies not only to training flights, but even to "hot missions".The pilots speak of this when they have to identify and accompany an airplane that does not respond to radio sayings or behaves irregularly.
Such “hot missions” would certainly be around ten times a year, it said in Payerne.At the latest since September 11, 2001 it has been known that non -answering aircraft can serve as an attack weapon in the worst case.In such cases, the fighting pilot could only try to communicate or push it out with winged wagons, light torches or hand signals with the other aircraft.
If a fighter jet had to be armed in an emergency, "it would take hours," said Brigadier Werner Epper, the new head of the air force.Switzerland has concluded contracts with three neighboring countries that allow German, French and Italian jets to pursue suspicious aircraft on Swiss territory.However, weapons use is prohibited from the foreign jets.
Now the Air Force wants to correct its two handicaps.It has already announced that the VBS is aiming for 24-hour use in the medium term.The starting signal for the Ilana project (intervention options for the Air Force outside of normal working hours) was recently given.
As part of this project, not only - as previously known - the willingness to work is increased, but also the level of standards for the use of weapons, explains Epper.The Gripen, as a condition of the VBS, is to have an Air Force until 2020, which is operational for 365 days.This is not faster because the training of the additional pilots lasts six years, said Defense Minister Ueli Maurer in Payerne.
Including the mechanics and air traffic controllers, around 100 men are required.For this 24-hour operation, however, Maurer now provides a condition: If the people reject the purchase of the 22 gripen jets on May 18, Ilana cannot be implemented.Maurer justifies this with the fact that the 32 f / a fight jets reach the end of their lifespan around 2030.
Without buying new aircraft, Switzerland would have no fighter jets from 2030.That would mean that the 100 people were only trained for 10 years.That would be a "straw fire", according to Maurer, for which the investment of CHF 30 million would not be worthwhile.

Maurer and the Propaganda Markt Propagandamarkus Häfliger (Hä) Hä.
Payerne · Regularly Ueli Maurer invites the media to a “barrack conversation”.At the recent edition in Payerne, the defense minister presented the Air Force (see main article) - and took the opportunity to make extensive advertising for the grip.
For the gripen, Maurer also fought across Switzerland in the coming weeks.According to his own statements, he appears on 21 occasions until the vote of May 18 to promote the new fighter jet.For comparison: SP Federal Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga had appeared 15 times against the mass immigration initiative before February 9.
Maurers Tour de Gripen contrasts with the position of his party, which has been denouncing the Federal Council's “Propaganda” for years and also supported the so -called muzzle -corbitiative in 2008.This referendum would have prohibited the Federal Council on "information and propaganda activity" before voting.Maurer voted in the National Council, at that time as SVP President, for the initiative.
When asked about the contradiction between his position at the time and today's activities, Maurer says: «I don't do a campaign, I inform.»There was still a lot of false information on the gripen, which must be corrected by the population.And then Maurer added this sentence: "I have a different role today as a Federal Council than at that time as party president." Fighter jet Gripeneidgenössische People's vote on May 18, 2014 "
So not »hu.Payerne · His interview with the "Weltwoche" "was not really successful".
This was said by Federal Councilor Ueli Maurer in Payerne at his first media appearance since the interview, in which he had criticized Federal President Didier Burkhalter's foreign policy (NZZ 21, 14).In the interview it has passages that "don't go like this".Among other things, Maurer had described the takeover of the OSCE Presidium as incompatible with Swiss neutrality.

Satellite images show 122 objects / / Perth.The search for the crashed Malaysian machine continued yesterday after a weather improvement.
New satellite images have aroused hope to find the wreckage of the crashed Malaysia Airlines machine.The recordings of the Airbus subsidiary "Airbus Defense and Space" showed a rubble field with 122 in the Indian Ocean, said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein on Wednesday."We have to emphasize that we do not know whether these objects belonged to flight MH370," he said.
None of the possible fragments have yet been found.The search for the words of Prime Minister Tony Abbott cannot continue searching for an exact crash station Australia."We are still looking for because we are guilty of doing everything to solve this puzzle," said Abbott yesterday in parliament.
The search was "not completely unlimited, but this is not something that we would easily give up". China's head of government said there was no effort.Most of the 239 aircraft occupants were Chinese origin.According to researchers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the crash site due to the turbulent current in the sea area.
Any wreckage parts are probably much too deprived than that reliable information on their origins could still be given, said David Griffin, oceanographer of the Australian research institute CSIRO, and according to Husseins, some parts are up to 23 meters long on the new satellite images.The recordings came from last Sunday and showed the region in which there is already a search with aircraft and ships: about 2500 kilometers southwest of Perth in Australia.Finding the exact crash site is still a top priority.
There, the fuselage of the machine would have to lie on the sea floor, with the flightwriters on board.The investigators hope that this will provide information about the cause of the straw.After the start in Kuala Lumpur, the machine had deviated from the course to Beijing and without functioning communication systems for up to eight hours - as long as the fuel was enough - flown south.
Why is unclear.Relatives switch on lawyers of one of the flight data recorders and the voice recorder sparks their position, but a directional transmitter must at least be nearby to catch the signal.
After 30 days, the batteries of the Blackbox named the writer, that would be on April 7th.Meanwhile, some of the relatives of the lost passengers were committed by lawyers from the US Chancellery Ribbeck.Now Boeing and Malaysia Airlines threaten a lawsuit: the background is the assumption that the machine crashed due to a technical error.
2014
Still no tangible evidence / / from the Boeing 777, no ruins have yet been recovered.Now lawyers are also involved.
When looking for the lost Malaysian passenger plane, the indications of the alleged crash area are condensed.The Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Wednesday said that over a hundred parts of the sea can be seen on new satellite images.The objects could be debris of the Boeing 777.
122 parts were absorbed in a 400 square kilometer area by a French satellite."We now have four series of pictures of satellites from Australia, China and France, where possible wreckage parts can be seen," said Hussein.Search aircraft also viewed alleged wreckage.
So far, none of the rubble pieces has been recovered due to bad weather.This still has a final proof of the whereabouts of the aircraft and the 239 people on board.Search only from the ship of the Australian port city of Perth, American devices were prepared for the search for the flight descriptions.
An unmanned mini submarine and a sensor for the localization of the black boxes are then to be brought from a ship of the Australian navy to the search area in the Indian Ocean.According to the Malaysian government, the ship should only reach the alleged crash site on April 5.So only a few days left for the search.
The black boxes send their location signals, if at all, only as long as their batteries are intact.Lawyers want placement investigators to believe that the automatic location systems were switched off at the flight MH 370 and the aircraft flew towards Beijing towards Beijing towards the Indian Ocean.The causes of the straw are unknown, but lawyers from Chicago now suspect that the machine has crashed due to a technical error and therefore prepare a lawsuit.
The US law firm Ribbeck said that she expects the families of more than half of the passengers.An application had already been made before a court in the state of Illinois in order to be able to determine possible construction or manufacturing deficiencies from Boeing 777.In addition to compensation in the millions for the bereaved, Boeing should also call for a revision of the entire 777 fleet.
The law firm suspects as the reason for the disappearance that pilot and co-pilot have passed out.The cause may be either a fire due to a technical defect or a drop in pressure in the cabin after damage to the aircraft.(Reuters)

Nobody was waiting for Ryanair / / from Rahel Koerfgeneuropa's biggest low-cost airline is back at the EuroAirport: Ryanair London-Stansted has been flying since Saturday and from today the Irish capital Dublin- three times a week.
With a total of ten connections, Ryanair promotes an estimated 140,000 passengers every year from Basel.Of course, this is not yet much, quite insignificant if you put the number in relation: this year the EuroAirport will record more than six million passengers, more than ever.
The lion's share of over 50 percent will climb into an Easyjet aircraft.Nevertheless-and probably also to do justice to his reputation as a provocateur-the infamous Ryanair boss Michael O 'Leary recently played up in an interview with the newspaper “Switzerland am Sonntag” as Savior of Basel Airport: Basel was a sub-pageDestination in Switzerland;
Ryanair would now deliver traffic growth.The Irishman who spoiled success has taken his mouth quite full.The last time the EuroAirport was in 2003, the year when the Swiss Tabula Rasa, who was badly ailing at the time, made almost all destinations.
The number of passengers dropped to measly 2.5 million.But then Easyjet discovered Basel Airport, and the rest is history.Today the low -cost airline flies almost 50 destinations in Europe from Basel.
Insiders even rumor that the British could soon also serve Moscow from Basel.The EuroAirport is therefore not dependent on the rescue by Mister O ’Leary.However, it is gratifying that Ryanair will perform another strong player at Basel Airport - or in this case: return, because Ryanair offers interesting perspectives for the EuroAirport with regard to destinations:
The airport is not connected to Scandinavian destinations, you can look at Copenhagen.Ryanair has travel destinations like Stockholm in the route network - and it is quite possible that the Swedish capital will be flown from Basel this year.Ryanair at least makes no secret of the fact that in Basel will soon be expanded:
The possibility would exist, it sounds from Dublin, but first you have to wait for the delivery of the new Boeing 737 - 800 that would be delivered in autumn.And then it really starts.But maybe the Irish are gone as quickly as they returned to Basel.
Because Easyjet is a tough opponent, not least because of the fact that the British under the leadership of ex-publishing manager Carolyn McCall have noticeably improved the service on the floor and on board in the past two years.Easyjet is and remains a low-cost airline, but you are (almost) not adhered to anything cheap: the stewardesses now wear well-fitting costumes and smile every now and then, most Easyjet machines start and land on time, and you have to end up on board, and you have to go around the seat on boardno longer fight because every passenger is assigned a permanent place at check-in.
Ryanair, on the other hand, fights with image problems.This and the success of Easyjet and also golf airlines like Etihad Regional, which are pushing dumping prices to the European market, led to Ryanair slipped into the red between October and December and has thus flown in the worst result since 2008.The airline had previously waited even cheaper tickets to offer the competition.
In fact, until recently, the price was the only argument to fly with the Irish.Bad service and a male handling of the passengers were on the agenda at Ryanair."I saw people who cried after a Ryanair flight," said small shareholder Owen O ’Reilly at the last general assembly in September 2013.
Nobody had complained loudly for a long time, but that has changed in the past few months.Michael O ’Leary and his entourage had to endure a veritable shitstorm.Not only on the Internet on Twitter or Facebook, but also in the cabin.
In January, passengers on the flight from Rabat to Paris-Beauvais were so angry that there was a riot on board a Ryanair machine: after an hour-long odyssey, passengers freaked out and began to ride on the plane;They looted the alcohol and cigarette supplies and took everything that was valuable.
We all want to fly cheaply, but not at all costs.Above all, we don't want tears to come to us on a trip.Michael O ’Leary has now seen that.
«We are now trying to be nice to our customers.You can only get a certain time with deep prices, ”he told“ Switzerland on Sunday ”.In response to the shitstorm and the red figures, he initiated a charm offensive at the beginning of the year, which should be connected with better service.
Reserved seats such as Easyjet are part of it, but also that customers can now take a small extra baggage piece on board and that the suitcase travels in the loading room for half of the previous price.Also that Ryanair increasingly flies main airports or at least larger airports, such as Madrid, Rome or Basel.Sounds somehow better than Hahn, Weeze or Memmingen.
An astonishing change when you consider that the same man had talked about standing room and toilet penny less than five years ago.Michael O ’Leary has significantly deviated from his main concept in the past few months.He is under enormous pressure, Ryanair is increasingly seeing himself in the defense fight.
In order to be able to defend its position as a leading cheap flight provider in Europe, Ryanair has to turn away from the original low -cost airline model and become better qualitatively.The success is right.However, this does not mean that the low -cost transporters will go under in Europe.
But in the future they will be less and less similar to a classic low -cost airline as we know it from before.Good service is required, despite the low prices.The golf carriers do it.
It will take a while until O ’Leary's new concept has also reached the employees.These have been polished on male for years - and a corporate culture cannot be changed overnight.Therefore, Ryanair will probably stand out for a long time with negative headlines.
And that's why there is a big question mark behind the certainty of the victory of O ’Leary at Basel EuroAirport.It is unlikely that Ryanair will mix up the market at the EuroAirport.Rather, the airline will probably be a niche player.
The “avarice is cool” mentality is the German, the Swiss less or only up to a certain pain limit.And they make up the strongest nationality at EuroAirport.I've never flown with Ryanair and I don't know if I will ever do it.

Gripen: "An expensive and unnecessary risk" / / Air Force ·
In view of empty health insurance companies, cantons and municipalities, the purchase of 22 gripen fighter aircraft is out of the question for the “No to the fighter jet millions” alliance.In the eyes of National Councilor Evi Allemann (SP, BE), business is associated with a whole series of risks: One of them is the dependency on Sweden as a country of manufacturers and the United States as the most important supplier.
It was only this weekend that the radio and the encryption technology of the ordered model come from the USA."With the grip we also buy a piece of NSA," said Allemann yesterday.The security politician sees another risk in the high down payment that Switzerland has to make for an aircraft that only exists on paper.
What is happening exactly if the plane is not delivered with the desired configurations or not at all, the security policy commission did not make it clear, said Allemann. "Overpriced paper plane", the focus is on the high costs for the opponents of the fight.The procurement of the 22 aircraft comes to a little more than CHF 3.1 billion.
Over the entire operation, the jets would cost taxpayers around CHF 10 billion, said Juso President Fabian Molina.In addition to purchase and maintenance, this also includes the costs for operation, weapons, fuel or the necessary properties.This money would be better spent on education, social security or public transport, said Molina.
Investments in these areas would contribute far more to the prosperity and security of the population than “overpriced paper planes”. The gripen is said to replace the aging tiger fighter aircraft.The voting is decided on May 18 on the Gripen Fund Act.This forms the basis for the financing of the 22 gripen.sda

Berlin wants to push back unions of the privileged / / a pilot strike since yesterday the Lufthansa Lahm.The government demands a "quick solution" - and wants to circumcise the power of influential lobby clubs.
David Nauer Berlin is probably the biggest strike in the history of German aviation: since yesterday a large part of the Lufthansa fleet has remained on the ground.
Around 5400 pilots want to refuse work by Friday.They fight for a wage increase of 10 percent and maintaining the privilege of being able to retire at the age of 55.So far, the large chaos at the German airports has failed to materialize, Lufthansa has informed most of the passengers in advance.
Nevertheless, the effects are serious: the airline has deleted around 3800 flights, and 425,000 travelers are affected.Experts appreciate the damage to a high double -digit million amount.
The federal government is concerned.It demands a “quick solution”, as Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said yesterday.The Vice President of the Union Group in the Bundestag, Arnold Vaatz, opened the strike openly:
The proportionality must also be maintained in tariff conflicts, he said.Pilots criticize “profit greed” Lufthansa considers the pilots' demands over and refer to the sharp competition in the industry.
The largest airline is put under pressure by cheap airlines and strong competition from the Arab world.The cockpit pilot union, on the other hand, accuses the group "profit greed".She criticizes that employees should make a savings contribution to "massively increase the dividend".
Accordingly, the hill call of the industrial actioners is: "Pilots take responsibility, grasshoppers the profits." The special thing about the Lufthansa strike: the pilots are a relative small but powerful group.Because you are sitting at the switching point, you can paralyze an entire group - and cause considerable economic damage.
In addition, the strikers are not exactly paid.A co-pilot gets 73,000 euros at the beginning of his career, a flight captain can earn up to 255,000 euros.Regardless of the soil staff, owe the Lufthansa pilots of the Cockpit Association.
The small union with 9,300 members exclusively represents its interests and can act accordingly.A trend that is also available in other industries.Doctors or train drivers have also turned away from the traditional major unions in recent years and founded small lobby clubs to better enforce their interests.
The black and red federal government sees this development critically because more and smaller unions also mean more industrial struggles.The SPD also fears that privileged workers with their noble unions will disconnect from the “soil staff”.Minister of Labor Andrea Nahles (SPD) already gives countermeasures, as she explained in Berlin yesterday.
Your ministry is currently working on a law with which the so -called tariff unit is to be restored.This means that employers can only lead wage negotiations with the union that has the most members in the relevant company.The result is then valid for everyone.
Solidarity between strong and weak workers is needed, said Nahles.It is still unclear when the new regulation will come because it is not easy to find a constitutional form.The unions on their part have already announced resistance against the plans.
The legislative initiative is “critical and negative,” said Frank Bsirske, the head of the Verdi service union.The fact that Verdi has the majority of unionized employees in the Lufthansa Group cannot lead to the pilot association Cockpit cold.His union is not available to undercut the Cockpit collective agreements, says Bsirske.
"Then we would make ourselves a hand-reached employer." If the small union of the pilots wants it, the Lufthansa fleet remains on the ground.Photo: Adam Berry (Bloomberg) Effects on Switzerland, Falls Flights Ausam Airport Zurich, 36 flights had to be canceled on Wednesday.Connections to Düsseldorf, Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne are affected.
The destinations Hamburg and Cologne would have been flown by the Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings.According to an airport spokesman, 22 flights are expected to fall out on the second day of the strike and on Friday, the last day of the strike, their 20th at Basel-Mülhausen Airport, three back and forth flights between the euro airport and Frankfurt were deleted, like itAt the airport on request was called.A cancellation has also been known for Thursday.
A total of 10 flights were canceled in Geneva on Wednesday.At Swiss, around 2000 customers are affected by the strikes - mainly because they booked a connecting flight with Lufthansa.The passengers were informed and largely rebooked or canceled their flights.
At the same time, the subsidiary of Lufthansa relies on larger aircraft on the Zurich-Hannover and Zurich Munich men.The SBB, however, try to capitalize on Lufthansa strike.They switch advertisements in newspapers and on certain websites, where sayings were read, such as “land safely despite pilot strike” or “land safely in Germany”.
Such a display was found on the online portal of the Zurich airport - right next to the information on the canceled flights.A spokesman said to “20 minutes” that SBB could also expand the capacities on certain routes if the demand would request the request."In the direction of Munich, for example, it would theoretically be possible." This is not unrealistic.
In Germany, the train expects up to 20,000 additional passengers during the strike.It is therefore planning with more employees and has reserve trains, as Jürgen Kornmann from Deutsche Bahn explained.Around 360,000 people travel with the company on normal days.

Shortly / / / Victoria-Jungs takeover perfect
Aevis has completed the takeover of the Victoria Jungfrau Collection (VJC).It now holds 71.47 percent of the share capital.At the latest at the VJC General Assembly on May 28, Aevis wants to inform how the luxury hotel group will continue.
Formally came about for fair traffic financing.113 306 of the signatures submitted are valid, as the Federal Chancellery announced.100,000 valid signatures would be necessary.
The dairy cow initiative requires that the yields from mineral oil tax flow into the construction and operation of national roads as well as in infrastructure measures.This makes it possible to work at the lowest possible costs and attract the best employees, the company said.
The shares are only to be traded in New York.Museum director Jürg Studer confirmed a corresponding message in the "Blick".

EU moves climate levy for continental flights / / The EU has postponed the introduction of the controversial tax to 2017.The EU Parliament confirmed a compromise negotiated with the EU countries yesterday.
The EU will only charge climate tax on continental flights from 2017.This would originally have been planned for this spring.Because this has been in effect for flights within the EU since 2012.
Airlines have to show so -called pollution certificates when they start and land in the EU.This is supposed to make aircraft more expensive with a strong emission emissions and slow down climate change.However, the involvement of non -European flights planned by the EU had encountered violent resistance - especially from the United States, Russia and China.
They criticized that the routes outside the EU would also be subject to a fee if only the start or landing resort in Europe were.Switzerland is not a third -country -said, the EU had given in and suspended the system for third countries - except for Switzerland.The fact that this was treated like an EU member state was less well received in Bern.
For its part, the EU Commission found that Switzerland has a comparable attitude on climate-political questions as the EU.In addition, she referred to the negotiations that have been running since 2011 on a link between Switzerland and the EU's emission trade systems.After accepting the immigration initiative on February 9, the negotiations were put on hold.
Last October, at the conference of the International Civil Aviation Society (ICAO), it was agreed to develop and introduce internationally applicable standards by 2020.However, the compromise, which is good for the EU Parliament, provides for a somewhat narrower schedule.The next ICAO meeting will take place in 2016.
According to the compromise, the EU countries must also disclose what they use the income from the auctioned pollution certificates.Because the income should serve to combat climate change and finance research and development - for example for low -pollutants.The law must now be approved by the EU Member States (Council).

EU examines the influence of Etihad at Air Berlin / / Frankfurt / Athens.The EU Commission is investigating the influence of the Arab Air Society Etihad near Air Berlin.
She wants to check whether the participation of the financially strong airline from the Golf Emirate Abu Dhabi is compatible with European law.The Commission is currently investigating some non-EU investments in European airlines, including Etihad's participation in Germany's second largest airline, explained a spokesman for EU transport commissioner SIIM Kallas.He thus confirmed a report by the “Süddeutsche Zeitung”. Darin it was said that a group of airlines had put pressure on examining the participation of Etihad near Air Berlin.
The rivals believed that, despite a proportion of only 29.2 percent, Etihad has long since had the say at Air Berlin.For Air Berlin, the process could mean trouble.According to a European directive, EU member states can only issue an operating permit if shareholders from the Member States hold more than 50 percent of the companies and at the same time effectively exercise control.
According to the EU spokesman, the Member State concerned was therefore asked to provide further information on how these investments are in line with the rules for owning and control of European airlines.Air Berlin rejected the allegations."Of course, Etihad Airways does not exercise control at Air Berlin," said a spokesman.
Etihad is represented on the Air Berlin board of directors with two out of a total of eleven people.«Strategic decisions are at Air Berlin alone.As a shareholder, Etihad does not have a blocking minority or special rights, »said the spokesman.
Air Berlin had recently surprisingly postponed the balance sheet.The airline is indebted with a good 800 million euros, the equity has long been completely consumed.Etihad has already brought money injections of half a billion euros and benefits in Air Berlin since the start of Air Berlin in 2011.
Air Berlin sold his frequent flyer program to Etihad to get money.After Swiss, strong competitor of Swissair Berlin is the second most important airline at Zurich Airport.Their share of flight movements was only 5.5 percent last year, further behind the 56.8 percent of the national airline;
Air Berlin comes in front of the Swiss subsidiary Edelweiss, who came to 3.7 percent.Air-Berlin-Grossaktonär Etihad also wants to take over the shares of the Ticino Darwin Airline, which has already appeared regionally as an Etihad.
In long -haul traffic to the Middle East, Asia and Africa, Etihad has now become a strong competitor of the Swiss and other traditional European fairlines with large and modern aircraft.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) checks whether Etihad is still controlled by Switzerland.Bazl spokesman Urs Holderegger recently told the BAZ, "check whether the so-called ownership-and-control conditions are met".

Arabs get Berliner for Italy / / Abu Dhabi / Berlin / Rome.Air Berlin and Alitalia could work more closely together in the future.
If the entry of Arabic Etihad works with the Italians, they also want to integrate the battered German airline.Etihad boss James Hogan said that negotiations with Air Berlin were about to expand her cooperation."All of our ideas were fulfilled and we are in the final phase of negotiations for the next level of our partnership," he said yesterday.
Etihad is already involved in the German airline with 29 percent.The Italian newspaper “La Repubblica” reported that Etihad had already submitted its plans for an introduction to Alitalia to the government in Rome.Etihad wants to put up to $ 350 million in the Italian airline.
Hogan only said that the Alitalia books are currently being examined.If the deal comes about, Alitalia employees must adapt to the loss of another 2500 jobs according to the newspaper.The number of employees would fall to less than 10,000.
According to the report, Alitalia should then rely on the long -distance business.The flight offer within Europe should shrink around a fifth.Etihad also wanted to bring Air Berlin to the Alitalia boat, it was said.
Etihad got involved in the Germans in 2011 and has since built Air Berlin into a feeder for her long -haul flights.At Air Berlin, Etihad is faced with a further increase in his share, as the German “Handelsblatt” reported.Accordingly, the Arabs want to expand their share to 49.5 percent.

Letters to the editor / / "Various output subject topic gripen"
The ideal aircraft »from the opponents of the gripen procurement is always emphasized that the replacement of the Tiger fighter aircraft is not necessary and that the existing F / A-18 fleet is completely sufficient.This is not the case because the full number is never available for a fleet - be it due to periodic maintenance, repairs or upgrades of the aircraft.
It is also the most normal in the world that the Tiger fleet has to be replaced after over thirty years.Which company or institution would want to run your production or tasks with outdated infrastructure?The Swiss Army Air Force has its order according to the constitution and can only fulfill it if it is granted the necessary funds.
Gripen E is the ideal aircraft for Switzerland.It already flies in the form of a prototype today and is not - as always claimed - a paper flyer.Peter Kohler, Wasen i.E. edition of April 10th.
"The feeder brings nothing" by Marzella Inversini "Conditions are unsustainable" I agree with Mrs. Inversini right: Nobody wants traffic, eradication and land wear.But the traffic does not go away by ignoring it.
On the contrary .Much suggests that it will rather increase, regardless of whether the bypass is built or not.The conditions in Aarwangen have long been unsustainable for the residents.

It was noticed that cannabis users were largely due to another crime, had been neglected, were neglected or suffered from psychological problems.If cannabis consumption in Switzerland was released, this would be an invitation for drug users from all over Europe.Soon it would mean that Switzerland is enriched by drug use.
After the banking scandal there would be a drug scandal.The comment from the so -called drug experts, according to which the case law regarding drug use failed, is not understandable.Then you could also pick up the top speed on the streets, since the speed is not met every day.
The same would apply to theft.This crime could be deleted entirely from the code of law, since such a crime is carried out practically every hour.Do we really want to go the path of the slightest resistance to the drug users?

As a sports doctor, however, I find the fitness test presented extremely questionable, since the focus is on the time duration of the strength exercise.Instead, in health sports, it should primarily be emphasized on the correct implementation of a force exercise - especially to avoid incorrect loads and resulting consequential damage.There is no test that can be used to adequately judge all of the conditioning (strength, speed, speed, endurance, coordination).
However, there are recognized test procedures that can be used to assess the core stabilization, the endurance performance, the speed, the jumping power and so on.In the short term, this “Hau-Ruck method” may lead to quick progress, but a sustainable effect is hardly guaranteed.Alexandra Kronenberg Spiegel at Bern edition of March 28th to «Konolfingen:

Letters of the letters / / "Various output topic are gripen"
The really smart? »22 Gripen aircraft should protect Switzerland's airspace in the future-or at least make air space appear more modern over the WEF sky.Our military flight police protect us Swiss gross during office hours.From when to when they go, it is not entirely clear.
Let us assume that the pilots and the technical staff will start work at 8 a.m., the first gripen would be in the air at 8.45 a.m. at the earliest.When the office hours ended at 5 p.m., the last grip would have to land at 4.15 p.m.This results in a net operation of 7.3 hours a day.
And the emergency for CHF 3.2 billion.Is that really smart?Ueli Bachmann, Hinterkappelen "Gripen meets the requirements"
The army must also be able to make its contribution every day for long -term protection from the country, population and economy against a wide variety of threats.Your complex protection systems cannot be procured at short notice.In critical situations, the army on the ground is only possible under a sustainable aircraft.
Also, there is no alternative to combat aircraft in the foreseeable future.The gripen meets all requirements, it is the cheapest solution for procurement and operating costs.Financing takes place from the army that have already been spoken by the army.
If the template is rejected, not a single franc would be available for social issues, education and so on.Emil Roth, Gümligen "an even deeper hole in the cash register" while the red pencil is ruled in almost all cantons, tremendous sums are spoken in Bern.
As with the UBS rescue campaign, politics argues extensively for relatively insignificant amounts, while billions of finance are approved Subito.If the VBS were a child, the parents would tell him: «Rum Zutch uf, because Gits de Zvieri!»Lost tanks, computer science breakdowns and an air force that is only operational during office hours:
The real problem of the army is not too small fleet.Also 22 gripes will not remedy these basic defects in the concept of the Swiss army.You will only leave an even deeper hole in the federal treasury.

Those who do not deal with political events every day have little chance of forming their own opinion on political questions.Professional requirements in adolescence, leisure activities and apolitical parents are not good soil for political education.Ultimately, there are only incentives (raffles in elections and votes) or the compulsory voting to improve the political participation of the boys.

A complete flight monitoring would be possible / / The tragedy of flight MH370 highlights the fact that there is still no complete flight monitoring over large parts of the earth.The technical possibilities for this would now be available.
Was flight MH370 victim of an accident, or was the disappearance of the machine the result of a terrorist attack?Has the plane been shot down or kidnapped by passengers or even the crew?Could the Boeing not water, or plunged it into the sea at a steep corner and quickly sank?
We may have to wait months or years for answers, and maybe the disappearance of MH370 will never even be clarified at all.But how can it be that in times when everyone can be located via his mobile phone within seconds, a line aircraft of the latest generation simply disappears without a trace?But above all: How can this be prevented in the future?
Air traffic has been monitored by radar since the end of the Second World War.At that time primary radar systems were developed to locate enemy planes.However, these systems have a limited range of only around 100 kilometers.
Therefore, so -called transponders, which react to a radar beam and send a message back from the aircraft.Such so -called secondary radar systems today have a range of just over 300 kilometers.Monitoring only with gaps flies outside of this radar zone, for example on longer distances over the sea or over uninhabited areas, the procedure of the so -called procedural Air Traffic Control is applied.
This means nothing other than reporting the crew by radio to fly over defined reporting points and the estimated time that is needed to the next reporting point.The fact that a considerable part of the commercial aviation is not under active surveillance during longer sections should also be unknown to most frequent flyers.However, modern aircraft with their technical complexity must remain in connection with the home base and the maintenance department in order to recognize deviations or disorders of the systems on board early.
The aviation industry has therefore developed the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), through which technical data is regularly transmitted via ground stations or satellites.In addition, short text messages can also be exchanged between the crew and the home base.The transmission of the data on this communication channel, which is operated by private providers, costs money, because each message is offset according to the extent.
The airlines therefore limit the frequency with which technical data is sent to intervals from 15 to - in the case of Malaysia Airways - 30 minutes.Position reports are also sent for cost reasons, because national flight surveillance organizations and their customers are not willing to bear the high costs.Digital system as a remedy of over ten years was developed in the United States that a new technology was developed, which enables a seamless flight monitoring relatively inexpensively:
The so-called automatic deposit Surveillance Broadcast System (ADS-B).It digitally transmits the position and other flight data without having to cover the aircraft by a radar.After the successful introduction to Alaska, where the accident rate of the bush pilot there decreased by over 40 percent thanks to ADS B, the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ADS-B from 2020 decided to be mandatory, and has started, and has started, and has started, andto set up ads-B floor stations across the board in the USA.
The advantages of ADS-B were also recognized in Europe, and the introduction in the same period as in the USA is in preparation.For their part, the aircraft manufacturers have been equipping all scheduled aircraft for years with transponders that can also send an ADS-B signal.That is why around 60 percent of all transport aircraft are already equipped with ADS B.
Flight MH370 also broadcast the position via ADS-B and was located by various, sometimes private ground stations-but only until the machine had disappeared from the radius of about 300 kilometers of the ground stations.However, ADS-B signals can also be received by satellites.At the moment, attempts from private providers such as Iridium and Globalstar will take place, which in the future would finally allow a complete monitoring of the position worldwide to a fraction of the costs of acars.
Such a global coverage of air traffic by satellites could not only include position messages, but also ensure permanent monitoring of all aircraft systems and the crew.Today, over 4000 parameters are monitored in the flight writer (Flight Data Recorder), which is installed in every scheduled aircraft and stored on data carriers.In addition, conversations and noises are recorded in the cockpit voice recorder.
But these two devices can be destroyed or lost with the plane, which makes it impossible to clarify the cause of the accident.That was also the reason why the French state was not afraid of costs and for two years with special submarines the black box of the machine of the flight AF447 crashed above the South Atlantic and finally found it.obstacle
Cost printing the problem that the all -important data can be lost with the plane itself would be relatively easy to solve today: Instead of storing the data, it could be transmitted in short periods of time via satellite or via a floor station.However, the mandatory introduction of such a global position and data surveillance system depends on the willingness of the individual states in which an aircraft and an airline is registered, and- in the event of international airspace- on multilateral conventions.
Such an agreement for a global air monitoring system would have to be decided and implemented by the International Aviation Authority (ICAO).As long as such an agreement, the modalities of which must be anchored in the national legislation of all states, but missing, the airlines, which are under constant cost pressure, will not incorporate new systems because they fear higher operating costs.But it cannot and must not be that in the 21st century most modern commercial aircraft can no longer be monitored and located from a distance of 300 kilometers to a ground station.
Perhaps the tragedy of flight MH 370 gets the stone rolling, which finally enables the introduction of a global comprehensive air monitoring system.Charles E. Schlumberger works as a aviation expert at the World Bank in Washington.Should no longer be necessary:

The fear of evil golf / / In order to boost their growth, golf states rely on the aviation industry.Investments are also made in Switzerland:
Almost 4,000 jobs in the industry depend on capital from the Golf region.By Simone Schmidsie seem to have immeasurable resources.They grow while others shrink.
And they have been going on a shopping tour in Europe for years: airlines from the golf region teach the European airlines fear.In Switzerland, Airline Etihad from Abu Dhabi is currently causing red heads.The company is suspected of controlling the Swiss regional airline Darwin Airline despite the minority stake-as a airline from a non-EU state, Etihad must not do so in the law.
Etihad already has shares in Air Berlin, Aer Lingus and Air Serbia in Europe and is planning an introduction to Alitalia.The Swiss is worried about its long -distance business.In the Swiss aviation industry, almost 4,000 jobs are now dependent on capital from the Arab Emirates - a development that only used eight years ago.
At that time, the Swissair subsidiary SR Technics was sold to a consortium from the United Arab Emirates.Today, the aircraft maintenance company, which employs around 2400 people in Switzerland, belongs to 100 percent of the Mubadala Development Company, a state fund of the United Arab Emirates.2007, another Swiss company passed into Arabic property: the ground handling company Jet Aviation Handling AG, which in Zurichand Geneva employed around 1100 people.The company is now called Dnata Switzerland and belongs to the Emirates group based in Dubai.
And in addition to Darwin Airline, at which Etihad got on with 33.3 percent last November, the Basel parcel airline Farnair has also had a co -owner from the golf region: the Falcon Aviation Group based in Abu Dhabi.Jobs are now around a tenth of all jobs in the aviation industry in whole or in part in the hands of golf states.This is concerned about the umbrella organization of Swiss aviation, Aerosuisse: "If the framework conditions in Switzerland do not improve, there is a risk that jobs will be moved to Abu Dhabi or Dubai," says Claudio Lasagni, at Aerosuisse for aircraft maintenance and -Manufacturer responsible.
Andreas Wittmer, aviation expert at the University of St. Gallen, also sees the investments from the Middle East skeptically: “It is positive that donors will receive jobs from the Middle East in Europe.»Many of the companies bought out had little growth potential and would have been received for a long period of time.
"At the same time, however, dependencies are created that could be dangerous for asparagus," says the economist.The purchases in Europe are part of an industrial policy that has been operated by the Gulf States for several years.The goal is to become more independent of the oil export.
"The companies have to set up the time after the oil and invest in workplace -intensive industries such as tourism or airlines," says Jan Atteslander, head of the outside economy at Economiesuisse.For example, the most important traffic hub in the world is to be created in the Middle East, through which a large part of the long-haul flight traffic will be managed in the future."If you can reach 75 percent of the world's population in eight hours, one or the other company will consider moving their headquarters there," says Andreas Wittmer.
The airlines are supported politically and financially.Wittmer estimates that Airlines such as Etihad or Emirates have a cost advantage over the European airlines of at least 20 percent due to deeper tax rates, levies and wages.In addition, it can also be flown at night.
This has an effect: Between 2000 and 2012, the airlines in the Middle East have grown by 346 percent.Today they offer a product that even the Swiss says that it is "comparable, sometimes even better" than their, but at massive cheaper prices.
This is positive for Swissau's consumer perspective."But only as long as there is no dumping and the competition is not distorted," says Jan Atteslander and reminds that it was a tradition in Europe for decades to support state airlines.Andreas Wittmer warns that the Swiss looks at difficult times in the long-distance market without protectionism and that Switzerland's intercontinental connection could be adopted to a considerable part of the golf airlines.
"Then some sheikh will decide how the Swiss economy is networked with the world." According to experts, the golf airlines are only waiting to open new routes in Switzerland-for example Zurich-New York.Up to one year, it is now to be clarified as part of the new aviation policy report what the political attitude towards the Golf competition looks like.
"The question should be answered whether this airlines are only a threat to the Swiss aviation system or whether they also open up new opportunities," says Bazl spokesman Urs Holderegger.Arab Emirates investment: Darwin Airline became Etihad Regional.
Photo: Ennio Lanza (Keystone) Future of the aviation lace forecast at the University of St. Gallen, on behalf of the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL), have mapped the future of global aviation under the influence of golf airlines.And they paint a horror scenario.The development that is currently underway "inevitably" leads to ruinous competition, unless the cost of network expansion would be too great.
The result is a worldwide consolidation of the industry, according to which only around three airline groups remained.Four to five “mega hubs” will still exist in the scenario per continent.All other airports, including those who previously worked as hubs, take on a pure feed role.
Unlike their competitors, golf airlines do not have to operate profitably per se.Rather, they are part of a state strategy to make the golf region an international node for trade, traffic, communication and finance, as the researchers carry out.As the next steps of the Arab Airlines on the way to world domination, the St. Gallen researchers see the optimization of the connections between Europe and Asia and then the structure of lines between Europe and North America.
(Stü) Review by the Bundesamtabu Dhabi dictates the network of the former Ticino Airlinevon Mischa Stünzidia Arabic Aircling Society Etihad with its aggressive takeover policy, so strongly that not only the local airlines, but is now also queasy.
The Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) has therefore started an exam for whom Etihad Regional, the former Darwin Airline, actually heard and who is taking control of the airline.In technical jargon: ownership-and-control test.The EU Commission also recently announced that it took a close look at Etihad in Air Berlin.
The test can have far -reaching consequences.If the authorities come to the conclusion that Etihad Regional or Air Berlin are so strongly under Arabic that they can no longer be called Swiss or European airline, the loss of essential land rights or the withdrawal of the operating permit threatens."But that's just the Ultima Ratio," says Bazl spokesman Urs Holderegger.
Before that, you would look for the conversation and a mutual solution with the airline.There is certainly evidence that Etihad is in charge of her European partners.It is undisputed that the Arabs only have minority stake in the Occident.
However, this does not prevent them from holding the threads in their hands.It is obvious at Air Serbia, where Etihad has taken over management for the next five years.At Air Berlin and Etihad, the influence of Abu Dhabi manifests itself in the route network.
In its statement on the Bazl, the Swiss points out that the German cheap airline had set almost all connections to the Middle East shortly after the cooperation with Etihad announced.The old Darwin network is also noticeably adapted to the needs of the new partner.So numerous new flights to Geneva are put into the program.
Etihad also builds Regional Zurich as a new hub.Even the headquarters are to be moved from Ticino to the Limmatstadt.Background of the newly discovered love: The Arab mother house will fly from Zurich to Abu Dhabi every day from June.
Darwin has become an Etihad to the Zulerer.Their task is largely limited to bringing guests from all over Europe to the airports that are operated by the big brother.The fact that Etihad dictates the route network of the Swiss airline is not yet a reason to fall through the ownership-and-control test.
"If it is already, it must become clear that Etihad has legally under control over Darwin," says Holderegger from the Bazl.He does not want to carry out what this means in detail with a view to the ongoing procedure.However, he points out that the Bazl sees "no need for action".

One final resting place for the Dakota propeller / / "almost two years after the discovery of a propeller on the Gauligletscher has been determined, where the relic of an aircraft crash from 1946 is kept: in the village center of Innertkirchen. The main interest applies to the aircraft, which is still inIce rests.
Andrea Kucerader Dakota-Propeller, who unexpectedly reappeared in summer 2012 after 66 years, finally has a resting place: it is to be presented to the public in the village center of Innerkirchen in the Haslital in the canton of Bern.On June 17, the exhibition will be opened in the Grimseltor visitor and shopping center, says the Bernese cantonal archaeologist Daniel Gutscher on request.
With this location decision, an almost two -year period of uncertainty and haggling around the place of storage of the spectacular find ends.Media interest and joy in the Haslital were thanks to climate change when three young people came across the propeller of the American Dakota aircraft in the summer of 2012 on the Gauligletscher, which was one in 1946 with eight passengers on board meiringen in the iceSpectacular crash landing.The historic find is reminiscent of the first major recovery campaign in the Alps, which is the birth of the pilot rescue gilt:
The entire crew was weakened five days after the accident, but was flown well into the valley.The military aircraft itself stayed on the glacier and was swallowed off the ice over time.The fact that part of the Dakota reappeared over 60 years later is explained by climate change and the associated melting of the glacier.
The joy of the find soon followed perplexity: where should the propeller be kept and made accessible to tourists and locals?Not a simple question, especially since one day the rest of the aircraft or at least other parts of the ice will be released.The traffic center in Lucerne and the Alpine Museum in Bern also showed interest, the municipality of Innertkirchen, on the bottom of which the Gauligletscher is located, and the military airport Meiringen.
Last but not least, the hut manager of the Gaulihütte in the near proximity of the site wanted the propeller to be exhibited up there.Negotiations with all those interested were tough.The solution innerkirchen is now satisfied with all parties, says cantonal archaeologist Gutscher.
In the Haslital, one hopes that the propeller and its history become a central attraction in the region.In addition to the exhibition in the village, an information board for hikers is therefore attached to the edge of the glacier within sight of the site.Kerosene on the glacier The local mountain guides have jumped on the train and offer multi -day guided trekking "in the footsteps of the Dakota".
A visit is particularly recommended at the end of summer, when the glacier is saved, explains mountain guide Käthi Flühmann.She says sheet metal parts, seat springs and oily traces on the ice, she says.And from a glacier column it smelled suspiciously of kerosene last summer.

Swiss under growing competitive pressure / / The Swiss Air Foundation indicates growing challenges for the Lufthansa-Swiss team because of the strong airlines from the golf region.Nobody has simple recipes on hand.
Werner Enzdie out of baptism in 2005, upgraded by Swiss Air Foundation, which is presided by former Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger, is very concerned about the competitiveness of the Swiss in a longer-term perspective.The foundation, which has accompanied the takeover of Swiss by Lufthansa since the beginning and pursues the quality of the hub concept operated from Zurich in an independent monitoring, emphasizes in a press release that the competitive situation has changed drastically.If a sucking of traffic from Zurich through Frankfurt and Munich was feared eight years ago, there are now airports in the Gulf States (Dubai, Ad-Dauha and Abu Dhabi) and Istanbul, which drive worry lines onto the forehead.
Nothing in stone is accurate in stone the indication that the strong expansion of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways (but also by Turkish Airlines and other providers) makes the economic future not only appearing to be unsure about the Swiss, but of the entire European civil aviation.The weights are constantly moving, but that has always been the case in the global aviation industry in the past two or three decades.The hint of the aviation foundation - it formally lives on until 2015 - is somewhat nebulous - it is open whether the new market dynamics will also bring movement to the relationship between Lufthansa and Swiss.
What does this mean ?In retrospect, it can definitely be stated that the Swiss has been gorgeous as a 100%Lufthansa subsidiary.At least so far.
It was shown that the Swiss was able to preserve a certain independence thanks to the overall above-average performance in the Lufthansa Group Association.However, this is undermined if the corset at Zurich Airport is already strongly felled.The night flight ban is an obvious location disadvantage from Zurich, for example, Dubai;
This will remain a painful constant.Not only in Switzerland, but also in many places in Europe, you have maneuvered yourself with strict night flight regulations (keywords: German air traffic taxes; CO2 emission certificates of the EU) and an inferior air protection (single European Sky as an empty dream).
The global dimension of the business is not given the necessary attention.Unequal Spiessebundenrätin Doris Leuthard had said last February as part of a discussion forum organized by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) for the emerging competition of airlines from Asia and the Middle East.A certain balancing act was observed from her.
Switzerland as a hub carrier is under growing pressure, but on the other hand, new direct flights are expressly welcomed by and to Switzerland by other providers.The latter is thought consistently in the market economy and the former is an economic reality.The Swiss suffers disproportionately from the restrictive airport regime, although "Bern" must probably do more than the record that the expansion or an expansion of airports is difficult to enforce.
The Swiss described the difficult market situation quite SEC in a entry submitted to the Bazl.Without a moving passengers - also a Swiss organized feeder transport - only direct flights to New York, Tel Aviv, Bangkok, Dubai and Singapore would pay off.The airlines from the golf region have governments in the back that see air traffic as strategically important.
Swiss makes the claim that the strong expansion of the golf airlines is only possible thanks to direct or indirect state aid.The Swiss does not yet observe a strong negative effects on the utilization of its direct flights.In the medium term, transfer passengers from Europe would be missing because they would be served by Emirates and Co. directly from European airports.
In contrast, there is nothing wrong in a liberal air traffic market, which the Swiss also wants.Last but not least, the competition includes the risk of falling.In contrast, an Etihad is not immune.
Their expansion strategy in Europe is largely based on strong minority stake in poorly established airlines (Air Berlin, Air Serbia; Alitalia?), What awakened memories of the Hunter strategy of the Sairgroup.
Who can afford to burn money over years and without prospect of success?Participation of Etihad in Alitalia uncertained tzermia (tz) tz.
Rome · Two weeks ago, Italy's transport minister Lupi said that Etihad's significant participation in Alitalia was practically ready for signature and a formal offer from Abu Dhabi could be expected in one or two days.Even a “Letter of Intent” has failed to materialize to this day;
And on Wednesday, local newspapers reported that the negotiations between Etihad and Alitalia had suffered a setback and whose failure could no longer be excluded, which would again conjure up the risk of the Moribunden Alitalia for years.According to reports, Etihad has significantly tightened the conditions for the intended 40%participation, in a mass that fears that the emirate that the airline has could generally be smeared back before getting started.An Italian union leader, on the other hand, said that only the skirmishes that are common for the final phase of negotiations were currently taking place.
According to information from the “Corriere della Sera”, Etihad wants to put the approximately € 500 million for the 40%participation only into future projects and get rid of the contaminated sites as far as possible.The Arabs insisted on a restructuring of at least € 400 million debts, with total liabilities of over € 800 million.In addition, a reduction from 14,000 to 11,000 jobs and significant infrastructure services would be required, such as the development of Fiumicino Airport with high -speed trains.
Negotiations with Etihad began when Air France-Klm, the previous industrial partner of Alitalia, had refused to draw another capital increase of over € 500 million last November.This reduced the quota of the French-Dutch group from 25 % to 7 %, while the state post-group posted posts Italiane acquired a participation of 20 %.The Grossbanks Intesa Sanpaolo (20.6 %) and Unicredit (13 %) hold significant shares.

Leuenberger concern for Swiss / / Zurich - Alt Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger is worried about the Swiss.The Gulf State Airlines Etihad and Emirates questioned the future of the Swiss airline with their dumping prices.
"These airlines can offer deep prices that European companies cannot keep up," says Leuenberger (67).The former transport minister is President of the Swiss Aviation Foundation (SLS).She wakes up that the German parent company does not give the Swiss daughter starve and does not move the traffic to Germany.
"The danger," says Leuenberger, "today is no longer Frankfurt or Munich, but what works in the Gulf States.»The airlines there benefit from low fuel prices.And night flight ban is a foreign word anyway in Abu Dhabi.

The money for the controversial plan B would be ready / / If the voting people on May 18, no says to Gripen-Kampfjets, the army has more money available for investments.This fueled rumors that the Air Force received new jets despite no.
Federal Councilor Ueli Maurer himself heated them up.Defense Minister Ueli Maurer himself ensured that rumors are circulating through a plan B.In the March issue of the “General Swiss military magazine”, he underlined that eleven planes have to be rented in any case, even if the voting is said no to the Gripen Fund Act on May 18, but then for a long time ”.
Hosted reactions were not long in coming.The fact that Maurer wants to equip the army itself with new fighter aircraft, regardless of a folk, did not work well in the voting struggle.One or the other voice citizen could occur and acknowledge this statement with a protest.
A little later, the Defense Minister put into perspective and denied in an interview with the “Aargauer Zeitung”: In the event of a no, it must first be analyzed why the people rejected the jet.And: «Renting the gripes after a possible no is not up for debate.»
The manufacturer Saab also confirmed that there were no plans or agreements for a long-term rent from Gripen fight jets.Maurer's statements on this topic could also be interpreted somewhat pointed in such a way that the Air Force could rent a different fighter plane instead of the grip.Oil pour into the fire
Likewise Thomas Hurter, SVP National Councilor and President of the National Council Security Commission (SIK).In the Radio RTS western Switzerland, he proposed to finance the purchase of new fighter jets through the ordinary army budget.The result would be the same:
Regardless of a popularity, the Swiss Air Force came to new jets.Stagated, about a dozen every fifteen years.The defense department immediately distanced itself from the proposal of Maurer's party colleague.
Seductive Budgethinzu come further circles that spread rumors about comparable business games.The fact that such ideas are sprouting is due to the army budget that Hurter spoke to.This shows amounts that seduce.
The money that the army will be available in the coming years was preceded by a hard struggle between the government and parliament.In the 2010 army report, the Federal Council had fixed the army spending on the army of CHF 4.4 billion annually.Nevertheless, the parliament decided 5 billion.
Reluctantly and only gradually, the Federal Council gave in and finally steered CHF 5 billion from 2016.The government had already included the CHF 3.126 billion for the grip in the first variant.The fund, voting on the Swiss, is fed out of the army budget for eleven years.
The 2014 estimate already provides for a contribution to the gripen fund of CHF 342 million.The parliament ranks in the winter session what this amount should happen if the vocal people drops the grip.SP national councilor Barbara Gysi (SG) fought with a minority application that this money is no longer available to the army in the event of a no.
It failed.This means that the army could use the CHF 342 million for any investment if the grip does not take off.However, the political resistance is:
If Ueli Maurer still wants to start with a plan B at a people, he would encounter considerable political resistance.This underlines with Alex Kuprecht (SZ), President of the Standary Sik, another party colleague of the SVP Federal Council."It doesn't work that way, I would clearly reject it - a referendum may only be reversed by another referendum," he says, and thus appeals to the ideals of their own party.
He demands that the additional money have to be stuffed with a "gaps".By this means the renewal of outdated material such as vehicles.Perhaps even Kuprecht's plans would be thwarted.
Because the savings pressure on the entire federal budget will grow due to several projects.A large chunk is, for example, the corporate tax reform III, which should reduce the income by more than one billion francs in the federal government alone.As Parliamentarians report, Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf has already announced at a meeting of the finance commission that the CHF 5 billion for the army must be discussed again in a gripen-new one.
Bernhard Kisligle's television "Arena" although Federal Councilor Ueli Maurer cruelly in the program "Rundschau" a week ago about a Gripen contribution and even lost his content, he dares back to Leutschenbach.Today he defends the controversial procurement of 22 gripen fight jets on the “Arena” discussion program.
Also on the television debate take part: National Councilor Chantal Galladé (SP, ZH), Councilor Karin Keller-Sutter (FDP, SG) and the green-liberal National Councilor Roland Fischer (LU). Gripen EMIT Up to two Mach on the way22 Gripen ereinforce in the future.What is in the Swedes' fighter jet?
The Gripen E is a radiating multi -purpose fighting aircraft from the Swedish manufacturer Saab.This model is a single -seater.The two -seater variant Gripen F has been dispensed with because it is more expensive, no on -board cannon and a smaller fuel tank.
The Gripen E has a length of 15, 2 meters and a range of 8.6 meters and weighs a little over 16 tons.With a maximum thrust of 98 KN (this corresponds to about 85,000 hp), the fighter jet reaches a top speed of MACH 2 - at 20 degrees this would correspond to a speed of almost 2500 km / h.Gripen E has ten stations where weapons and fuel tanks can be attached.
This allows him to stay in the air in a typical air police configuration for two hours and 45 minutes.To date, over 80 percent of the new components have been tested with the Gripen-F demonstrator.Armasuisse are involved in the test work directly on site.
The final certification of the Gripen E is planned for 2018.In the same year, the first three fighter jets are to be delivered to Switzerland.In 2021, all 22 grips in Switzerland are to be on duty.
With the 22 gripen E to be procured, two seasons will then be formed from 2021.In the future, one of the three flying squadrons will only have one season F / A-18.Most fighter jets from the Gripen brand are flown in Sweden, namely their 96. The Swedish state recently signed an agreement to convert 60 gripen C into Gripen E.
Models of the Gripen series are already used in the following countries: South Africa (26), Czech Republic (14), Hungary (14) and Thailand (12).At the end of last year, Brazil ordered 36 latest gripen generation aircraft from the Swedes.
With that of the tiger, no more militia pilots will be used on Swiss fighter jets.The new weapons systems of the F / A-18 and Gripen E are far too complex.However, this also means that according to embassy 41 additional professional military pilots have to be employed.

MH370: New Spur / / Malaysia ·
The government in Kuala Lumpur pursues a new hint in the search for the missing airplane of the Malaysia Airlines.According to a report, an Australian company claims to have located the wreck of the machine in the Gulf of Bengal.The corresponding report was noted, said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein yesterday.
2014
MH 370: Search is changed / / almost two months after your disappearance There is no trace of the Boeing 777 of the Malaysia Airlines.
Now a month -long search is being prepared on the sea floor. "The search has to go into a new phase," said Australia's leadership and transport minister Warren Truss yesterday after a meeting with his counterparts from Malaysia and China in Canberra."This is about a more intensive search on the sea floor." The new strategy can cost up to $ 60 million in Australian dollars (just under CHF 49 million).The wreck of the Malaysia Airlines machine is suspected in a barely researched area of the Indian Ocean.
She disappeared on March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.In the suspected crash area, the sea floor has never been systematically mapped in places."In order to be able to search more and safely with sonar and other underwater vehicles in the next phase - possibly in particularly deep water - we have to know more about the sea floor," said Truss. "The search is not interrupted or set, we do not give upAnd do not let in our efforts, »promised the Chinese transport minister Yang Chuatang after the meeting.
China is very interested in investigating the mysterious straw because the majority of 239 people came on board from China.Malaysias Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein also took part in the meeting in Canberra.The unmanned submarine Bluefin-21 of the US Navy remains in use for another four weeks, as the coordination site for the search in Perth announced.
In 35 days it searched 400 square kilometers in a region about 1800 kilometers northwest of the city of Perth - without success.Extremely elaborate searches have had an enormous extent, TRUSS emphasized.«4 638370 square kilometers of ocean were searched, 334 search flights completed, the pilots spent 3137 hours in the air.»
29 aircraft and 14 ships were involved in the efforts.The aim of the search is to the Blackbox of the missing machine, in which the recordings of the conversations in the cockpit and technical data are stored.Investigators still have no idea what happened on board flight MH 370, why the contact broke off.
At the weekend it became known that eleven alleged members in Malaysia had been temporarily arrested.The authorities rejected speculation that they were arrested in connection with a possible terrorist attack on flight MH 370: "There is absolutely no connection," said Malaysia's chief General Khalid Bakar.Yesterday there was also displeasure with the Head of Relatives with the Chinese relatives of the missing passengers of the aircraft.
They had been housed in a hotel in Beijing in the past few weeks at the expense of Malaysia Airlines.Now they have been informed that they would have to clear these accommodations within three days."We should have given us more time to prepare us for it," said Steven Wang, whose mother was on the plane.

Emirates with a lot of thrust / / "The high -flyer Emirates invested another $ 6 billion in the expansion of the fleet last year. The expansion is continued without any ifs and buts.
The airline Emirates, based in Dubai, which has also served Zurich with an A-380 since the beginning of the year, had a lot of triggered in the financial year at the end of March.After a few weaknesses in the first half of the year, which did not surprise the struck expansion pace, significant yields were achieved in the second half of the year.The consolidated net profit subsequently jumped by 32 % to 4.08 billion in the year.
(or $ 1.1 billion).High-flying plans expired year 16 more A-380 and 8 B-777 and two freight aircraft (also B-777) came to the fleet.
The capacities were thus expanded by 15 % at an accelerated pace.The route network around the globe was spun even finer, with not always everything was rounded.So the timing was not ideal for opening the destination Kiev.
But thanks to the cooperation with Qantas, it was also possible to load the aircraft well.The degree of utilization of the fleet was kept approximately stable at 79.4 % compared to 79.7 % in the previous year.Sales and traffic growth also progressed with 13 % in step.
In the meantime, the fleet has grown to an impressive 134 B-777 and 47 A-380.As is known, a duplication is again sought with a time horizon of just over five years.At the Dubai flight show, it was announced last year to buy another 150 B-777 and 50 A-380 for almost $ 100 billion.
Even if the aviation is a growth industry par excellence, such high -flying plans could fail one day.A limited factor may be that the aggressive appearance of Etihad and Qatar Airways and other airlines from the Golfregion could soon present the competitive situation in a new light.In addition, in the next few years there will probably be the advancement of Turkish Airlines as well as Chinese and also Indian airlines, which cannot simply be dug up the water in their home markets.
Sheikh Ahmed, which leads the Emirates Group, not only said optimistic tones on the occasion of the presentation of the year.The company must remain agile and work even harder to continue to succeed in a competitive environment in the future.An inconspicuous number of numbers of Emirates Group belongs to the DNATA specializing in ground handling, which also laid down two -digit growth rates.
The number of employees increased by a seventh to 22,980 people, sales rose just as quickly to $ 2 billion.Dnata is an important component for Emirates to cement its positions around the world.The fuel consumption of Emirates increased by a tenth to $ 8.4 billion in the reporting year, which still used 39.2 (39.6)% of the total expenses for the expensive juice.
The second largest cost block was the personnel expenses with 13.1 (12.8)%.The expenses for the amortization of the aircraft expanded by a quarter (8.2 %).Little surprisingly, a whole bundle of financing instruments was used in order to implement the expansion, which is dizzying in the industry comparison.
Among other things, a variable-interest bond, which is guaranteed by the French export credit agency Coface, was placed on the market.Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed can present impressive numbers.Reuters the largest aircraft ordering year

Politics & Economy / / / on Tessin connection will be reworked (I) - after a long break, the construction work for the Ticino rail connection was resumed to Malpensa Airport on the Italian side.This was announced by Federal Councilor Doris Leuthard after a meeting with the Italian Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi in Milan.
Seco employees have been visiting for a long time-the seco department head, which is exposed due to suspicion of corruption, is obviously not a blank leaf.The man is said to have been targeted by financial control in the 1990s due to irregularities, reports the “Tages-Anzeiger”.The control authority asked for its transfer.

More passengers fly with Swisszürich - a good 1.4 million passengers flew with the Swiss airline in April.That is an increase of 3.1 percent compared to the previous year.The utilization of the seats has decreased slightly by 0.3 to 84.7 percent.
Takes over Nestlé Danone division?Paris- according to rumors, the French food and beverage company Danone is said to have discussions with the food giant Nestlé about the sale of business with a medical diet.The price should be CHF 3.7 billion.
The Bloomberg news agency reports.However, the sale could encounter resistance from the competition authorities.Construction industry needs foreign engineers- the engineering and planning industry is dependent on at least 800 foreign specialists a year.
This is reported by the Swiss Association of Consulting Engineering Droses and warned of the false implementation of the mass immigration initiative.The lack of engineering is still a big challenge in Switzerland.Retailing is set by three percent of Zwensburg - the retail trade was able to increase an adjusted increase in sales of three percent in March.
A plus of one percent resulted in February.Without fuels, growth was 3.1 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said.In the non-food area, sales even increased by four percent.

Riders who are missing the horses / / Since the end of the shuttle era, the need for astronauts has decreased sharply.At NASA, there are as few newcomers to training in the dream job as they have been in decades, some will never take off.
From Walter Jäggiwas do astronauts if you don't have a spaceship?The magazine of the Smithsonian Institution, the American guardian of the aerospace, recently asked the question.The youngest class in NASA's Astronaut School has been the smallest since 1969 with four women and four men.
The largest class with 44 participants started their training in 1996.Since 2011 the last US spaceshuttle flew into space, the possible uses of the astronauts have become rare.Until 2017 a new generation of space vehicles is available, there are only four flight options in Russian rockets for US staff.
Of the currently almost 50 trained NASA astronauts in the waiting position, only a few can hope to get on the train in the near future.It is not certain whether the budget and SICHERMEDEDIENS for the new American space vehicles can be observed in the period set.There are no open jobs at the European ESA only a few astronauts.
Ten are ready for use, six in training, with the 2009 class only the third in ESA history.There is currently no recruitment program.So is Astronaut a profession without a future?
The Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier sees it differently: «The need was always changing, depending on the programs.»There was also a gap between the end of the Apollo flights and the start of shuttle missions.
When the shuttles had high operation, there were six missions a year with a seven -member crew.Today the International Space Station (ISS) is operated by a handful of astronauts from different nations that stay there for months.Instead of a lively back and forth traffic of astronauts, the researchers' interest in the long-term starts today.
The United States is planning a landing on an asteroid in the twenties and a flight to Mars at some point from 2030. Claude Nicollier is optimistic about its successors that they will get the opportunity for missions.The astronauts are now being prepared for completely different flights than those for the ISS.
You train without knowing whether you will apply what you have learned in space.New spatial suits are being tested or tactics to enter an unknown asteroid that you do not know whether it is a loose rubble or a massive boulder.The NASA is already looking for a suitable asteroid.
Robots are supposed to steer the small celestial body onto a track on which astronauts can reach him.The skills of future travelers in space must be to endure in a confined space for a long time (candidates with experience in cave research are welcome in the selection).Cooperation between humans and robots will be very different than before.
In contrast to the shuttle or the ISS, only three astronauts travel together, there will not be one specialist for everything.The job becomes more versatile.The veterans in the industry do not doubt that a visit to an asteroid or on Mars is possible.
The necessary flight duration is physically created, says Elena Kondakova, who was the first woman on a long-term mission with a five-month commitment at the Russian Mir Station.So far, flights of 14 months have been mastered without any problems.The former cosmonautin today works at the Russian trade delegation in Bern, and she is the second Swiss spacecrator alongside Claude Nicollier, so to speak.
Kondakova and Nicollier recently took part in an event for the 30th anniversary of the CSEM (Center Suisse d ’électronique et de Microtech-Nique), whose president Nicollier is.The CSEM with several branches across the country is one of the numerous suppliers of the international space industry.Nicollier knows of his contacts that the Swiss precision industry is estimated in the industry.
At the ETH Lausanne, he himself gives lectures on how space missions are planned and carried out.It is neither about training astronauts nor about the construction of room stations.But "every engineer should have heard of space technology," says Nicollier.
In numerous Swiss companies there are references to spacebusiness.In the case of CSEM, too, innovations for space travel are always developed.Sometimes they can also be used for earthly purposes, as CSEM director Mario El-Khoury says.
With regard to future long -term flights in space, the automatic monitoring of the state of health of the astronauts is an issue.Sensors were developed on the CSEM that can be installed in the clothes and continuously monitor human vital functions.In ten or twenty years, astronauts are to be equipped with it.
The Zurich company Senscore, which emerged from the project, already offers sports dresses and software on Earth, with which top athletes can record and analyze data from your body.Ex-astronaut Claude Nicollier is also in an advisory committee of the young company S-3-Swiss Space Systems in Payerne.S-3 has serious plans to operate a kind of mini shuttle in the clock schedule from 2018.
The unmanned aircraft is to be brought to a large height of a carrier aircraft, start from there to space and later return to earth.Thanks to this procedure, placing satellites would be much cheaper than today.Claude Nicollier considers S-3's plans to be realistic.
Switzerland is not a nation of space travelers, but strongly integrating special knowledge from many international sources.S-3 have very good experts with current know-how, says Nicollier.Swiss know-how should be in the underwear for the trip to Mars in 20 years.

Success story of the Swiss “Connie” / / Met.·
At the time, numerous experts doubted the realizability of the dream of a group of aviation enthusiasts: one of the world's last flight-compatible Super Constellations from the USA to Switzerland and continued to operate here.Now it has been ten years ago that the vintage agent of all time, which is widely known as the most beautiful, classic cars arrived in Basel.
After an extensive restoration, 445 km / h, quick aircraft with its four piston engines flies around 70 hours a year in 1955- as a star guest of numerous flight shows at home and abroad.The HB-RSC “Star of Switzerland” sponsored by Breitling is operated by the Super Constellations Flyers Association (SCFA), which is domiciled in Basel, and which also offers its sightseeing flights against 3000 members.Difficulties with corrosion damage to the wings were also overcome, which in 2009 almost led to the definitive grounding of the once fastest transatlantic liner.

The crippling crash awakens new desires / / the no is also the starting signal for the bazaar for the free money-after all, over 3 billion.Leftists want to invest in education or the AHV, the bourgeops leave the money from the military.
Even the winners of yesterday's vote on the procurement of 22 fighter jets disagree.In particular, how the CHF 300 million should be used, which would have flowed into the Gripen funds annually in the next ten years.SP, Greens and the Swiss group without the army are convinced that the free tax billions do not belong to the army, but the population.
And the united left also knows exactly what the population wants, namely that this tax money is used for education, for public transport or for the AHV.It sounds very different from the bourgeois committee, which was against the procurement of the 22 grips.First of all, it was about developing the army, emphasizing the Green Liberal National Councilor Roland Fischer (LU) yesterday: "If this has been clarified, new fighter aircraft will definitely be a topic again." Satisfieda's bourgeois Pro Committee first fired a broad side against the media roar yesterdayaway .
The numerous surveys with negative trends and broad-stories have made the information and educational work heavily more difficult.Not a word of that many bourgeois politicians had a bad talk of the gripes for a very long time and that the ranks had only closed at the last moment.Now they are emphasizing of a security gap.
And leave no doubt that it can only be closed with modern aircraft.The representatives of the SVP, FDP and CVP do not want to know anything from solving the money from the army budget.Defense Minister Ueli Maurer hit the same notch yesterday and went one step further:
The closure of the security gap tend to cost more than the purchase of the grip.But how is it going now and which solutions are conceivable and likely?Outside the army: theoretically, this is possible, since it is in the voting book that the Federal Council and Parliament can decide on the use of the unused funds.
However, it is unlikely that the bourgeois -dominated parliament will meet this desire.This has shown yesterday's statements.Rent Gripen: Maurer emphasized that it was nonsensical to rent Gripen C / D now.
This is too expensive if you don't rely on a grip fleet later.Another model: Defense Minister also rejected desire for some bourgeois parliamentarians that you can quickly get a more potent plane, such as the Eurofighter.Whereabouts in the army budget:
Maurer left open yesterday, which was now happening with the CHF 300 million, which would have flowed from the army budget to the aircraft fund every year.He only found that this question would lead to violent discussions.Finally, many ideas are currently giving around: from the increase in the current willingness of the Air Force to 24 hours to investments in floor air weapons or in drone technology.
It is currently clear what is happening to the CHF 300 million for this year, which are now not needed for aircraft procurement.Because the army will not claim them because arms projects cannot be generated so quickly, they come to the so -called loan remains.They will be available to the military in the future, but only if it allows the federal financial situation.
When the bazaar will be closed is still completely open.Maurer wants to take the time for the analysis.Only then can the further procedure be decided.

New business card for the Saanen / / Saanen airfield · A modern hangar with a reception building and underground car park for 21 vehicles is to be built on the airfield.
But high -security databas also play a role.You cannot deny a certain charm for the Saanen airfield: the special dark brown tower and the gray Eternit-clad military hangar flank the 1400 meter long slope on the edge of the village with old half-round aircraft shelters and wooden barracks.
VIPs in particular appreciate the uncomplicated approach.But the old hangar cannot necessarily be described as a business card.The airfield cooperative currently publishes a building application that provides for a replacement building on which private airfield has been providing since 2011.
The wooden hangar - in the possession of the Armasuisse - is to be torn down and a new building for three to six area aircraft and helicopters is to be created in the same place.According to the plan, the hangar is designed on two Pilatus PC-12 and a Jet Ranger-machines that can often be found in Saanen.In the rear part of the building against the street, the reception area, sanitary facilities, accommodations, offices and two independent Operation Control Center are planned.
There are 21 vehicles in the underground car park.Two control centers are used by the airfield area, among other things, through private jets, helicopters, small aircraft, glider pilots, model pilots, for car training, polotary tournaments and agriculture.The airfield is operated by Air Sarina.
For information on the new building, the municipality is referred to the SIAG, which operates two underground and well -secured database in the Obersimmental and Saanenland.Their co -owner Christoph Oschwald explains the connection: «We have long been looking for a way to concentrate the maintenance and monitoring of our facilities.
The initiative for the new building started from us.For us, this means a significant strengthening of our locations in the Bernese Oberland.»In the Control Center, Siag customers will find finished jobs if you have to have access to your lost data and stored in one of the bunker systems.
The accommodations are also intended for maintenance technicians, as Oschwald confirms.More information is not available because the business with data backup - including that of the federal parliament and large corporations - is sensitive.«Basically, the project is an improvement in the airfield:
The ugly hangar is replaced by a pleasant, modern building.»The plans are available in the Saanen building administration until May 27th.The Federal Office for Civil Aviation is a mutual authority because it is an aviation law procedure.
With the exception of the disposal of asbestos -containing facade cladding and safety regulations during the construction phase, no requirements can be expected from the reports.Hans Rudolf SchneiderGV of the airfield cooperative through planned location of the water pumping station "The construction of a drinking water version planned by the municipality of Saanen in the eastern part of the airfield area continues to worry," said Walter Egger, President of the Gstaad-Saanenland airfield cooperative, at the meeting.
You still stand in the uncertain.«Of course, a water supply is important for the Saanenland.The location would simply be unhappy for us, »added Egger.
The planned location of a new water pumping station would be unhappy because the FGGs are flirting to modernize the airfield.For this purpose, the cooperative approved a planning loan over 100,000 francs on Tuesday evening."We can now tackle the project in detail," said the president about the decision and said at the same time:
“However, the probably forced construction of the drinking water version would be expected at unpleasant costs.We will keep an eye on that."" So that we can offer an airfield with sufficient potential for the Saanenland in the future, we all have to pull the same rope.
We want to advance the urgently required renovation and the expansion of the infrastructure, »said Walter Egger about the future intentions (see also main text).«We will no longer have air traffic, but improve the quality, because the no longer security -compliant aircraft shelters from the Second World War no longer meet today's requirements.As a result, no planes can be parked.
These will soon have to start again after landing.»According to an already developed preliminary study, this fact would be taken into account- corresponding new hangars would be integrated into the project, and there would even be fewer starting and landing flights.The FGS invoice is balanced.

Heaven so close / / the cliché of the pilot as a well -paid ray man who has a friend in every city is no longer in line with reality.Today the profession has many disadvantages.
Good offspring is therefore sought.Nothing indicates the accident that Urs Fiechter witness in a few hours.It is Sunday, Fiechter enjoys the sunrise in the morning silence before preparing for his working day.
He has been a pilot for over 25 years, and recently has been working for the Edelweiss.On December 26, 2004, Fiechter and his crew are in the Maldives.Your boat reaches the port at the same time as the Tsunami wave.
The team is very lucky, nothing happens to anyone.However, the airport is very destroyed.Eight long -haul flyers are ready for departure, 2500 passengers want to go home.
Fiechter learns from a second tidal wave that could exist and which is much stronger than the first.He decides to fly despite the chaos and the damage.He has his Airbus refueled and loaded.
The fully occupied machine starts ten hours later and ends up in Istanbul at night because the night flight lock applies in Zurich.Anyone can operate a PC flight simulator, says Fiechter.«However, there is only a good pilot.»
Fiechter knows what he is talking about, since he completed 16,000 flight hours.His Aviatic career began in the military in 1982, and since the late 1980s he has been flying as a line pilot.The big, gently man also works as a chief flight instructor.
He acts like a fatherly friend when he continues in a serious tone: «Today's generation thinks that it can undo all decisions with a key pressure as with the iPad.“Thanks to the fully automatic cockpits, flying has become easier than before, the common opinion was.The fact that this was a more fatal misconception would have proven accidents such as the crash of a French long -distance machine over the Atlantic, which is due to a lack of flying skills.
Those who mean to master everything have already made the first mistake, says the 54-year-old.The federal government will give money again at the beginning of her career, Nadine Hachen.The 27-year-old has been with Helvetic Airways for seven years, until recently she worked as a flight attendant.
Sometimes she was allowed to take a seat during starts or landings in the cockpit that the pilot profession fascinated her, says Hachen during a conversation on the Birrfeld airfield on the occasion of a media day organized by the Aeroclub in Switzerland.She completed her training as a private pilot and had her trained trains.For a few weeks now, the Aargauer has been a co-pilot at Helvetic Airways in Europe.
The training was very exhausting.She not only had to accept privation in time, but also a financial manner, because she covered the costs herself.Up to CHF 130,000 expensive is the way to the traffic pilot.
Pilot Fiechter remembers that around 2500 people wanted to attend the aircraft preschool in the 1980s.Today there are still several 100 applicants.Some airlines such as Swiss and soon also Edelweiss offer special loans in order to relieve the flight students at least financially.
High training costs without a guarantee on a subsequent employment are one reason why the pilot profession has become less attractive.By the mid -1990s, the federal government took part in the training costs of the Swissair pilot students.Again and again, demands for new federal support are loud in the industry.
In fact, the federal government wants to support prospective professional pilots financially again, says Urs Holderegger, head of communication at the Federal Office of Civil Aviation.From when the contributions are released and how high they are is still open.Actually, the funds should have been made available this year, but now the process is delayed, since the work on the regulation for the revision of the corresponding article in the Aviation Act also had to be extended to the education department.
Thanks to the support contribution, the aviatic training should generally be anchored more in the Swiss educational landscape."We also want to compensate for the dysbalance that exists compared to other academic training," explains Holderegger.In principle, the federal government not only wants to support professional pilots financially, other aviatic professions should also benefit from the funding.
Last but not least, the means should be a way to have good pilots on the market.From the perspective of Holderegger, there are no acute young problems.The number of traffic pilot licenses has been stable at just over 2000 for several years.
There are currently enough pilots available to the Swiss aviation.However, this is only thanks to the fact that staff from other European countries could be consulted.These EU pilots are just as well qualified as their Swiss colleagues, since the same training standard applies everywhere.
"The times when pilots sat in the cockpit, who spoke more badly than English, are over," says Holderegger.If the bilateral provisions changed and had to be increasingly accessed to the home market, it looks different: "Recruiting young pilot youngsters from your own power is not that easy." The reasons for this are complex and not just financial in nature.
On the one hand, the aftermath of the collapse of the Sairgroup and the associated Swissair grounding are still noticeable, say industry experts (see box).On the other hand, there are more airlines than before because, for example, cheap providers are involved in the market.Part of the Swiss staff also emerge to Asia to work for the golf carriers from Singapore or Dubai.
These companies often pay better than the European providers, but the pilot and possibly also his family must be willing to leave the Swiss home back for at least a few years.The reputation of the former "dream job" has also decreased because other professions can be earned more with fewer professions.Anyone who gets as a co-pilot starts an average of around CHF 5,500.
In addition, irregular working hours make leisure planning difficult.So why should someone become a pilot at all?There is a clear answer to that.
The “flight virus” is to blame: the interaction of nature and technology is still fascinated by pilots.Each crew forms a new work situation and requires a new team education.
If you are traveling together, work together in a confined space, have to find your way around in foreign countries, you conclude friendship faster.It is not uncommon for pilots to tell them that they have already met their groomsmen during their training.Therefore, it looks credible when pilot Nadine Hachen tells that she had never had any problems as a young, pretty woman and former flight attendant in a male domain.
On the contrary: her work colleagues even supported her, helped her with tips during the training and answered her many questions.You cannot imagine sitting in the office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m."I love my job, he inspires me every day," she says.
An enthusiasts of the search for this profession were involved in many enthusiasts, says Urs Holderegger.However, not all of the requirements for a pilot career met:
«There is not everyone to be responsible for an expensive machine and several hundred passengers.“This opinion is also Urs Fiechter:“ It needs people who expect the unexpected.»In addition to the flying skills, a very stable personality is also necessary.
Anyone who starts screaming because of a park bus is definitely in the wrong job."Being a pilot means taking responsibility and standing for his decisions." On December 26, 2004, Urs Fiechter introduced himself in the Maldives about the loudspeaker of an excited crowd.He announces to fly home.
At that moment he only thought about how the problem could be solved, says Fiechter in retrospect.It was only afterwards that he realized how serious the situation was back then, and only after the return did he process everything.Despite all the advantages and disadvantages, Fiechter is certain: "Flying is a dream job for those who exercise him." Young pilots are enthusiastic about aviatic as early as possible.
· The aviatic industry agreed that there are too little offspring for both professional and private pilots.This is also due to economic reasons, says Yves Burkhard, Secretary General of the Aeroclub in Switzerland.
The organization wants to counteract the deficiency with various projects.These include, among other things, a young pilot exchange program and an annual youth camp in the Engadine, where 14 to 16 year olds from all Swiss parts of the country should get to know the aviation.The aim of the activities is to arouse enthusiasm for aviatics.
Interested candidates can lead this path to SPhair, the formerly flying preschool.As an experienced pilot, Urs Fiechter knows how he has to react in difficult situations.At the beginning of her career, on the other hand, Nadine Hachen is, and recently flies as a co-pilot at Helvetic.

Satellite data for flight MH 370 published / / The Malaysian authorities have released data with which the last position of the lost aircraft was calculated.By Walter Jäggundians of the inmates of the Malaysia MH 370 flight.
Now the data has been published on which the authorities are based on the search for the machine.There are raw data from the contact attempts of a satellite with the plane, the crew of which no longer reported.Experts from the British satellite operator Inmarsat had evaluated the data recorded by the news satellite.
The relatives should be able to do little with the raw data.But they were concerned with the principle.And for transparency.
With the help of the data recorded, the experts calculated the time that needed the signals from the aircraft to satellites.Since the position of the satellite was known, there was a line of possible positions of the lost aircraft.The calculations were played through for different times and showed a flight path and a possible crash area somewhere in the Indian Ocean (see graphic).
So far nothing has been made there.This week, the Ocean Shield of the Australian Navy is also to end its search activities with an unmanned mini submarine.Chinese surveying ships will then explore the sea floor in the region, the coordination site of the search work in Australia said.
The seabed is to be scanned with sonard detectors that are drawn by ships.They deliver a kind of ultrasound images, on which hopefully wreckage parts will finally be recognized.It is questionable whether the now published Inmarsat satellite data will bring new knowledge.
The calculations have already been checked several times and apparently always gave a similar result.Inmarsat basically deals with the transmission of data and conversations.The fact that such a satellite was used for the location of an aircraft was new and first required the elaboration of arithmetic models.
The disappearance of MH 370 has started the flying industry.Plans for a complete monitoring of flights using satellites are now to be realized.So far, aircraft from air traffic control remained unreachable if you leave the supply area of the radar systems, i.e. over the sea or the polar zones.
Instead of the radar from below, the aircraft are tracked by satellites from above.This also has been proven above the sea.Flights in real time
Chasing new technology of airspace monitoring has already been mature, and the necessary devices are already available in many aircraft.The UN international organizations involved, the ITU telecommunications union and the ICAO aviation organization decided a few days ago to advance the introduction of satellite monitoring.
There are above all administrative problems to solve, for example a radio frequency must be reserved internationally for the service.Yesterday, the Secretary General of the UN Organization for Telecommunications said that skills symbolize top technology and was the safest means of transport.You have to mobilize all the forces together so that the aircraft could be followed anywhere in real time.
At an expert meeting in mid -May, detailed requests were also discussed with the new flight safety system with which the teachings from the MH 370 case are to be drawn.The so -called “global tracking” should automatically trigger the alarm in the future and send data to the ground when irregularities are found in a plane, such as a course deviation or a willful switch -off of security systems.It is also intended to use the satellites as a black box.
The data that is now stored on board should be sent to the ground control via satellite before an aircraft comes into a critical situation.Today, the black box has to be searched for after an accident, which is not always possible.In the future, you could call up from the satellite what the Blackbox registered last.

What we could afford for 800 million / / Bern-Ueli Maurer has to do without part of the Gripen money.After the no to the fighter jet, the Federal Council wants to provide a total of CHF 800 million of other departments.
For the purchase of the grip, funds were reserved in the current year and until 2016 - around CHF 300 million annually.BLICK shows what the departments could do with this amount.Minister of Education Alain Berset could immediately double the research funds of the National Fund.
So far, it spends almost CHF 800 million a year.Minister of Transport Doris Leuthard could settle the invoice for the new Axenstrasse between Brunnen SZ and Flüelen UR.Including two new tunnels, the project costs CHF 740 million.

The intellectual father of the city initiative / / by Martin Regenass Basel.Actually, he could fly a Swiss jumbojet today.
But Michael Wüthrich did not take the pilot's profession, the dream of every boy.Although the Green politician and Grand Councilor today completed the first single flight at the age of 16 and received the flight brevet with 18 thanks to the army flying.«But it wasn't quite enough for an insert in a jet jet.
I flew too badly for these speeds, »says the 54-year-old today.Nevertheless, the Swissair at the time asked whether he wanted to continue and become a line pilot.Wüthrich didn't want to.
The decisive factor was an experience in the house of a friend whose father was a line pilot.The father just came home and put the broom on the front door from one corner to the other.Wüthrich was startled whether this picture and it impressed him sustainably.
These are the side effects of pilot existence, his friend said, a fussy "everything has to be in the right place".In addition, a pilot is a kind of taxi driver who brings people from city to city."Taxi driver", says Wüthrich, "that's not my thing." Wüthrich studied physics and mathematics.
A few years later, computer science, geography and meteorology.Today he works 50 percent as an IT architect and deals with the development of security systems for the Internet, among other things.At the Leonhard high school, he teaches mathematics and computer science for half a day.
In the middle of the company, which Wüthrich chose for talking to the BAZ, students from Wüthrich and drink also sit coffee.Wüthrich greets her kindly with a wave.His face radiates gentle on the mutual courage in these moments.
That changes when it comes to politics and traffic.Then his eyes reveal a certain determination.Uncompromisingly in radiation back political opponents in the large
Wüthrich describes advice as "dark green", "extremist" or "for the president of the environmental, transport and energy commission too polarizing".That doesn't happen for no reason.Because where Wüthrich is involved in the development of laws, strict paragraphs come out.
So Wüthrich was in charge of the canton's energy system.Since then, industrial works (IWB) have only been able to produce renewable electricity.Private are also affected.
If a household needs a new hot water production, high-tech heating with significantly lower consumption is not good enough than 30 years ago.The law forces homeowners in the canton of Basel-Stadt to generate at least 50 percent of hot water production through renewable energies.This means investing in heat pumps, pellet heating or solar collectors on the roof.
"We have the sharpest energy law in Switzerland," says Wüthrich not without pride.Wüthrich could already be called uncompromisingly in the radiation limit values of cell phone antennas.If it was after him, the limit would be ten percent of the norms that are applicable today.
The network would then have big gaps, his opponents claim.«Put a mouse under an antenna for a while.She carries DNA damage of it, »says Michael Wüthrich.
He always carries his cell phone in a shoulder bag and advises against wearing a cell phone in the pantic.He uses headphones for short conversations.Criticism of the government councilor
Wesselswüthrich is also the spiritual father of the city initiative in Basel.In its original form, Wüthrich demanded that when it is elaborated, volunteers for the organization that car traffic in the city is reduced by 25 percent.The counter -proposal drawn up by him and the Grand Council, which the people agreed with almost 55 percent in autumn 2010, now provides for a reduction of ten percent by 2020.
The most radical of all solutions throughout Switzerland and Wüthrich says loosely from the sofa in the coffee hall: "From me it could also be 50 percent." Wüthrich recently headed to the headlines when he asked for the resignation of government councilor Hans-Peter Wessels (SP).This announced that it was unrealistic to reduce car traffic by ten percent by 2020.For Wüthrich this was the announcement of a personal defeat.
The surrender before the task of implementing the popular will.A blow against his political understanding. ”Apparently Wessels does not want to implement the reduction demanded by the people with measures that hurt the daily commuting drivers.Wessels wants to please everyone.
He shows leadership weakness on this question », says Wüthrich.A constitutional crisis is the same if the government does not implement laws adopted by the people.As a government council, Wüthrich would take the appropriate measures and he could be set up as a candidate if Wessels were to be ridden.
In Basel, a bourgeois domestic house grew up in a bourgeois house with a brother and two sisters.The mother faces an active liberal, the father of the forerunner of the SVP, the farmers' trade and citizen party.Cars were a matter of course.
But as it was not uncommon in bourgeois houses of the 1960s and 1970s, the children waved over to the left side.The high school season was formative for Wüthrich's politicization, and the autonomous youth center.«That had enormous influence on me.
I am a typical late 68.With just a few exceptions, they did not swing on a bourgeois course, those who were politically committed.»The foundations of his political attitudes were therefore laid.
But his career as a scientist is responsible for the extreme conviction for which Wüthrich stands today.That was in the late 1980s and early 1990s.After completing his second degree in computer science, geography and meteorology, Wüthrich was a leader in the field of radar meteorology for climate modeling.
With funds from the National Fund and the German Aerospace Agency, Wüthrich examined the influence of man on climate and global warming.It was about specifying climate models with environmental research modules that have been docked to the Russian space station and accommodated in the Laddleuke of the SASA spaces shuttle. «The thesis that people have a great complicity in the climate change could be demonstrated with the help of simulations“, Says Wüthrich.
This evidence has made sustainable impression on Wüthrich and explain his radical attitude.Dressed in jeans, shirt and 47 tailor -made shoes because of the size, Wüthrich takes a sip of his Gazosa raspberry.In terms of feeling, it belongs to the Rock ’n’? Roller.
You could just as well imagine him at the wheel of a Ford Mustang.Wüthrich says Ernst: «The basic tenor that people are complicit in climate change is certainly correct despite various counter -studies, and the correctness of the thesis is undisputed.Humanity will have a massive problem in 50 years if we continue to do so with resource consumption.
The children of our children are then affected. »To prevent this is the declared mission of Wüthrich.And he fights vehemently for this in the Grand Council and as President of the Environment, Transport and Energy Commission.He is considered a straightforward, emotional politician.
This is noticeable in the Grand Council when Wüthrich steps on the lectern and announces his opinion.He can get loud once, especially if things don't go as he would like.Mountains, Tango and Jazzwüthrich lives with his life partner in a family home on the Bruderholz.
His three daughters are grown up.The taste of music has changed from rock to jazz.He likes the pianist of Michael Wollny's World Commerce or Lars Danielsson.
As a greener, he is of course close to nature.So he is a ski tour guide and likes to climb mountains to "escape the tightness and give the thought a lot of space".He also dances with his partner Tango.
His hands could also belong to a craftsman.They are strong.Wüthrich recently felled and disassembled the sick plane tree in his garden with a colleague.
Firewood for the two wooden furnaces in his house.With that, however, not everything is the best.From 2000 watts or minergie, it is still a long way off with the 84-year building.
But the roof is energetically renovated, provided with solar thermal energy - and soon there will be photovoltaic cells on it.The basement ceiling will be renovated energetically this summer."I can save 20 percent of energy," says Wüthrich, who has a tour, a racing and a city bike in his garage- a car is consequently not in it.
With it and with train driving, the vegetarian does something for his ecological conscience and lives his conviction.He lets his gaze wander through the Hall of the Mitte company and says with Reue: «I probably have the most negative CO2 balance in here.

Etihad near to Alitalia / / (Reuters) · The Arab Air Society Etihad Airways is driving the planned participation in the battered Italian Alitalia.If the conditions were negotiated and the leadership and shareholders of Alitalia accepted them, the companies would bring the planned business to a conclusion, said Etihad and Alitalia on Sunday.
Etihad announced that she would explain the conditions in a letter to Alitalia.According to Alitalia President Roberto Colaninno, Etihad is the “ideal strategic partner” for the company.Italy's Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi expressed himself optimistically, this is important for Alitalia and Italy's air traffic.

Etihad drives participation in Alitalia / / The Arabic Airgoing Airgo Airways increases in the planned participation in the struck Italian Alitalia.If the conditions were negotiated and the board and the shareholders of Alitalia accepted them, the companies would bring the planned business to the end, said Etihad and Alitalia on Sunday.
Details were not given.Italy's Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi expressed himself optimistically and spoke of a "decisive day for our national airline".At the end of 2013, Etihad bought the Swiss regional company Darwin, which is now called Etihad regionally.
2014
Advantageous investments by Etihad in Switzerland / / Economists do not see any distortion of competition from the golf airline.From Andreas Valdaim November, the Golf Airline Etihad got into the regional market with a loan for the Ticino Darwin Airline.
In July, this will be converted into a participation of around 33.3 percent.A permit does not need it.Now the commitment under the Etihad brand is becoming regionally visible in the form of many advertisements and an almost unrivaled offer:
From Geneva to Rome you fly for CHF 59, from Zurich to Düsseldorf for CHF 73, from Zurich to Florence for CHF 80.Even Easyjet swallows empty, not to mention the Swiss.With such prices, she could not keep up and be existentially threatened in the long term.
Etihad's route network is still modest: from Zurich eight line flights, from Geneva eleven.But in combination with other European Etihad participations such as Air Berlin, Virgin / Delta, Alitalia and Air Serbia as well as the mother fleet with hubs from Geneva and Zurich, the golf airline could quickly become potent internal European providers and hard competitors in Asia.
Etihad and Swiss are about the same size with a similarly large network and a similarly large sales.But while the Swiss has to profit as a private company, Etihad belongs to the ruling family Al-Nahyan in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.The state airline was stamped out of the ground in 2003, at a time when the Swiss fought for survival, while the Etihad network expanded explosively thanks to Petrodollars.
Etihad Regional can operate much cheaper than the Lufthansa subsidiary thanks to very low capital costs (we are talking about interest-free subsidies), deep taxes and wages, and manages a distortion of competition that require political answers.«The more open and liberal a market, the more effective the instruments must be to prevent abuse of liberal order.In particular, state aid or dumping must be prevented effectively, »says Swiss.
On Tuesday, the Federal Council will have to comment on the question time.Deep prices promote welfare -leading national economists who questioned the TA do not see any distortions of competition.Because of the political context, most of them did not want to be led by names, but the St. Gallen University Reto Föllmi was quoted on behalf of St. Gallen.
He said that the desire of the Swiss had to be enjoyed with caution, because it comes from a competitor who feels pressed.A new, favorable offer in the flight market should be evaluated positively: «It lowers the prices for consumers and companies and indirectly increases the welfare of a country.»
The intervention of the state to protect a domestic company from foreign competition should be rejected at this stage.Only if the new player has a dominant position and dominates the competition from the market would it be the moment to intervene in terms of regulatory.With Etihad's investments, one is far from that.
Should Abu Dabi systematically subsidize her airline, Switzerland could sue Emirates before the World Free Trade Organization WTO.The rules are clear, but not as drastic as in the EU, where unauthorized government subsidies are sanctioned to companies.An example: many countries that are float of flight petrol (kerosene).
These subsidies are in the country itself and can hardly be combated via a WTO lawsuit because it is not export subsidies.A solo by Switzerland on the Etihad question therefore does not make any sense, says Föllmi."If so, Switzerland would have to work with the EU for a fair regulatory framework".
The first steps are obviously taken.The Uvek traffic department is "in contact with the countries affected by the same dossier, especially Germany and Italy," said a spokesman on request.New, very cheap competition: Etihad machines at Zurich Airport.

Air combat for Switzerland / / The dispute among the airlines has now even reached Federal Councilor Doris Leuthard.The Swiss and the Ticino: an endless story.
When the Swiss National Carrier in 2005-once again-withdrawn from Lugano-Agno Ti, he handed over the feeders from Lugano to Zurich to a hardly known mini airline called Darwin Airline.A year earlier, this was founded by investors in Ticino with CHF 100,000.Shortly afterwards, the Tessin Sergio Ermotti, today UBSchef, took part in Darwin and was the president of the Board of Directors until the beginning of 2012.
The flight business mostly remained deficient, and the Ticino was looking for a way out.So the Swiss came back into play.The Darwin shareholders offered her a strategic partnership or a financial participation.
But the Swiss did not enter these advances.Why, it said, should she take part in a deficit regional airline?Darwin later repeated the offer.
There was another basket.Also the proposal to do a common cause against the low-cost carrier Easyjet, for example through a common offer Geneva-Nizza (F), ignored the Swiss and, in turn, expanded its frequencies to the Côte d ’azur.In November 2013, Etihad Regional, the European regional airline of the Airline from the United Arab Emirates based in Abu Dhabi, becomes Regional, the European regional airline.
The Ticino investors had their way out: The heavyweight -financed heavyweight financed with Petrodollars had bought a capital increase with a third in Darwin and now expands them into a feeder for the parent company Etihad after the change of name.The old shareholders from Ticino waived their subscription rights and thus remained involved in two thirds - a Swiss majority of capital is necessary for reasons of concession.
Now there is a fire in the roof between Swiss and Etihad.In fact, the Swiss argue, Etihad controls the regional carrier and thus violate the license.Etihad Regional is more Swiss than the Lufthansa subsidiary Swiss, the opposite is tolerated.
The latest phrase published the “NZZ am Sonntag”: “UBS-Ermotti lobby for Etihad” with Transport Minister Doris Leuthard.Blick knows: The Uvek boss reported to Ermotti last May-not the other way around.
She wanted to know: Is the Swiss two -thirds majority still up to date?And: Wouldn't there have been local investors for Darwin instead of Etihad?In response, the Federal Councilor received a yes and a no.
René Lüchingerein yes, a no: Doris Leuthard.Etihad Regional, Swiss:
2014
Hardly any political scope / / René Lüchinger chief editore.luechinger@ringier.chda brews something together in the European sky.Etihad, the airline from the Emirates, today still with Swiss, blows a major attack.
123 new pilots have been ordered by 2020.A third of the second largest German airline, Air Berlin, already belongs to Etihad;Participation in Alitalia has been announced.
The Emir of Abu Dhabi wants to expand his home airport into a global turnstile, and the Swiss Etihad region should serve as a supplier.A master plan for the future after the oil.For the Swiss, this can be threatening to exist.
It is not for nothing that Transport Minister Doris Leuthard should provide information before the National Council as to whether golf state airlines like Etihad threaten Swiss aviation and at most there is a need for action.Let's not do anything: the political scope is extremely low.

Slaughtered and scrapped / / If an aircraft has landed in Teruel, it will never be the most likelihood.In the Spanish small town, a former military airfield is to become the largest aircraft cemetery of all over Europe.
A long slope, parking spaces for more than 200 traffic machines up to the A380, hangars and warehouses are ready, the first aircraft have already been victims of wrenches, saws and dividing discs.The main company at the industrial venue, which has practically no passengers, is a service and recycling company in which, among other things, the Airbus Group and the engine manufacturer Snecma are involved.The company is already leading a first system of this kind at Lourdes' world-famous Pyrenees pilgrimage.
However, the space there is limited, while the demand for aircraft scraps is increasing.Five times to the moon and back in the airlines in the world, 20,000 jets are on duty, up to 1000 per year should reach the end of their career in the near future.The average age of the extra service is around 27 years.
Some are on the move for 40 or more years until they are discarded, on the other hand there are more and more cases that come to demolition at less than 20 years.The kerosae costs are now 50 percent of the effort among large -scale planes, ten years ago it was 25 percent.The airlines prefer to use economical new machines that still make a better impression on the passengers.
Within 25 years, a transport aircraft collects as many miles as it corresponds to the route from the earth to the moon and back.For the owners of the aircraft, often leasing companies, the question arises whether an older type of revisions are still worthwhile.Only a low leasing fee is left for keros -thirsty old models.
Instead of investing millions, the owners prefer to sell their old machines.Some aircraft are used again as occasions, others are exploited and scrapped.But first they are parked for a certain time.
So that you do not set a rust, the parking field must be in a dry region, in the steppe or desert climate, in the USA, for example in California or Arizona.In the Spanish Teruel, 900 meters above sea level, the climate is also very dry, the sun shines in the region 242 days a year.Scissors for the aircraft covers
Airplanes are parked and checked, maybe another buyer can be found.If not, the valuable system components are carefully expanded, controlled, documented, labeled and packed in air cushion film.In contrast to the car industry, the use of used and revised parts in aviation is quite common.
The most valuable are the engines, especially if they had only been waited recently.Electronic and electrical components, chassis parts, seats, rescue equipment and much others can also be sold.If the aircraft cover is empty, the large scissors are used, the rest is scrap metal, glass and plastic.

Swiss promotes almost 18 million passengers / / msf in 2018.·
The Swiss exceeded its previous passenger record in 2018.The airline has brought almost 18 million passengers to their destination, which means 6 % increase compared to the previous year.With around 145,000 flights, the Swiss carried out 3.5 % more, with the growth mainly taking place in European traffic (+3.9 %).
The vast majority of flights, namely 127,000, were also carried out in Europe.Around 18,300 flights (+0.6 %) were on the intercontinental traffic.The Swiss has improved its utilization.
At 83.4 %, the seat load factor was one percentage point higher than in the previous year.It was more mixed in the freight business at Swiss World Cargo.There, the volume freight load factor was reduced to 78.9 % ( - 1.2 pp), while sold freight tonnen kilometers rose by 0.8 %.

Basel's problems with Manchester / / from Kurt Tschanbasel.Airhelp, a company that deals with passenger rights, analyzed the 50 European flight routes with the most delays and failures last year.
With the most unpunctual airports, the EuroAirport is figurative in the first half - in 20th place.Two out of three flights (62.3 percent) on the Basel -Manchester street were unpunctual."Of course we are not satisfied," says EAP spokeswoman Vivienne Gaskell.
However, the reasons for this were outside the control of the EuroAirport.The cause of the delays between the Rhine knee and the British island are rotating delays.In the specific case, the plane accumulates delays during the day.
According to the Gaskell, delays also arise because of bad weather.In the event of a storm, the aircraft had to fly around the thunderstorm and lose time for security reasons or have to fly later because thunderstorms are on the move or predicted at the arrival place.Another factor that cannot be influenced by the airport is the later slot coordination because there is a reduced capacity in the ATC control centers.
"Due to a lack of ATC personnel or strikes, the air traffic controllers can only deal with a certain number of flights per hour," emphasizes Gaskell.Finally, technical problems on the aircraft could also be the cause of the delays.Airhelp is an international company that has arisen from a start-up.
It helps travelers to claim their passenger rights and enforce claims for compensation.Since its foundation in 2013, the company has evaluated and enforced claims for claims of more than CHF 940 million.In addition, Airhelp has so far been able to help more than seven million passengers worldwide.
Checking the claim for compensation for the customer is free of charge.A service fee is calculated in the successful implementation.Geneva and Zurich
Better village not exactly in charter traffic, with direct connections, a better balance can be expected?"No," replies Gaskell.The reasons for delays have any type of traffic - both charter and line.
Geneva corin and Zurich clot cut off much better than the EuroAirport.You do not have a comparable problem route and do not figure in the ranking of the 50 most unpunctual.According to Gaskell, this does not mean anything.
It was also not legitimate to speak that flights from these state airports are more punctual."The Airhelp data relate to individual routes and are based on customer complaints and not on an overall overview of the delay statistics of Eurocontrol," she says.Only “minimal” feedback. Two out of three planes on the route
Basel -Manchester does not land or start, there would only be "minimal" feedback from dissatisfied customers.She does not call your own improvement opportunities to eliminate the grievance."This is mainly a task of air traffic control or aviation authorities, even at European level," she says.
The Mykonos-London Gatwick route figures on first place in Airhelp's flight delay ranking.Here three out of four aircraft do not end up at the planned time (75.2 percent).The routes Lisbon-Rom-Ciampino (74.3 percent) and Lisbon-Brussels-Charleroi 74 percent) follow in the other places.

Eye in the eye with the danger / / Anian Heierlidie Bergler in the canton of Uri learn from an early age:
Nature forces cannot be controlled.You can only try to assess them correctly.This is currently happening continuously.
Thanks to regular educational flights, specialists get an idea of the avalanche risk.There is an immense responsibility on her shoulders.You decide which traffic routes are blocked for safety.
There is a view when the helicopter at the Gotthard massif rises yesterday.Pilot Simon Baumgartner (32) has the joystick firmly in his hand.The rotor booms, the wind blows, and snow whips through the air.
The Swiss Helicopter machine flies rapidly via Andermatt towards Schöllenenschlucht.Snow lies on the steep rock slopes.From a bird's eye view it becomes clear why the main road, which meanders deep down through the rock, was still closed until Tuesday.
You shouldn't imagine what happens if an avalanche thundered on the heavily frequented route.The situation has been a bit relaxed since the weekend, but is still serious.Half level 3 (“considerable”) applies around Andermatt.
This means that spontaneous departures are occasionally possible.Avalanche expert and mountain guide Toni Niffeler (53) supports the canton of Uri in assessing the situation.He explains on request:
«It has had strong winds in the past few days.Together with the snowfalls, there were large deposits in higher regions. »With the help of the helicopter flights, the specialists see these snow warehouse.They are also based on so -called pointer avalanches.
"We see if there was exits in a certain place," says Niffeler.Because: "From this we conclude which hanging there is another risk." The experts rely on years of experience.You know the mountains and lead a register in which the avalanches are drawn.
Niffeler: «Predictions are never easy.You have to weigh evidence against each other.»
The calculation of the amount of snow is difficult.At the moment there are more dusty avalanches due to the warm temperatures.During your tours you rely on the aviation skill by pilot Baumgartner and companion Richard Herger (29).
The team of two is currently on one of numerous educational flights.When the helicopter leaves the Schöllen Gorge and controls it into Meiental, traces of large avalanches come to light on the southwestern flank of the mountain.The trains pass a few meters past alpine tongues.
It has protective buildings everywhere on the mountain."They are just filled up," says Herger.You can only see this up here.
In fact, when Baumgartner swings up and the base flies into Erstfeld, the white areas give way green meadows.In the Uri valley floor it looks more like spring.Pilot Baumgartner is highly concentrated until after landing.
"In winter there is sometimes diffuse light and poor visibility," he says.You have to pay particular attention to this.Nevertheless, he is not afraid:
«That would be wrong.But respect is needed before flying and nature! »From a bird's perspective, the nature of nature becomes tangible.The experts always look for possible dangers.

EuroAirport doubles capacity / / from Kurt Tschanbasel.
For the first time, the EuroAirport will crack the nine million passengers this year.The requirement is realistic because the airport managers around director Matthias Suhr only calculate with an increase of 4.4 percent.In 2018, growth was still 8.7 percent.
The fear of a hard Brexit, but also the impending trade war between the United States and China dampen the flight.A total of 8.6 million travelers who lifted from Basel to one of the approximately 100 destinations were removed last year. «An airport that was built on the basis of the Crossair, which has long since disappeared from the sky is not enough today and future requirementsMore, »said Suhr yesterday on request.In 2003, 2.5 million passengers were counted at Basel-Mulhouse Airport.
The airport director estimates the total investment for the next six years on a quarter billion euros.The total area is to be expanded by almost a third from 100,000 to 130,000 square meters.Around 30 million euros will be invested in the next three years.
The deputy airport director, Frédéric Velter, described the renewal of the arrival area, the replacement of the luggage tapes and the construction of four additional gates yesterday.With an improvement in the terminal infrastructure, waiting times are to be broken down.The airport relies on "modular expansion concepts".
This is to commission a general planner who is currently being sought.Up to 15 million passenger leather massive expansion takes place with a view to future developments in passenger traffic."We expect scenarios of 12 and 15 million passengers annually," said Suhr.
In the best case, today's airport is able to make ten million passengers.Another construction site is also the rail connection for the EAP.After this has become criticized on the Swiss side, the airport managers have adapted their vocabulary.
You now speak of a "necessary element of the two regional railways" in northwestern Switzerland and Alsace.It is about an expansion and optimization of the Trinational S-Bahn of the Agglo Basel and the Ter Grand Est.However, no significant increase in the number of passengers can be expected.
These should only increase by four percent due to the rail connection.However, rail connections improve public transport as a whole and is ultimately also a profit for the around 6,000 airport employees.The French state railways as the client rely on regional train traffic.
"A TGV will definitely not stop at the EuroAirport," emphasized Suhr.This year, a preliminary project study of over five million euros is to be spoken.First, however, one waits for a report by the French Ministry of Transport, which should clarify the schedule for the 250 million euro project and clarify the financing in detail.
The airport with its noise critics is difficult.Suhr emphasized that one of the goals postulated in the noise provision could not be achieved by the end of the year.Due to the accumulation of delays in the aircraft rotations, there was even an increase of 16 percent between 11 p.m. and midnight in 2018.
The number of flight movements was reduced.However, delays would have more than "eaten up" of this positive trend.Suhr strives for "a balanced approach" as it applies to all EU airports.
By 2020, he also wants to have a "limiting noise curve" decided by the aviation authorities of France and Switzerland."Then we know how much noise we can make," said the Basel airport director.London in front of Berlin and Amsterdambasel.
In 2018, too, the British capital London was the favorite destination for Basler.A total of 735 247 passengers were counted.However, this was only slightly less than in the previous year (+0.3 percent).
Berlin, number two after the bankruptcy of Air Berlin, was even in the downward trend.A total of 430 942 travelers were counted ( - 1.7 percent).The German capital is likely to make up the ground again in 2019, because according to the airport director Matthias Suhr, Tegel will also be flew.
After London and Berlin, Amsterdam and Palma follow the top 10 destinations before Barcelona.Istanbul (+12.5 percent) has made a huge leap forward and newly figures in sixth place.Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is the high -flyer among the most popular travel destinations with an increase of 19.4 percent.
New destinations are Bodrum and Luxor.There are more charter flights to Antalya, Heraklion, Hurghada and Olbia.The British low -cost airline Easyjet is still the undisputed number 1 at the EuroaiPort.
Thanks to an additional two new aircraft, the number of travelers has increased by 7.5 percent to around five million passengers.The market share was 58.5 percent.Airlines is a high -flyer at Wiz Air.
The Hungarian cheap airline is in second place with a market share of 7.2 percent.With 616 641 passengers, she placed an increase of 37.8 percent compared to the previous year.Lufthansa (+4.2 percent), Tuifly (+3.7 percent) and British Airways (+3.3 percent) will follow in the next places.
With the trend towards larger aircraft, this means that the number of flight movements has grown less strongly than in the past.It was 95 271 (+1.7 percent).The freight remains a problem child.
The full freight business closed with a minus of 9.9 percent.The proportion of air freight replacement by truck fell by half a percent.Only the express freight developed positively (+0.5 percent).

Airport is arming the Zurich cantonal police against drones on / / flight safety, the airport, Swiss and Skyguide at Zurich Airport yesterday decided that Kloten needs additional protective measures against drones.
The small flight objects are a great danger for commercial aircraft.In the past few weeks, the London airports have had to hire their business several times due to drone sightings.There have also been incidents at Kloten Airport.
The Zurich cantonal police do not reveal exactly how the airport wants to protect itself for tactical reasons.There are no simple solutions in this area.It is a arms race between providers of defense solutions and drone attackers.
Simply shooting the drone out of heaven is usually too dangerous.Davide Scaramuzza, professor at the University of Zurich and drone specialist, knows the various possibilities of protecting yourself from drones.Even birds of prey can be used.

Airport builds drone protection from / / flight safety The collision with a drone can be fatal for an aircraft.
After the incidents in Great Britain, Zurich Airport is also investing in better protective measures.Technically, this is a challenge.Alexandra Bröhmein gap gap in the wing of the aircraft.
The drone had disappeared there, the wing had swallowed it almost completely after the collision.It was therefore not only damaged by the aircraft's cover, but important parts inside.A few months ago, researchers from the US University of Dayton showed with an experiment which devastating consequences can have a collision between drones and transport aircraft.
The drone in the experiment was just under a kilogram.But the flight objects can cause worse damage than birds because of their hard shell.And transport aircraft can fly alternative maneuvers.
Before Christmas and early January, various drone sightings at the London airports Gatwick and Heathrow caused excitement.Gatwick Airport hired its company for several days.In Switzerland, too, there was a collision between a drone and a helicopter in the Verzascatal last year.
Those responsible at Zurich Airport therefore decided yesterday to expand their protective measures.In the past few weeks, the cantonal police, Flughafen AG, Skyguide and the Swiss have jointly carried out a risk analysis."In the course of the year, we want to examine various measures for drone tendency and security," says Stefan Oberlin, spokesman for the Zurich cantonal police.
The cantonal police are responsible for security in Kloten.There have also been incidents with drones at Zurich Airport.It is not easy for airports to protect yourself against the mini aircraft.
The drones are usually too small to see them on the radar screen.For tactical reasons, the cantonal police do not reveal the measures to be used in Kloten.A flight ban for drones over 500 grams of weight applies to a radius of five kilometers around the airports in Switzerland.
In this area, flights are only possible with a special permit from the control authorities such as Skyguide.If you still control your drone into the prohibition zone, you face buses or even prison terms.Clever methods to confuse drones gives various methods of how a drone can be taken out of heaven.
The military is also promoting research in this area.As often with such questions, it is a technical race between attackers and defenders."Almost every measure can be avoided with the appropriate skills and equipment," says Davide Scaramuzza, drone expert and professor of robotics at the University of Zurich.
With his team, Scaramuzza develops drones with his team that can move autonomously with the help of a camera.One of the anti-urban techniques aims at the GPS signal, using its drones.This technique is particularly suitable for drones that are autonomous.
The so-called GPS spoofing confuses the GPS receiver of the drone that you want to stop.The drone then incorrectly calculates its current position, and she also believes that the transmitter of the Spoof signal is now controling it.This enables him to take control of the drone, maneuver them from the danger zone.
For example, the US start-up Sky Safe develops such a solution.The spoofing device is a square box with several antennas from which the operators send the confusing signal.However, this only depends if the connection is possible in a straight line.
Drones that a pilot controls with a remote control can be forced to the ground with the help of radio jamming.A misery bothered the communication between drone and remote control with a stronger signal.The drone loses contact with the floor, the misery takes control.
The Jammer sends a strong signal, for example 178 watts, on the same frequency on which the remote control transmits its commands.Such interference signals can travel up to 10 kilometers.After the incidents, British media speculated that Gatwick Airport is now using an Israeli solution.
The drone dome technology works, among other things, with radio jamming.Drones with built -in security system Many drones that can be bought in Switzerland have already installed certain security measures.With the help of geofencing, the drone is programmed so that it does not work in flight ban zones.
However, it is possible to chop this geofencing and still fly.Not only interference signals, animals are also used in the fight against the drones.Birds of prey and eagles are very successful in getting flying objects from the sky.
The Dutch police tested the use of eagles two years ago, but gave up the project because the eagles were too idiosyncratic and the dressage would have taken too much time.The police of the canton of Geneva bought two young eagles almost a year ago, who are supposed to learn how to hunt drones.The project is still running.
On request, the Geneva police do not want to reveal how far the dressage of the eagles has now progressed.Sagitters can also shoot drones from the sky, but because of the risk of cross rackets, this is a risky practice.Various providers have developed weapons that shoot nets to capture the drones.
However, this is a maximum of 100 meters at most, which, for example, would not have helped in Gatwick.To date, the London police have not been able to identify the perpetrators.Every time she approached the drone, she disappeared.
In other countries such as the USA, drone owners must register their flight objects from a low weight with the authorities.In Switzerland, this only applies to commercial flights and devices over 30 kilograms of weight."It would also make sense for us to introduce a registration obligation for all drones from a weight of 250 or 500 grams," says Christian Schubert from the Federal Office for Civil Aviation.
From next year this will probably be mandatory anyway.The European Air Security Agency (EASA) is planning a new law that requires registration.In the area of flight safety, Switzerland automatically takes over the EASA rules.
In order to better regulate Swiss airspace in the future, air traffic control Skyguide will also start a pioneering project in Europe in June.It is called U-Space.Drone pilots should register their flights in the future so that everyone can get past each other better in the full Swiss airspace.
"In the beginning, this happens on a voluntary basis," says Vladi Barrosa from the air traffic control Skyguide.If you have a drone, you can register with a ID number, the mobile phone number and the drone series number in the system.The Airap app belongs to U-Space.
If someone wants to fly from A to B, they register the flight via the app.At the same time, he also gets warnings through the system when, for example, a Rega helicopter is on the road and the drone has to leave the intended route immediately.Zones with restrictions for drone flight farms

Everything ready for the "Davos Class" / / Andreas Ernst, Davosbahnhof, Davos Dorf.The cold is biting despite the bright sun.
Through the blue sky, two army -hedicopters leisurely pull along the flank of the white fluid to the Flüelatal.The bus is a long time coming.Two cheerful employees shuffle the meter -high snow from the canopy of the Hotel Rixo.
The traffic flows tough, but it flows.Finally, the bus comes with a few minutes delay and winds through the construction sites on the promenade."No problem," says the Serbian chauffeur, "it was much worse last year.
Big circus! »Tarzisius Caviezel, the Davos Landammann, is relieved that the construction for the major event is better forward this year.He is not surprised."We learned from chaos and drawn the right conclusions," says the 64-year-old FDP politician.
He receives a place in Davos in the beautiful old town hall in his office.The walls are bold, and there is a large portrait with three women opposite the desk."A Kirchner, original," says Caviezel proudly, "A loan from the museum." Regime is financed by Trump's visit, it was the traffic collapse that made the most headlines last year.
It had already started to build up the many pavilions when trucks clogged the main traffic axis of the promenade.This year, every pavilion operator and every shop that was prepared for advertising and encounters had to submit an application.The trucks receive a time window for unloading the building material.
Then they have to disappear.All of this is subject to a fee for the 150 applicants."The new regime is financed according to the cause principle," says Caviezel.
There is construction on the promenade like crazy.Thöny, the Biedere fashion business, cleared his range and made room for a country pavilion: "Poland - The Can Do Nation" is on the big advertisement.A few hundred meters further, the Café Schneider turned into a “Russian House”.
The red and white facade suddenly acts like Russian home style.And somewhere between the Russians and the Poles - as in real life - the Ukrainians at their restaurant.In recent years, quite a few business premises have been abandoned on the promenade.
The dark, dusty shop windows are a sight that is difficult to get used to.Crisis of the retail trade, it says.But now these local are completely occupied.
You advertise with chic expenses and cool installations for banks or consulting companies.Locals are a thorn in the side of this business model: a week rental during the WEF brings more than sales throughout the year.
So you leave the shop bold except for a week of January.The WEF organizers don't like to see that either.«Davos has to take care of his‹ ecosystem ›.
His reputation depends on it, »says Alois Zwinggi, member of the foundation management of the WEF. The infrastructure holds stand tastle The price is also the price drivers for accommodation of the guests.The “Financial Times” (“FT”), the body blade of many WEF participants, reports of a few fashionable hotels, which astronomical prices demand during the occasion.The Hotel Derby, which demands 7,500 euros for three nights in a double room, is notorious.
Is the breakfast included?Both the landlord and the WEF organizer agree that such usury prices are not the rule."There are always the same five houses," says Caviezel, "who fall out of the frame.»
And according to Zwinggi, private landlords are sometimes excessive.Foreign brokers were often also enriched as a middleman.Davos has 12,500 inhabitants.
With the WEF, the number increases by 17,000 people.Is that manageable for the place?"No problem," says Caviezel.
On beautiful winter days in the high season, when all 5800 second apartments are occupied and the hotels full, 60,000 people lived in Davos.«Our infrastructure is built for this.And finally, he adds with a smile, «we besides the WEF completely different, for example, the yodelling festival with 145,000 visitors.»
Certainly: the WEF is not a sugar slack for Davos, but the locals want to keep it.In September, in a vote with 63 percent yes votes, they approved a million dollar loan as a contribution to the security costs."It was a plebiscite for the WEF," says Caviezel.
Davos was a health resort known in Europe before the WEF has made it global destination in the past few decades.After the Chinese party leader paid his visit to WEF last January, the number of guests from China is now increasing.The advertising that the event for the Davos location means is priceless, says Caviezel.
"When Trump comes, there are headlines worldwide, and if he doesn't come." Limousins under the way back from Davos Platz to Davos Dorf are the red trains of the Rhaetian Railway a good alternative to the bus.They still run at long intervals.But from Tuesday the Züglein will become the inner-city S-Bahn.
It runs four to five times an hour with an additional stop at the congress center.The journey is free, just like the rest of the public transport in the coming days.That should take some traffic off the street.
Nobody believes in Davos that the passengers of the 2500 limousines can be seduced from the offer to change.But then they are at least among themselves in the traffic jam.The organizers open the doors on Tuesday around 3000 participants from all over the world.

"Formula 1 will soon no longer exist" / / Nico Rosberg (33) is now a business partner of SBB.At least indirectly.
The German-Finne, who gave the completely surprising resignation in 2016 just five days after winning the world championship title in Formula 1, is involved in the German start-up Lilium.This builds drones that promote people and has signed a declaration of intent to cooperate with the federal railways (Blick reported).Lilium drones are supposed to fly SBB passengers from and to the train station. "Oh, I didn't even know that the SBB is now there," says Rosberg, as a look at him.
The conversation will take place on Wednesday morning in the golf club, where the UN has rented for the doctorate of its sustainability goals.Rosberg gave a speech at seven in the morning, now he has half an hour.«For me, the WEF is a great marathon of appointments, which is really fun.»
He eats a Pain au chocolat, orders a yogurt.Rosberg is now an investor.Not just any, but a green one.
"I probably ran the farthest in the WEF in the WEF," he says.By this he thinks that he has had a career in racing, thousands of kilometers have driven with internal combustion engines.«But now I'm doing everything well again, I fight back.»
If you make mobility greener, you can do a lot.Rosberg not only invested in Lilium, but also in Formula E, the electrical racing series.What comes faster, Nico: that Formula E is more popular than Formula 1 or that a drone taxi from Lilium flies to the train? «Formula 1 will not be long in this form anyway.»
It will join Formula E.«It cannot be that in a few years the whole world is traveling with electric cars, but a racing series still needs combustion engines.»But the drone taxi will become even faster reality:

Buben dream fulfilled - cultural asset saved / / Stefan Hotzdie
Americans prepare the first person landing on the moon, which will take place in the summer of 1969.British and French celebrate the maiden flight of their overset jet Concorde, which succeeds in early March.In Switzerland, there is auto -euphoria that tests SBB an electric locomotive that is to reach more than 200 kilometers per hour.
And in the Swiss experimental reactor in Lucens there is almost a meltdown.Nevertheless: the belief in progress in early 1969 was at a climax.Nothing was distant than dealing with the 19th century steam -reduced.
But just fifty years ago, on January 25, 1969, 16 people founded the Zürcher Oberland steam train association (DVZO) in Hinwil."At the time, we could hardly imagine that a train would ever go," says Werner Frei, who was the first president: "We only had an idea, no locomotive and no railway line."Idea from the city of Zurich came to the Oberland.
Thomas Hager, the son of a VBZ craftsman, was already restored by the Tramwagen as a secondary school student and knew almost everything about steam locomotives.In April 1968 the newspaper “Tat” published a portrait of the 16-year-old.In it, Hager made the suggestion to use a route of the Uerikon-Bauma-Bahn (UBB) Uerikon-Bauma-Bauma (UBB) in 1948.
During the holidays he had already worked for the steam path just opened between Blonay and Chamby above Lake Geneva.The known Zurich composer and music teacher Armin Schibler met the fantasy and realist base of the newspaper report with Hager and then addressed the communities along the UeBB route and their teachers a circular for a “museum track with steam locomotive romance in Zurich Oberland”.This should enable a “traffic -free small railway ride for the youth”.
Werner Frei kept the document.At that time, the real teacher had started to write for newspapers, which he did for fifty years, at times also for the NZZ.In the “Zurich Oberländer” he continues to spare the thought and wrote about the “revival of a past period that has already become strange to us”.
The echo remained moderate, the hurdles seemed insurmountable.The tracks of the UBB were still used for goods transport and were already torn out in other places.The hope of using the Bubikon - Hombrechtikon section for steam trains smashed quickly.
However, the SBB still operated the 12 -kilometer route between Hinwil and Bauma before buses were used for the time being in 1969 for two years.The responsible transport companies in Zürcher Oberland were not interested in competition.The SBB also gross the DVZO cool, and a steam operation on the route was "unthinkable". The
Beginnings of the DVZO were not easy internally either.There were those who not only wanted to play with the model railway in the basement, but also wanted to be in the driver's cab of a locomotive.The chronicler Frei speaks of a pile of enthusiasts, fantasy, romantics and nostalgics.
Cooperation with Thomas Hager was soon no longer possible."He only saw his thing," says Frei.Hager later emigrated to Brazil, where he succumbed to an accident at work early on.
However, there were also those rail insiders and realists, including free, who never followed on a steam locomotive, but persistently pursued the idea of a museum railway.In addition to a route, locomotives, of which Sulzer later provided two, also needed, but also cars and machine operators.1971 managed to carry out the first steam trips with borrowed vehicles as part of a folk festival in Bäretswil.The echo was extremely positive - what is a steam locomotive in the traffic center, cool and lifeless, against such a tractor under full steam?
The seeds opened.In 1974 the DVZO was already in possession of four locomotives.Interest in the communities rose, and SBB also had their negative attitude under the influence of chief machine engineer Jakob Rutschmann.
In May 1978, the DVZO started regular operation between Hinwil and Bauma.Since then, even if only seasonally and on weekends, a timetable offer that was also included in the SBB course book has existed as long as it was printed.Today, the DVZO has a tightly regulated company organization and a handsome vehicle park, which is entertained with a lot of volunteer work after a fixed cycle.
Part of the industrial landscape with a boy's dream began to preserve an important cultural asset.It was meant well when the last steam locomotives were set up in parks and at train stations in the post -war period;The last of its kind was transported away from Dietikon station to the workshop in 2011.
In the long run, they would have been sentenced to death.Werner Frei, fascinated by the mechanics, maintains two classic car cars and knows: If you never move them, there will be a standing damage.
This also applies and especially to steam locomotives that will break at some point if you don't wait regularly and also drive them.The museum railway is an important element of the historic industrial landscape of Zürcher Oberland.The most impressive in Neuthal, where the viaduct of the UBB, which was still initiated by Adolf Guyer-Zeller, spans its spinning.
Bauma developed into a center in the history of the railway, where today the former Basel Perronhalle protects the DVZO car park from wind and weather.In Uster, Switzerland's oldest round cord was only in operation in the 1850s, namely as long as the route in the Glattal ended in Uster.Then she housed a foundry, a bicycle factory and a soft cheese dairy.
A good twenty years ago, she received her original provision back as a winter quarters and workshop for the DVZO locomotives, a monument conservation luck.The founders of the museum railway were, without ancestoring it, the forerunners of those industrial archaeologists who have been committed to maintaining historical textile factories and power plant systems in the Zurich Oberland since the late 1970s.This is a reason to celebrate, if only on the back burner, finally it is not season.
But in exceptional cases, the steam trains drive through the winter Oberland on this anniversary weekend.Interaction of a train of the steam train association in May 1979 in Neuthal.DVZO "We only had an idea, no locomotive and no railway line."

Deafening noise and bad for the climate / / aviation The renowned think tank ICCT warns of the planned overs sound aircraft.
It no longer flies, but you can still visit her, the legendary concorde.In various aviation museums in the world, visitors can get an impression today how it must have been once to race with excess sound over the Atlantic.The superfluous flights with the Concorde were partially well booked from 1976 to 2003.
And apparently the dream is far from dreamy.Several companies to be taken seriously, some, some of them together with industry giants such as Lockheed Martin, are developing new overs sound flight devices for intercontinental trips.In an expert opinion, the renowned Thinktank ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) now warns of the negative consequences of a renaissance of global overform.
The shock waves when breaking through the sound barrier would regularly sound with loud bangs.The increased noise when starting and landing could make the surroundings of airports uninhabitable, and significantly higher CO2 emissions would be poison for the global climate. 50 overformal flights per day of the environmental and traffic experts from ICCT end up in their realistic scenario of 2000 overs sound aircraft, which inYear 2035 head for around 160 airports.The most frequented airports include Dubai and London Heathrow in this model.
Based on today's number of growth and the forecasts of one of the potential manufacturers, the ICCT experts at these two airports expect around 300 starts and landings of oversamated aircraft per day.But in Switzerland, too, 2035 would be expected to be 50 over sound flights per day.Due to their geographical location, a whole series of countries should expect regular overs sound bang.
In addition, around 100 million tons of additional CO2 would get into the earth's atmosphere per year.The ICCT experts therefore call for future overs sound aircraft to commit themselves to environmental standards to ensure the acceptance of their projects."Before further development of overshaly aircraft, manufacturers should first commit themselves to comply with the existing standards for conventional aircraft and further noise protection measures," demands Dan Rutherford, senior author of the ICCT study.
International air traffic is already pushing as much CO2 as all over Germany.If the number of passengers continues to grow, the emissions are likely to triple by 2050.In addition, it has been undoubtedly proven that aircraft noise has serious health consequences for the population on the ground.

Germania is hardly the last bankruptcy / / by Laura Frommbergzürich.Germania Flight ST 3711 from Fuerteventura in Nuremberg landed at 1.11 a.m.
Passengers and crew on board the plane did not yet know that it was a special flight.Half an hour later, the airline announced yesterday morning that it applied for bankruptcy and immediately stopped flight operations.It was only in January that the German airline had an acute money problem and was looking for investors - a complete sale was also in the room.
Although it recently said that an investor had promised 15 million euros in financial aid - the money did not come.On Friday, Germania had to admit that she could no longer pay wages.The rapid crash of the airline shows an example of the industry.
Consolidation in Europe is in full swing, and if you lack the size and financial cushion, you run the risk of having a similar fate: either the bankruptcy or the purchase by a competitor.Quite sure Germania will not be the last airline that disappears from Europe's sky this year, while the big five are further gaining power in Europe.The big five, these are the Lufthansa group, which also includes Swiss, the British-Airways mother IAG, Air France-KLM as well as the cheap airlines Ryanair and Easyjet.
Last year, their flights made up more than 50 percent of European traffic for the first time.After the end of Air Berlin, Lufthansa, Ryanair and Easyjet mainly pushed into the gaps.You have massively increased the offer.
The example of the USA shows that these 50 percent are not the end.The market cleanup has long since taken place there.After merging, bankruptcy and takeovers, the largest five US airlines divide around 90 percent of passenger traffic among themselves.
Such a scenario is not desirable for passengers in Europe.Because: Less competition likes to attract rising prices.Poisonous cocktail for Airlines but the company's death in the sky will continue.
The trigger for the problems of many airlines last year was the poisonous cocktail of high fuel price, price war on European routes and many delays that resulted in high compensation payments to passengers.Germania also blames these factors for the financial problems.The situation should not improve much this year.
Small airlines in particular are stumbling.They lack the financial cushion to survive.This was shown in 2018:
With Azur Air (Germany), Cobalt Air (Cyprus), Primera Air (Latvia), private Air and Skywork (Switzerland), Small Planet (Germany, Lithuania, Poland) and VLM (Belgium), it hit a whole handful of smaller providers.There is not much room for optimism when it comes to the Swiss Germania subsidiary.It continues to fly.
But she too is exposed to this tough environment.And with a fleet of only three Airbus jets against competitors such as Lufthansa, Swiss, Easyjet and Eurowings, it is anything but easy.Special prices for stranded zurich.
If an airline stops the company from one day to the next, not only the employees suffer, but also the passengers.Those who have booked a package tour are lucky.In these cases, the tour operators must ensure replacement.
If you had booked your flight ticket directly, however, you are on your own.After all: Other airlines jump into the breach in the current case and offer special tariffs for Germania customers.Those affected should report directly to Austrian Airlines, Condor, Eurowings, Lufthansa, Sun Express, Swiss and Tuifly, shared the Federal Association of German Air Transport Management

Frachtflieger are allowed to start, passengers stay on the floor / / by Alexander Müller, Alessandra Paone and Mischa Hauswirthbasel.
Right on French air traffic controllers - that's not uncommon.That you do it so spontaneously at EuroAirport, but already: During the shift change on Tuesday at 8 p.m., various air fuse do not appear for work.This has consequences for around 3700 passengers.
2900 cannot fly to Basel because their flights are canceled at short notice.Around 800 strands in Basel.You spend the night in hotels or travel on your own.
On Twitter, a relative complains that his sister had to spend the night at Mulhouse station.Yesterday morning there was another half a dozen departure
out of ;The unavailable machines were missing.
After all, from eight o'clock, air traffic at the airport could be handled somewhat normally.The problem seems to be solved for the time being, but many questions remain unanswered.The BAZ tried several times yesterday to get answers.
But the MEITALPORT MEIRARPORT seemed for a long time, so that one had to ask whether, in addition to the air traffic controller, the media managers had also kicked the strike.Not an emergency concept at a later afternoon, and after a previously agreed interview with airport director Matthias Suhr had been canceled again, the EuroAirport finally took a position on the air traffic controller strike.Suhr was apparently on vacation during the incident and had to return yesterday to "extinguish the fire", as the Basler Zeitung was added.
Airlines in passenger traffic were particularly affected by the strike, including Easyjet, Air France, Lufthansa, Wizz Air, British Airways and Tuifly.Many flights that should have landed in Basel were canceled by the respective airline, others were diverted, such as Stuttgart and Zurich, says airport spokeswoman Viviane Gaskell.Usually the strikes of the responsible authority would have to be announced 48 hours in advance.
Because that failed in this case, the EuroAirport was caught on the wrong foot.There was obviously no emergency concept."Due to a risk assessment, the French flight control authority did not organize a piket service at EuroAirport," said Gaskell.
However, security was guaranteed at all times.The airport did not want to say how many pilots have strike and how many are normally on duty in the tower.For comparison: In the far more busy airport in Zurich, in addition to one head of service per shift, only three pilots are responsible for the entire company, and four are four.
Freight aircraft are more important due to a minimal operation of the air traffic control on Tuesday evening between 8 p.m. and midnight, exactly four flights could be handled.A passenger plane could land and only three freight planes were allowed to take off.The EuroAirport did not really answer why the Express Fracht Airport gave the first hundred frustrated passengers.
"This has to do with the given capacity and was coordinated with the airlines," Gaskell writes on the corresponding inquiries Derbasler Zeitungknapp.The airports would not have complained at the airport because of the circumstances.Also on the bottom of the pilot strike, Gaskell does not want to comment.
That is up to the French flight control authority.It was nothing there to find out there either.The strike may be related to the call of the French union CGT, which interferes in the political debate about the right to demonstrate.
This is to be severely restricted in France. "On February 5, CGT called for a day of demonstrations and strikes," said it yesterday in the union.
It is about resistance to the government's project, which wants to restrict basic freedom rights in response to violence.In France, the debate is currently underway whether politics should prohibit the Gilets Jaunes protests because this popular movement always occurs with violent incidents with violence and massive property damage.The air traffic controllers of the EuroAirport are affiliated CGT transport, which could not be achieved yesterday for a statement regarding the strike.
The question now is how such a situation can be prevented in the future.The airport's answer to this: "That is the responsibility of the French flight control authority." According to Gaskell, French air traffic control would actually have to ensure flights with Swiss traffic rights.This is contractually intended.
“The airport expects the flight control authorities to take suitable measures so that such an incident does not repeat themselves.»Incidentally, this incident is an absolute exception;As a rule, the corresponding on -call services would be offered in the event of announced strikes so that flight operations could be maintained.
No compensation for cancellation for strike basel.If there are flights, passengers are usually entitled to compensation.These can be up to 600 euros per passenger.
However, this does not apply if the airline is not to blame, as is the case with a strike of the air traffic controllers.However, passengers are partly entitled to supply services on site: In the event of delays of over two hours and an affected route of over 1500 kilometers, the airline must provide passengers at the airport meals and drinks and offer them the opportunity to make two phone calls or two faxesOr sending emails, explains Laura Kauczynski from the Airhelp passenger portal on request.
"If the waiting time exceeds midnight, the airlines must also provide accommodation and enable the transport there," she says.A cancellation of the flight due to a strike does not release the airline from the duty of transport.Finally, the trip was paid by the customer.

With SUV and helicopter direct import, the ski slope / / tourism Air Zermatt and Hertz are criticized for a new luxury offer for tourists.The "fastest ski lift in the world" is located in Valais.
At least that's how it sees the Air Zermatt, which promotes its new business idea with this superlative.Together with the car rental company Hertz, Air Zermatt put together an "exclusive package" that combines the "best of mobility in the air and on the street": First it goes with a diesel-powered "Luxury SUV" of the Volvo brand from any SwissHertz station “Comfortable” to Raron to Valais and from there using a helicopter directly to the slopes around the Matterhorn.
The “adventure” costs a total of 1665 francs, a maximum of five ski tourists can come together, in the best case, the best case does 333 francs per capita.The price includes the rental car for 24 hours, the helicopter flight, as well as a skiing for the whole day and optionally the rent of ski equipment.The offer had been booked for the first time for the last weekend, confirmed by a group of five, like Gerold Biner, head of Air Zermatt.
However, the helicopter could not take off - because of the nasty weather.The adversities with which the promoters have to struggle at the political level are of a completely different kind.Mountain Wilderness asked her to do without this business model.
It is "almost symbolic of the ignorance of the environmental problems of our time," writes the Alpine protection organization to the two providers."While tens of thousands of people in Switzerland and worldwide go on the road to climate protection worldwide, they promote completely oversized, environmentally harmful mobility as leisure fun." However, their demands are in vain."There is probably no better way to bring the unique beauty of our mountains closer to the guests of Zermatt," says Air-Zermatt-CEO Biner.
And makes it clear: the supply runs as long as there is demand.At least Raron's flight trip is asked by some of the ski tourists:
This option has existed since 2010.Biner cannot say how many bookings have been made since then.However, the demand is "emotional consistent".
With the helicopter flight directly to the ski area, the arrival time is shortened from the Valais main valley to Zermatt from 90 to 15 minutes.Air Zermatt owes the “social engagement” of the car rental company to the fact that Hertz came to the partnership.At least that's how Hertz justifies the cooperation:
You think much of the Air Zermatt rescue operations.However, these are deficient, with the partner offer they want to help Air Zermatt.Hertz leaves what that means financially
Obviously, 60 liters of kerosene per flight ecological concerns do not have: The 60 liter kerosene for the flight, with the best possible line -up, the car rental company considers it justifiable.
You can also “only” provide a Volvo and no PS-stronger car, and you can explicitly point out the desired group size of five people in the advertising in order to keep the utilization as much as possible.Mountain Wilderness considers these arguments advanced."This smells a lot of subsequent justification and a beautiful talk," says Maren Kern, managing director of Mountain Wilderness.
“Hertz and Air Zermatt help to destroy what they live as a tourism provider: the glaciers and the snow.»The 15-minute flight needs as much fuel as 1000 to 1200 car kilometers and has an additional noise disorder from Raron to the valley of Zermatt, Kern calculates."This is not justifiable for us." The Alpine protectors hope that the providers will still rethink.
In March Mountain Wilderness will demonstrate a place in the Alps - currently still secret.As part of this year's “Stop Heliskiing” campaign, the Alpine protectors will reaffirm what they have been demanding for years: a restriction of tourist mountain flying.Stefan Häneda's “Exclusive Package” costs CHF 1665 with a helicopter flight and 333 francs for a maximum of five people per capita.

Showering and a bar are not enough / / the plan to crack the American monopoly on the large -scale aircraft has failed.Also because the Europeans started too late.
Andreas Spaeth, Gerhard Bläskelufrahn is an emotional affair for many.The news of the hiring of the Airbus-A380 program by 2021 commented on sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktum, the Chairman of the largest customer, Emirates, with words such as "disappointment" and "sadness".Emirates President Sir Tim Clark was the driving force behind the only double-storey aircraft in the world.
Personally, he had postponed many innovations, such as the first installation of showers in a transport aircraft or the establishment of a bar lounge for premium passengers.Not surprisingly, the A380, of which around 230 are currently on the road, is one of the most popular aircraft for passengers.The Airbus boss Tom Enders also hurried to insure himself: «The end of the A380 production does not mean the end of the A380 program.»
Airbus promises its customers the further support of the aircraft well into the 2030s.Against the "Queen of the Skies" how emotionally the aviation is, only a few days ago, when the Boeing 747, the Jumbo jet, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first flight in 1969.The 747 is worshiped worldwide as the "Queen of the Skies";
A form of affection that the less elegant A380 could never win.Over three decades after the start of the 747, the Europeans had broken up at the beginning of the millennium to crack the monopoly of the dumpling worldwide aircraft manufacturer from Seattle.At that time celebrated as a symbol for European unity, even as an industrial counterpart to the unit currency, the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane for theoretically up to 853 passengers, should bring Europeans on the offensive.
Boeing had made enormous profits with her monopoly on giant jets for many decades that enabled other programs subsidized and combat prices.But from today's perspective, the timing and the market assessment by Airbus were already wrong."We were at least ten years late," admitted Airbus CEO Enders.
A steadily increasing air traffic was expected between the MEGA hubs, which can only be mastered by larger aircraft.In fact, the global number of passengers reach new records every year.However, as hoped for by Airbus, the A380 program, but other aircraft, did not benefit from this.
Because both Boeing with the 777, which was started in 1995 and especially the 787 Dreamliner and Airbus itself with the A350, launched new efficient, economical two -beers, which even flew at cheaper unit costs per seat than the significantly larger A380 with its four engines."The end of the A380 is the end of the large four -beamed aircraft," said Enders.With the two-jarriers, non-stop long distances between secondary sleeves suddenly also could be operated, which proved to be great success in the passengers that were tired of switching to overcrowded gross airports.
Airbus put on the wrong horse with his giant and should have recognized 20 years ago before the start of the A380 that the 747 had already exceeded its zenith as a passenger plane at that time.Their latest model, the 747 - 8, which came onto the market in 2012, turned out to be a shop keeper in the passenger version.While the Boeing 747 will continue to be built after 50 years and more than 1,500 copies sold, although on the industrial flame and predominantly as a freighter, the A380 program now ends in 2021.
The largest aircraft in the world is no longer built just 14 years after the introduction to the 2007 linie service.Airbus shareholder A380 was particularly fond of being overweight.
The maintenance and kerosic costs are much too high compared to those of the Boeing 777 - 300 or the 777 - 9, which was served two years ago.The efforts of the aircraft manufacturer to reconcile the construction of new and more economical engines with Rolls-Royce failed.In addition, renovation work was necessary to dock at many airports.
In addition, the aircraft with a catalog price of almost $ 446 million is very expensive.But despite the huge economic failure, it should be noted that the end of the A380 for the Airbus group itself is not a disaster.The meaning is too low for this.
In addition, Emirates ordered other aircraft after canceling the orders.Most of the time, the “damage” is already processed in the 2018 figures: corresponding provisions were € 463 million.
Nevertheless, net profit in 2018 rose by 29 % to € 3.05 billion.Sales grew by 8 % to € 63.7 billion.Airbus is located on a comfortable order stock of € 460 billion.
The view of the share price, which increased by over 3 % on Thursday, shows on the one hand that investors do not mourn the giant bird, and on the other hand, that the company is currently doing well.The short life of the giant birdsk.·
When the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, at the end of April 2005, rose to his first flight to the sky over Toulouse, which was almost almost for the European Aerospace Group EADs and for Francea holiday .For the then French President Jacques Chirac, the three -story giant bird was an example of "what Europe is capable of if you bundle the forces in the individual countries".
Despite the Franco-German disputes in and around the group that had lasted over the years, the cheers were great at the time.Airbus and its parent company EADS at the time calculated with a market potential of up to 1500 such giant machines within 20 years.
The development of the aircraft started in 1996.At the end of 2000, the then CEO Philippe Camus and Rainer Hertrich gave the green light for construction.Complicated logistics was devised.
From 16 works in Great Britain, Spain, Germany and France, wings, fuselage parts and conductors are transported over the sea, rivers and at the end by truck to Toulouse for final assembly in a huge hall.But after the first flight, the euphoria was quickly over.Problems with the cables delivered from Germany led to considerable delays.
It was not until the end of October 2007 that Singapore Airlines put the first machine on duty.In 2012, cracks in the wings caused further difficulties and reworking.The orders remained far behind the expectations.

Expensive emergency landing for the A380 / / could never really take off the machine, which was intended as a competition with Boeing's Jumbo.Public loans for a prestige project that is too big remain.
Gerhard Bläske, Michael Raschdie Agony of the giant aircraft A380 from Airbus takes some time that came as a surprise: With the announcement to give up the production of the aircraft 2021, which was put into service twelve years ago, the European aircraft manufacturer must probably the largest economic flopAccident in aviation history.The failure of the concorde overs sound aircraft, the caravelle or other machines is thus put in the shade.
The CEO Thomas Enders announced the message on the day of the balance sheet press conference in relative words.After the big customer Emirates 39 of the 53 orders for the largest transport aircraft in the world and instead 30 Airbus A350 - 900 and 40 A330 ordered, there was no longer any basis to continue production.As a result of this decision, there is no longer any substantial order stock, the company announced.
There are currently still 40 orders for the aircraft, but only the 14 Emirates and 3 all-Nippon airline orders are considered secure.Incorrect assessment of the market since 1996, whose construction was finally decided in December 2000, became the victim of a huge misjudgment of the market.
"The most intelligent and economical solution for the growing volume of traffic in airspace and at airports", for which Airbus had predicted a market potential of up to 1500 machines within twenty years, never really got going.By the end of January 2019, there were just 313 orders.234 machines have been delivered.
The production, which was once to be raised to up to 45 giant aircraft each year, will be reduced to 6 and 2020 to 6 pieces in 2019.At the end of 2017, an order from the major customer Emirates again gave the A380 a short breathing.But the hope of being able to convince customers in China of the advantages of the aircraft in the meantime was not fulfilled.
With the Boeing 777, the Boeing 787 and even the long -distance jet A350 developed in -house, the A380 had strong and, above all, much more economic competitors against which he could not do anything.The investments of well over 25 billion euros are largely lost, and public loans from Spain, France, Great Britain and Germany should never be repaid.The development costs of new aircraft often have up to a third of the governments with subsidized loans.
If an aircraft model flops, Airbus does not have to repay the starting aid.The group has always been a game ball of European politicians, especially in Germany and France, but also in the UK and Spain.For the construction of the A380, the company is said to have received around 3.5 billion euros in loans from the states mentioned.
According to information from the NZZ, Airbus has already repaid 2.5 billion euros, so that European taxpayers probably have to write off loans of around 1 billion euros.Witness with Boeinges can, however, doubt that this will be a teaching for governments in Berlin and Paris.Rather, the subsidies are likely to stop.
However, this applies to politics on this and beyond the Atlantic, because the American competitor Boeing is similar.For decades, a bitter dispute between the United States and the EU has developed over unjustified grants for the home aircraft manufacturer.But Airbus and Boeing are probably too important as national icons that Washington and Paris and Berlin could finally agree to leave the two corporations to themselves and the competition.
After all, the 3,500 employees who make the machine in a very complicated logistics chain of locations in the UK, Germany, Spain and France, where final assembly takes place, do not have to worry too much.Due to the very good demand for short and medium-sized aircraft, you should find a new job within Airbus.The A350 is already being built in Toulouse.
But why did the giant bird, which had been prepared for so long, failed with so many laurels?One of the reasons was a bumpy start with expensive delays.In addition, Airbus granted the customer for the aircraft, which could offer space in its maxi version 853 passengers, far too many say.
The variety of variants made production more expensive.The size of the machine limited the number of potential target airports and made adjustments to the infrastructure necessary.The end has also made a decisive contribution to the fact that the Airline strategy of the ruler of Dubai did not work.
The A380 on the soil comment: The Emir of Dubai has been thoroughly offset.Page 11 too little efficient:
Other planes fly cheaper.Page 23 complicated: 16 works from 4 countries provide parts for final assembly.Page 23

Personal control / / Ueli Maurer, Federal President with ground liability, swings into the air.In the past few days he has been able to receive the new Federal Council Jet.
And directly from the hands of Oskar J. Schwenk, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pilatus Aircraft.Maurer commissioned the new BusinessJet PC-24 in 2014 when he was Federal President for the first time.At the time, he wanted to land a August 1st Coup and ceremoniously announced the procurement on the rollout of the PC-24 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Pilatus works.
But then the plans seeped into the media prematurely.It is funny that masons were trying to do a new aircraft for the Federal Council because the SVP Federal Council is not one of the frequent flyers in the Federal Council.If already lifted off, Maurer must have said, then preferred to be in a flight made in Switzerland.
(HMO) Hansjörg Brunner, opponent of exit bureaucracy, runs against the Federal Council.The Thurgau FDP National Council does not want to accept that the state government is repeating the introduction of a regulatory cost center, which is repeated by Parliament, which is supposed to clean up with the "Bureaucracy".He therefore submitted assertive motion together with several dozen bourgeois council colleagues that wants to make legs to the state government.
But Brunner bites Granit at the Department of Economic Minister Guy Parmelin (SVP): For reasons of efficiency, the Federal Council does not want to introduce a new authority and is also not impressed by assertive motion, as he let Brunner know these days.The Federal Council does what else Parliament likes to do for the people:
He simply does not implement the orders given to him.(Fon) Hans-Jörg Bertschi, entrepreneur, falls out of the frame.
The Board of Directors of the Bertschi Group, who employs 3000 employees in 38 countries and writes 920 million sales, founded the “Wirtschafts-Committee for Insta post-negotiations” with like-minded entrepreneurs.The Tages-Anzeiger reports in his yesterday's edition.The aim of the group is to combat the framework agreement in its current form.
The text does not take too little account of the “interests of Switzerland and its economy”, and too many red lines have been exceeded.Among other things, among other things, are the entrepreneur and FDP National Councilor Peter Schilliger and Otto Suhner, Board of Directors of the globally successful manufacturer of industrial special tools and special components.(FSC)
Claudio Zanetti, complainant, is an attentive listener on the Swiss radio.As such, he noticed a "grotesque one -sidedness" of the "Echos der Zeit" on the subject of anti -Semitism.The SVP National Council writes this in a complaint to Ombudsman Roger Blum.
The news magazine would consistently hide the "Islamist anti-Semitism, and even get rid of it".He leads several contributions to the proof of his thesis.For example this: When the 85-year-old disabled Holocaust-surviving Mireille Knoll Knoll was raped, tortured and murdered by a Muslim extremist in her apartment in March 2018, the "Echo" let the "Old Communist Journalist Dominique Vidal record:" Anti-Semitism isIn France today a marginal phenomenon. ›» And when a number of Labor MP left Jeremy Corbyn's party at the beginning of this week, correspondent Martin Alioth failed to know his audience that “Corbyn's anti-Semitism is one of the most important reasons for the step of the dissidents,” said Zanetti.
(FSC) Moritz Leuenberger, pastors' son, lets Germany know how to do good traffic policy: with the fifth command "You shouldn't kill".In 2000, he suddenly realized that the office imposed him an ethical mission, a mission, the former SP Federal Council told the news magazine Spiegel:
«How can I prevent deaths as Transport Minister?"The" enemy of the racers ", the" Kluge Minister of Transport, who was not a lobby "with the program" Via Sicura ", ensured that the Swiss streets were one of the safest in the world today praises the mirror.For the German incumbent Andreas Scheuer, who does not think of speed on motorways, Leuenberger has only shaking my head.
The fact that Scheuer, the Christian Socialist, apparently does not derive from the fifth commandment, does not give him a political mandate.(Fon) Andri Silberschmidt, language acrobat, is President of Jung -Freichnsinnigen Schweiz (JFS).
Recently, his board brooded over the framework agreement for a long time and agreed in the following position: The young -free "welcome the agreement in its basic features, but in the current form it is not sufficient for the JFS requirements".The Federal Council is asked to "negotiate improvements".
President Silmerschmidt, on the other hand, flooded on social media that his party had spoken "in principle for the institutional agreement", it only needs "precise improvements in an additional protocol".The solo run towards Brussels irritated friend and enemy.(FSC)
Jeremy Corbyn, Revolutionary Fossil, disappears crocodile tears.He publicly regretted that seven parliamentary group members leave his Labor party and from then on politicizing as a "independent" in the lower house.You accuse your party leader anti -Semitism.
He also has sympathy for Brexit because the EU is a capitalist monster for him.Despite his regret, Corbyn will secretly look forward to the departure of the seven.In the next parliamentary elections, his comrades can set up left -wing candidates in their constituencies to the taste of the boss and no longer have to deal with social democratic legal deviations.
Because from Corbyn's perspective, it has never had space in the party.(Hü) Kuno Gurtner, Landlord, criticizes the presentation of the World week.
In the “Personal Control” of February 14, 19, when it comes to National Councilor Kathy Riklin (CVP), there is talk of a “new rental practice”, according to which the city of Zurich “no longer” tolerated in their apartments."Prominent victim of the new rental practice" is entertainer Christian Jott Jenny.Gurtner, as head of communication of the urban property management, writes: «In fact, properties city of Zurich Jenny has asked to terminate his apartment.
However, the request was not related to the new rental regulations.According to the rental agreement, Jenny was obliged to live in the city of Zurich.With his election as the mayor of St. Moritz, this requirement was obviously no longer fulfilled.»

The Federal Council applies for two billion francs for the army / / Bern.The focus of the 2019 arms program is not due to the weapons systems.
The Federal Council wants to strengthen the Enlightenment and logistics.Overall, he applied for a good two billion francs for the army to the parliament.The population expects the army to ensure Switzerland security in the event of a changed threat situation, said the new Minister of Defense Viola Amherd before the Bundeshausmedien yesterday.
This needs the necessary equipment for this.Since clashes are increasingly taking place in superstructure in the middle of the civilian population, the army needs reliable information to protect people in the event of a conflict, according to Amherd.In addition, she must be able to perform her tasks even at night and in poor visibility.
That is why the army should be able to buy remaining light amplifiers, thermal imaging devices and laser target devices for CHF 213 million.In addition, the Federal Council wants to equip various associations with a tactical educational system (TASYS).It is a three-axis, armed Mowag Eagle V, which is equipped with a multi-sensor system.
This includes day and night vision cameras, laser removal meters and laser pointers.For 100 fully equipped vehicles, the Federal Council applies to the parliament of CHF 380 million.The 8.1 cm mining thrower, which is over 40 years old, is also to be replaced.
Finally, the Federal Council wants to replace outdated trucks and applies for CHF 150 million for 360 trucks.The IVECO vehicles are designed for various missions.In total, the arms program is 661 million francs.
A further 414 million francs are to be invested in real estate projects.Among other things, a base for 600 containers is to be built in Rothenburg (LU), two old halls are to be replaced on the Payerne airfield and the weapon space in Thun is to be expanded.No large cyber projects contain the army message framework loans for army material in the amount of CHF 762 million.
This includes, among other things, the personal equipment of the army members or material for leadership support.CHF 150 million are planned for project planning, testing and preparation of procurement, for training ammunition and the management of the ammunition CHF 172 million.The army message does not contain larger projects in the cyber area.
However, the Federal Council wants to provide funds in connection with cyber defense in the project planning, testing and preparation for procurement.Army chief Philippe Rebord announced concrete projects for the army message of the coming year.Sda

According to the SBB of the Airport Frankfurt / / by Peter Bodenmannthie SBB, the SBB wants to go into the business with flying electrical saucers.
Good this way .Klaus J. Stöhlker is the media spokesman for the absolutely unsuccessful Zurich foundation against aircraft noise.Paid or unpaid?
That remains.So so .Soon, 50 million passengers will start in Zurich a year, get out and change.
Simple and simple because Switzerland is attractive and the Swiss like to fly.A surcharge to the prices of plane tickets makes sense.But he will only stop a few from flying.
There are probably only power-to-fuel solutions against the CO2 emissions.Even climate -neutral fuels do nothing in the fight against aircraft noise.Anyone who changes the approach and deployment routes in the Zurich area simply puts on other population groups.
The black Peter can hike, but unfortunately it cannot dissolve into air.New ideas are needed: building block 1
_ Malpensa Airport is located in the less inhabited pampa north of Milan.It is subdued because Rome won the race for the hub in Italy.
Building block 2 _ The air distance between Zurich and Malpensa is only 200 kilometers.
That between Bern and Malpensa even less.Building block 3 _ larger and smaller electrical planes will only prevail at short distances of up to 300 kilometers.
Anyway .Building block 4 _
The SBB rely on electrical saucers of the Lilium brand.Frankfurt Airport on Volocopter.Things are said to be environmentally friendly, cheap and quiet with up to 300 things around 2025.
In forty minutes you would be from Zurich train station in Malpensa.Building block 5 _
The Zürcher would have to snap Malpensa to create a new window to the world with a hub.Almost all praise Alfred Escher.How would Escher run the fight against aircraft noise?
Certainly not with the same whine of the Zurich Foundation against aircraft noise.For interested parties: Today, the bus is the most environmentally friendly means of transport per person and kilometers.Because the rail power mix contains a lot of gas and coal current.
Still .In contrast to the cars, there are no diesel driving bans for the buses in German city centers.Nevertheless, thanks to the EU, the buses will switch to environmentally friendly electric drives.
Small, agile electric buses that will be in the future in the future can and will ensure additional movement in the market.But less is not flown.Unfortunately .

Without Airbus, Europe would have no aviation industry / / Georges Bridel before Fifty years before, the United States dominated the world market of transport aircraft with 82 percent with manufacturers Boeing and Douglas.
The shared markets of the English and French had no chance at 18 percent.A final US monopoly threatened by Boeing and Douglas.The Europeans would certainly have disappeared from the scene.
The only possible solution was in the merger of the existing capacities to the Airbus company and a new product line.Thanks to strategic foresight and an excellent product, the A-300 1970 was a success.However, the breakthrough did not succeed until 1976 on the world market.
Boeing had not taken the Airbus seriously for years with the arrogance of the monopolist and later had to follow suit the products B-757 and B-767.This "catch -up" was unthinkable on both sides without state funding.The subsidies are a permanent topic in the entire civil aircraft industry.
This concern direct support in development and research, both in the USA and Europe, and of course cross -subsidies, usually from the military to the civil sector.In the United States, the military aviation programs are about five times as large as all European programs.The resulting strengthening of the civil sector is obvious.
Some of the commercial aircraft in the United States are even based on designs for military aircraft (Boeing B-707 and B-747). With the B-747 Boeing had the complete monopoly: Product line 747 was not modernized for years, and were even out of date.In addition, the prices were inappropriately high.Then coupling shops play an important role in the airline business:
Purchases are made together at the same manufacturer.Savings are possible thanks to the quantity, the “supply chain” and cross-subsidies.To achieve a real parity, Airbus had to follow suit.
The recently announced early, lossy demolition of A380 production should not be isolated, but should be considered in the strategic context.The market development has given the Boeing long-distance concept for the time being with the operation of point point connections using the two-engine aircraft B-777 and B-787.Airbus has the machines A330 and A350.
In view of the overcrowding of airports in the megacitys, an airplane like A380 could be attractive again.Maybe the A380 was just too early on the market.A side view of the military aviation sector is on offer:
In contrast to the civil aircraft, the European nations did not manage to team up in military aircraft construction.England, Germany, Italy and Spain build the Eurofighter together in series.France and Sweden, in turn, rely on national programs.
With three programs instead of just one for the same purpose, you cannot exist on the world market.The production figures are not sufficient for cost efficiency.A few years ago, the German Federal Government prohibited the merger of its own industries with those of England.
The then Defense Minister de Maizière justified this with the "securing of the competition", and the coordinator of the Federal Government for Aerospace Technology Peter Hintze enforced the nonsensical ban with the Chancellor.Due to a lack of European rationalization and export support, US struggle aircraft today dominate the world market with machines F-15, F-18, F-18 and F-35. However, there are also successful direct state interventions that require a differentiated judgment: 1971The then Rolls-Royce with the development of the Grosstriebwerk RB-211 and went bankrupt.
The state took over the company, mutated into Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited, separated the insignificant car area and renovated the company, including the development of the RB-211.The conservative government of Heath was responsible.In 1987 Rolls-Royce was rightly privatized again and is now one of the most valuable mechanical engineering and technology groups of the UK.
Without this state aid, a decisive strategic element would also be missing for Europe (!) Today.Tens of thousands of jobs in the high-tech sector would not exist.Airbus was a European-strategically correct decision, despite some less successful projects.
The higher the level of the analyzes, the more they remove from economic and financial simulation games.Airbus is not a politically wanted group, but resulted from strategic and industrial and ultimately economic necessity.He is therefore not suitable as an argument against state industrial policy.

The Ju-Air will soon offer flight flights again / / Erich Aschwandenauf The Ju-Air website seems as if there had never been the crash with twenty fatalities from last August.Under the "Flight offer" section can be read:
«From March to November, the Ju-52 starts every Saturday and partly on Wednesday afternoon to the extremely popular sightseeing flights from Dübendorf.»An early reservation for the 2019 flight season is recommended.
But the Alpine circuit and experience flights are not resumed as quickly as hoped for by the airline - namely already in March.Last November, the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) issued a flight ban for the two remaining classic cars of the Ju-Air.Grounding occurred after considerable corrosion damage was discovered on the wreck of the plane crashed on August 4, 2018 at Piz Segnas.
In an interim report, the Swiss Security Investigation Center (Sust) stated that so far there were no evidence that these technical defects were responsible for the tragic crash of the classic car with the identification HB HOT.Back then, there was no great interest in flights.According to Bazl spokesman Urs Holderegger, nothing has changed in principle:
«In March the JU-52 machines will certainly not fly.We cannot yet make any statements about when flight operations can be resumed.“Before the JU-Air can start its planes again, various questions would have to be clarified.
Christian Gartmann, media spokesman for the JU-Air, is optimistic that the flight ban will soon be lifted: «We do everything we can to resume flight operations on Easter weekend.»If the Bazl makes new conditions, there could be delays."The interest in flights with the JU-52 is still great," says Gartmann.
«We don't feel that people are still unsettled after the crash.There is still no indications for a technical crash cause.»Around ten percent of the flights already booked have been canceled since late summer.
Another ten percent would have booked back a bought voucher and would fly at a later date.The Ju-52 With the enrollment HB HOS, the usual annual maintenance has been subjected to the HB HOS.In addition, the aircraft cell was examined for corrosion damage with an improved X -ray process.
However, this still had to be calibrated and removed by the supervisory authority.The HB-Hop machine is used again in this late summer at the earliest because it was completely dismantled.It will be overhauled in the coming months.
«This measure is not related to last year's crash.We do this voluntarily so that the JU-52 can fly for another twenty years, »emphasizes Gartmann.In the case of aviation experts, however, doubts grow as to whether the Aunt Ju will be in the air for a long time.
The JU-Air machines procured by the Swiss Air Force in 1939 are among the oldest aircraft in the world with which passenger flights are carried out.Originally, the military vans were only designed for around 150 flight hours.In the meantime, they have around 10,000 flight hours on their hump.
"We know far too little about the inner condition of the planes," explains Holderegger.The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the manufacturer, Junkers Airplane and Motorenwerke AG, was dissolved after the Second World War.So there is no longer a manufacturer that continuously recommendations for the continuous airiness and the maintenance of the JU-52 emissions.
As Holderegger explains, the Bazl cannot take on this role.«For this we needed a staff of our own experts.This is simply not feasible. "Replacement for crashed Ju-52" We believe in our planes, "assures Ju-Air spokesman Gartmann.
In order to be able to use a fleet with three machines again, the plane crashed in August is to be replaced.The JU-Air has caught the eye of the JU-52 with the name HB-Hoy.This has been retired since the end of 2016 and is currently still in a hangar in Mönchengladbach.
However, it is not yet clear when the classic car comes back to Switzerland.So far, the Bazl has not yet granted the Permit of Fly necessary for the transfer flight.The tragic crash of the JU-52 is becoming more and more a turning point for the business with classic car flights, which is very important in Switzerland.
Due to the corrosion damage determined on the Junkers machines, the Bazl checks all classic car aircraft registered in Switzerland.Among them is the Super Constellation, a passenger machine built in 1955, which is operated by the Super Constellation Flyers Association (SCFA) association.The aircraft with the name “Star of Switzerland” was discovered at the end of 2018 on a fore -gear on the right wing.
According to a media release from the SCFA, a complete renovation of the wing is probably essential.The repair is expected to take four years and cost around CHF 10 million.There are also rents for the hangar, costs for mechanics and reserves for unexpected, so that the association has to raise around CHF 20 million.
And this before the start of the repair work.At the beginning of February, the club members decided to work to maintain the last flight -capable Connie.The necessary funds are to be applied in the next three months.
The Bazl cannot currently say when the JU-Air can greet passengers again.Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters interim report follows on the anniversary of the accident.
· Since the day of the crash, the Swiss Security Investigation Center (Sust) has been to clarify the cause."At the moment, we are in the technical area to undergo all critical areas in the wreck, such as elements of controlling a detailed analysis," explains examination manager Daniel W. Knecht at the request of the NZZ.
At the same time, the operation of these aircraft patterns, the training and background of the crew are analyzed and the three -dimensional flight route of the accident aircraft is reconstructed."Since this investigation is characterized by a collaboration of many individual and small information units, numerous new evidence has already been raised," says Aviatik division.Since the beginning of the examination, the Sust has received 200 reports from the population, with about half of these reports contained photos, film recordings or GPS recordings.

From Zurich to Geneva prefer to show new figures on the plane / / mobility, how often domestic flights are used in Switzerland.
And how many tons of CO2 they produce.Mathias Borndie Lufthansa is in the head: the 40-minute flights from Nuremberg to Munich, which is 150 kilometers away, the shortest scheduled flight connection in Germany, is an "ecological and economic absurdity," says the state chairman of the Bavarian Greens according to an agency report.In Switzerland, on the other hand, little is discussed on domestic flights.
Although there are also short distances on the flight schedule in this country.The most important connections are offered by the Lufthansa subsidiary Swiss: the airline flies from Zurich to Geneva and back eight times a day.
Such a flight takes 50 minutes and can currently be booked from CHF 190.The Swiss flies from Zurich to Lugano and back four times a day."As an airline in Switzerland, it is important to us to connect the various parts of the country to our worldwide network at the Zurich Hub," says Meike Fuhlrott, media spokeswoman for Swiss.
The flight from Zurich to Sion, which the Helvetic airline offered on behalf of the Swiss on two Saturdays, is even shorter: it only lasted 40 minutes and was available for CHF 104, so it cost twice as much as the three -hour train ride with half -tax.This flight was intended in advance as a feeder for a connection tailored to winter sports tourists from customs to London.
All three ways can be easily covered by train - if you have a little more seat leather: The trips from Zurich to Geneva, Lugano and customs last between two and a half and three hours.With the plane you are hardly faster at your destination:
If you calculate the time for checking in and wait at the airport, the lead gained will quickly dissolve into air.The railway wins three and a half times as much energy as the railway criterion of ecology:
For a flight from Zurich to Geneva, around three and a half times as much energy is necessary as for the journey on the rail, as can be calculated on the information platform Energiebelt.ch.And the flight is produced 150 times more CO2.If one assumes that around 50 kilograms of CO2 will be generated per passenger on the Zurich - Geneva - 600,000 passengers a year for this route to a total of 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
The same number of passengers produce 180 tons of CO2 with the train.A total of 713,033 passengers were transported in Germany and charter traffic in Germany last year in accordance with the Federal Statistics Office.That is 21 901 less than in 2016 when a 10-year maximum was recorded.
But there are still more distinctive than five years ago: in 2013, the number of domestic passengers was at a low point.At that time, the airlines only transported 593 878 passengers.
The flights from Geneva to Zurich are particularly popular: 316 743 passengers traveled on this route last year;Average 867 a day.If you assume eight connections a day, you get 108 travelers per plane.
Airplanes from the Bombardier C -series are used on this route, such as the Airbus A220 - 300, which depending on the equipment offers 130 to 160 seats.A similar number of people use the flight back from Zurich to Geneva: 305 910 passengers were counted.In total, over 620,000 people used this connection.
It should be almost exclusively Swiss customers.At the airline, one does not want to confirm or deny the calculation.The company also does not provide any information about the profitability of the individual routes.
Media spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott points out that "a large part of the domestic passengers in Zurich will switch to a long -haul flight of the Swiss."Without transfer passengers from Geneva and Lugano, among other things, we could offer significantly fewer intercontinental destinations." The connections between east and west are superior to the other sky high.44 554 flew from Lugano to Zurich last year and 43,766 people from Zurich to Lugano.
Only 595 passengers were on the road between Zurich and Basel.If you look closely, notices: the number of passengers transported on all connections decreased over time - except that between Zurich and Geneva.
In 2018, 17,742 and 5.8 percent more people were transported here than in the previous year and in the opposite direction 13 605 more (plus 4.3 percent). Aviation route Geneva Lugano is orphaned broken landing, however, between Geneva and Lugano: after theSwiss had deleted the unprofitable offer in 2016 from the flight schedule, tried to take over the Darwin Airline, but got into financial imbalance.Then the airline Skywork from Bern tried her luck.
Since this has been bankrupt, the route has been orphaned.In comparison to the number of rail travelers, those of the flight passengers are still small.In 2016, SBB for the Zurich airport stop in 2016 shows a passenger frequency of 47,200 people.
The vast majority of Swiss people still seem to have internalized the SBB advertising slogan from 1958: "The clever travels in the course." More than 620,000 passengers between Zurich and more than 310,000 passengers fly from Geneva to Zurich every year.Photo: Christian Merz (Keystone)

The excessive aircraft / / Jürgen Schellingie 1950s are the era of faith in unlimited progress.
No wonder that a committee was founded by the British government at the end of 1956, which is supposed to probe the possibilities for a very new kind of transport aircraft.The airliner is said to be revolutionary quickly, overhaul is the declared goal.In March 1959, it was decided to start preparing for the construction of a British overs sound passenger plane.
It is quickly clear that the immense development costs of a nation alone cannot be affected.That is why the British are looking for a cooperation option.The suitable partner can be found in neighboring France with its highly developed aircraft industry.
Fifty years ago, on March 2, 1969, the chassis took off an airplane for the first time that the western world has never seen.The French Concorde prototype 001 starts in Toulouse for half-hour flight.Two previously planned appointments had been thwarted by the bad weather.
For safety reasons, the chassis remains extended all the time.The two test pilots and the flight engineer on board do not want to take any risk.The machine rises to just about 3000 meters.
The speed remains modest below 500 km / h.After less than half an hour it is already over.When landing, a brake parachute is triggered after putting on to be on the safe side.
Four weeks later, the British prototype 002 canceled for the first time.Excessive costing March 2, 1969 marked a revolution in aviatics.
Because the joint project still needs seven months before the overs sound speed is achieved in flight testing for the first time, and another six and a half years of development until line use.But from the end of January 1976, the Concorde is the fastest and most modern means of transport in the western world.However, aerospatials and British Aircraft Corporation as well as governments often come to differences both in the development and the production between the companies involved, because the costs are getting out of hand.
Of the hoped -for orders for more than 100 machines, only orders for 16 concorde remain - and they are politically justified by the British and French government.The oil crisis and the lack of overflow permits in some countries because of the noise have almost all other airlines jump off.In addition, the four -jet Boeing 747 also flies significantly slower, but also consumes about a third of the kerosine of a concorde per passenger and kilometers.
Nevertheless, the Concorde serves a niche in aviation for almost three decades.Because a maximum of 2,23 or more than double sound speed, the equivalent of up to 2405 kilometers per hour, only reaches them in civil aircraft in the western world.Her Soviet Airliner counter, which constructed at the same time and also made 2 fast TU-144, only flies one season.
Air France packs a maximum of 92 passengers in the narrow fuselage in the last years of service, and British Airways are up to 100 passengers.British and French concordes can be seen relatively often in Switzerland.When the machine appears on Basel, Geneva or Zurich, it provides spectators a visual and acoustic spectacle.
Because the fuselage tip, which can be landed up to 17 degrees up to 17 degrees, is their unique selling point.Without the adjustable nose, the pilots could not see the runway at all.This innovation has no other western aircraft.
Although the four turbines in the landing approach run without afterburners and only under partial load, they are still extremely loud.Abrupte Endei of the first landing on federal soil on August 31, 1976 in Geneva, thousands of onlooks were feverish.In Zurich Kloten it means waiting.
It was only in August 1998 that an Air France Concorde with an exemption was given to the airport anniversary.Overall, the overs sound airliners are around 20 times in Switzerland, including several times in Geneva, once in Zurich and surprisingly often in Basel-Mulhouse.On July 25, 2000 there will be tragedy.
An Air France Concord rolls over a metal part that was previously lost by an airliner.This slot up a tire.Fragments hit the wing.
A fuel leak is created in one of the tanks, the machine catches fire.During the crash, 109 passengers and crew members die on board and four people on the ground.All Concordes are reinforced.
Nevertheless, there is still a short comeback from autumn 2001 after the tanks are better protected against high -flying parts and reinforced tires.It is one of the last ones, because now the booking figures due to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 are declining.The increasing fuel prices also increase the uneconomics of the concorde.
Therefore, British Airways and Air France will be able to complete all copies by autumn 2003.On November 26, 2003, a Concorde ends up at the former British manufacturer Filton near Bristol.It is at least the preliminary end of the era of civilian overshanging.
On November 26, 2003, the Concorde removed for its last trip.Tim Ockenden / Epaohne lowered nose could not see the pilots the runway.Stephen Hird / Reuters duplicated sound speed, up to 2405 km / h, reached the concorde.

Left -wing also flying to Berlin / / local council.
Six people drove the night train on Wednesday evening, eight flies on Thursday morning.Spicy: Three leftists also take the plane - at least climate compensated.The choice of the means of transport is delicate because Zurich has been committed to the “2000-Watt Society”.
Flights to neighboring countries are not doing well for parliamentarians and urban employees in this context.According to the city council, you should "take a role model".Together with the green Karin Meier-Bohrer, the GL-Pler Matthias Wiesmann, the data protection officer Marcel Studer and Andreas Ammann, head of the parliamentary services, Bürki took the night train at 8:00 p.m. and arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m.
All others take the aircraft today, including the two SVP representatives, the members of legal service and financial control as well as the left Mischa Schiwow (AL), SP city party president Marco Denoth and Mark Richli (SP), the travel plans are confused because the municipal councilMeets Wednesday until 9 p.m.Anyone who took the night train had to rose early."We have a long tendency list, an earlier demolition was not responsible," says President Bürki.
He left the Bock yesterday to his Vice President Heinz Schlatt (SVP). Mark Richli (SP) would have traveled "loved" by train.However, as a secretary of the council, he weighted the functioning of the company higher until 9 p.m.Denoth and Schiwow state that it is not possible for them to go home by train for private reasons - the train journey takes eight and a half hours.
According to the city council, the aircraft should only be used if the train ride takes more than six hours.The Zurich SVP National Councilor Mauro Tuena scolds: "Typical left: against climate change, but fly yourself." Ruedi Baumann

Schimpf and Shame / / by Claudia Wirzda said another that equality has not yet been reached in Switzerland.
In any case, there is tie in aviatic mobility.In other words, women and men fly the same.It is around 9000 kilometers per year and person.
Men and women also in equal parts are responsible for the emissions associated with air travel.This is shown by the 2015 microcensus. However, there is still a small difference between the sexes: the women fly more often out of leisure fun, the men for this a little more often for business reasons.
You could also think about that excellently.But that then led to a completely different topic.Now that it has been clarified that there is no blatantly "better" gender for once flight behavior, a look at the generation question is obvious.
In view of the trendy student strikes for climate protection, one almost thinks that the youthful concern for the environment would also be reflected in their own consumption.But students are just people.And what applies to the old therefore also applies to the boys:
The spirit is willing, but the meat is weak.So the Bible should be right again.The 18- to 24-year-olds are true master flyers.
No other Swiss age group - and certainly not the one from 65 - frequently on the plane for leisure trips like the young adults.Between 2010 and 2015, the average number of air travel per person increased by 43 percent.The concern for the environment and the combat slogans from the Klimemo are apparently quickly forgotten when it comes to your own holiday fun or your own well -deserved world tour.
Admittedly, these numbers are not entirely new.But actually this finding is not really surprising today.The young people demonstrators are not only good to displace their own debt, but also to delegate responsibility.
Her slogans are often in the imperative.And they basically make demands to the others.To the adults and politics and the corporations.
Nevertheless, the criticized - especially the politicians - are entirely enthusiastic about the youthful vigor and like to sunbathe in this hopeful light.Finally a politicized youth, it is said.The German Minister of Justice Katarina Barley (SPD) is so full of praise that she even thought these days even said that the age of voting was to be reduced to 16.
This demand has been haunted again and again in Switzerland for years.But is the youth beyond political show fights and organized mega events really politicized that they would work in the conventional, supposedly boring policy with the same furor?Doubts are at least allowed.
In any case, the last comprehensive Swiss youth survey of 2017 gave completely different insights into the mood of the young generation.Friends, leisure and family are more important to them than politics or God, wrote the authors of the study.Getting married, getting children and a retreat to private - at least a few years ago it was quite popular with the Swiss youth.
The voting participation of young adults confirms this finding.Unlike in flight statistics, the 18- to 24-year-olds notice above average abstinence.Perhaps the boys should just fly less with the climate, if they are serious and vote more often.

The chauffeur turned his eyes into the lake incredulously instead of on the road.He had to make sure twice: did he really see an airplane on the lake?
In fact: Charged on a pontoon boat, of course, a Bombardier CL-604 swam over the water.In Alpnach, the 12 -ton machine with a wing span with a wing span 20 meters was lifted off the truck half an hour earlier and loaded onto the ship.At walking pace, the ferry then chopped over the lake with its unusual freight - in the middle of the tranquil mountain backdrop of Central Switzerland.
It is not an ordinary aircraft that was on the road here, but a worthy old lady who has already saved countless people's life: a rega outpatient aircraft, which was a proud 16 years.With a good 20,000 flight hours and over 4,400 patients transported, this plane has a considerable balance.In October 2018, the machine was discarded, prepared and prepared for its second life.
The plane is said to come to the Lucerne traffic center as an exhibition object, where it will be accessible to the public from mid -April 2019.Hope for a stable weather, the last trip to the museum began in the early morning under the eyes of numerous journalists with a loading on the ship.Bruno Bucher from the responsible logistics company said that an aircraft transport is of course not an everyday project.
And his colleague Thomas Walker from the company, who was responsible for the crossing, was a little concern: “We just hope that the weather will remain stable.»It is also open how close you can go to the shore in Lucerne, it has shallows.The laying down worked smoothly.
With the rather low Achereggbrücke near Stansstad, the first test was followed than was to ship the aircraft.«Do we have enough space?“, Bruno Bucher - who stood like a cowboy on the back of the aircraft - called half seriously, half jokingly the onlookers standing on the bank.It was actually scarce, but it was just enough.
Bucher made a happy Juchzer easier.Many Swiss do not know that the Rega not only has rescue helicopters, but also three outpatient shelves for so -called repatriations of people who have been incurred abroad or seriously ill.Thanks to technical progress in aviatics, but also in medicine, such outpatient clinic jets can now be equipped with medical devices - such as a flying intensive care unit - and up to four patients.
Together with operations managers, rega consultants decide on the need, time and type of repatriation: Sometimes accompanied transport in a scheduled aircraft is enough, but sometimes it takes the outpatient clinic jet.Depending on the length of the use, the Rega crew includes between two and four pilots, an flight doctor and an intensive care person.
For example, Rega was happy for her jets in 2004 at the tsunami in Southeast Asia when it attributed more than sixty patients to Switzerland within a week.But there are always special transports, for example in premature babies in the incubator or in patients who are connected to cardiovascular devices.In 2015, a patient with suspicion of Sierra Leone was flown out on board the Challenger CL-604, under the highest safety precautions and isolated in a special insulation box that was used for the first time on this flight.
Last year the Rega flew a total of 980 missions with its three outpatient jets.Around 10 a.m., the aircraft ship in Lucerne slowly approached the bank.The spectators gathered on the narrow ship's stitch.
Everyone stretched their heads up when a Rega helicopter appeared in the sky, which made a few rounds of honor over the aircraft ship.Yes, traffic fans really got their money's worth here!Thanks to the high water level, the pontoon could drive almost to the shore.
With the flying virus, the girts were put on when the plane was put on and the crane raised it again, but turned the weather: the wind and rain called the workers who had to put their threatening cargo past the bank trees.It looked spectacular.An older woman among the spectators regrettably complained:
«I don't have my cell phone with me today!“She was probably the only one who hadn't pulled out her device.The maneuver also watched Urs Nagel, the head pilot of the Rega Jet fleet.
Last weekend he was still in action in Thailand with one of the newly purchased jets from the successor model Challenger CL-650.Now he looked at his tedious plane, as - almost himself a patient - was carefully loaded onto the truck in order to cover his last meters to the traffic house. "Yes, wistful is already there," he said that with this plane he was several hundredHours flown to many countries, some memorable commitment was there.As a rega pilot, he is already responsible, said Nagel, because as a pilot, he knows the patient's condition on board.
Sometimes relatives would also fly along.Complications on the flight are not excluded.It has already happened that patients died during the flight.
«But I experience my work as very meaningful.»Nagel was air force pilot, then at Swissair, after grounding he switched to Rega.«I find it particularly nice that we were now able to put our plane to the traffic center.
This is how it is given to the public.I was very often in the traffic house myself as a child and then climbed around the Coronado enthusiastically, »said Nagel.«There I infected myself with the flight virus.

The new Boeing 737 - a security risk?/ / The 737 is the evergreen of the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing.The crashed model is a further development of older machines.
Andreas Spaethzu at the beginning of this decade Boeing saw himself in a dilemma: the airlines called for a more economical, more modern aircraft for short and medium-haul routes.
Boeing only offered the 737 Evergreen.The 737 is the classic commercial aircraft for typical racetracks of up to a few hours, for over 50 years.The first two -spoter from Seattle went to the line service at Lufthansa in February 1968 and was able to promote around a hundred passengers.
Boeing was ahead for decades, long before Airbus came onto the market 20 years later with the A320 competitive model.Until the beginning of 2019, Boeing from the 737, by far the most widespread transport aircraft of the Jet era, had delivered almost 10,500 pieces.Again and again new, modernized and improved versions have been launched over the decades.
But almost ten years ago, the end of the possibilities seemed.With the offer of a revised version of the A320, Airbus was pretended with new engines and achieved huge sales success with the A320neo.Boeing was under pressure.
The dilemma was little efficiency and there was exactly: Unlike the A320, under which greater engines could also be hanged without major new structures, this was not easily possible with the Boeing 737, whose wings hang deeper above the ground.The airlines demanded completely new short -haul aircraft from the manufacturers anyway.
But Airbus and Boeing refused, because a completely new draft would have devoured double -digit billions of billions without bringing the necessary quantum leap when gaining efficiency, which might have made such investments worthwhile.In addition, Airbus and Boeing were already tied to capital and resources in the development of their new long -distance jets A350 and 787.Therefore, Boeing was forced to compromise and to construct them in its core decades 737.
In order to hang the LEAP engines from CFM with their diameter of around 1 meter 80 under the wings, for example, the gear was extended by 20 centimeters so that there is still enough distance from the floor.At the same time, the new engines must continue to hang in front of the wings than previous 737 engines.This in turn changes the aerodynamics of the aircraft.
This is where the problem begins to lower the nose and the new engine arrangement.In the worst case, this can lead to the flow demolition, i.e. to the absence of buoyancy and then to the crash.
In order to automatically compensate for this problem, Boeing has installed a system called MCAS (MANUVERING Characteristics Augmentation System), which automatically lowers the nose when a critical flight situation is recognized in order to escape a flow of stream.However, Boeing initially refrained from communicating this innovation to the pilots completely and incorporating them in their training for the new pattern.For this reason, the pilots of the Indonesian Lion Air fought a minute -long struggle with their machine in October 2018 after the start of Jakarta without knowledge of this system, which apparently incorrectly repeatedly lowered their nose, while the pilots were manually held and sought to win.
The end was tragic, the 737 Max 8 fell into Lake Java, all 189 inmates died.Subsequently, pilot associations criticized Boeing's lack of communication worldwide, and the accident examination continues.When crashing in Ethiopia, such a struggle with the aircraft's up and down movements is not recognizable after data available so far.
It is still unclear whether there was a comparable or other technical problem or whether the cause is in no direct connection with the aircraft type and its properties.The nature of the crash point indicates a frontal impact on the ground with the nose, since there are no larger individual parts and the plane has torn a deep crater into the ground.Either way, the second 737 Max 8 crash is a heavy blow to Boeing and the largest security crisis since the Boeing 787 Grounding Grounding six years ago.
The company canceled the ceremonial unveiling of its new long -distance jet 777x last night.Around 350 Jets of the 737 Max 8 Jets are currently flying worldwide, the largest operator is Southwest Airlines in the USA.Over 5110 copies of the type are ordered.
In Europe, the largest operators are currently Norwegian, Tui and Turkish Airlines. «Reflexes», page 38Boing 737 Max 8 is rarely in Switzerland.·
Of the Boeing aircraft that regularly fly to Zurich Airport, none is part of the 737 Max model type. Nevertheless, it has occurred sporadically in the past few months that machines of this type landed in Zurich.The airlines Turkish Airlines and Lot use them on two flight routes, but mostly other models are used.However, it happens that the Boeing 737 Max 8 takes over a flight, for example because of the size of the machine.
It is similar at the Geneva Airport: no Boeing 737 Max 8 flies regularly to Cointrin.However, it can happen sporadically that an airline carries out a flight with this machine at short notice.
However, no such flights are currently planned.Airlines that regularly operate Zurich use the model - and you cannot exclude that they also fall back on it to fly to Zurich.Boeing machines are generally only weakly represented in Zurich.
Airbus machines fly to Zurich in particular.With a share of over 60 percent of the line and charter flights that land in Zurich, Airbus was in place in 2017 with a large distance.Embraer is even more stronger than Boeing.
Smaller shares also have Fokker and British Aerospace / Avro.Airlines that fly to Switzerland and have the 737 Max 8 model include American Airlines and Air Canada with 24 machines, Norwegian Air Shuttle with 18 aircraft, the TUI Group and Air China, each with 15, Turkish Airlines andThe Hainan Airlines with 11 each, smartwings with 7, the lot with 5, the ethiopian airlines with 4 and Royal Air Maroc with 2 aircraft.378 Boeing Max 8 are currently in use worldwide.
Boeing delivered 256 of the Max 7, 8, 9 or 10 variants last year.Helper mountains the remains of the crashed machine at Bishoftu.Mulugea
Ayene / apple finish remain on the flooring · In the accident, all 149 passengers and 8 crew members died on Sunday.
According to the airline, 32 Kenyanians, 18 Canadians, 9 Ethiopians, 8 Americans, Italians and Chinese as well as 5 Germans were among other things.According to previous knowledge, Swiss were not on board.According to the United Nations, at least 21 employees of the United Nations were among the victims.
Experts found the two black boxes on Monday, as the Reuters news agency reported, citing state television.The relatively new aircraft type Boeing 737 Max 8 must remain on the ground in some countries after the machine crashed at Addis Ababa.China and Indonesia explained a starting ban for all aircraft of the same type of construction.
The airlines Ethiopian, Mongolian, Cayman Airways and Royal Air Maroc also leave their max machines on the ground.At least 110 aircraft are affected.However, American airlines such as United and Southwest want to continue their jets-as well as the Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian, the largest max operator in Europe so far.
An American government representative said that the Boeing 737 Max security record in the USA was brilliant.The world's largest travel group TUI is still checking what to do.His fleet already includes 15 jets of this type, which are used in Great Britain and the Benelux countries.
The crash and the grounding for machines of the Boeing 737 Max machines imposed in several countries put the American aircraft manufacturer under pressure on the stock exchanges.In Frankfurt, the Boeing shares in value.In the United States, the American aircraft manufacturer's share price collapsed by almost 13.5 percent at the start of the trade.

Crash after crash / after the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines machine with 157 dead, the McAS software on the radar of the investigator sandrea Cattaninur six minutes after the start in the Ethiopian capital Addis Abba broke the radio contact to flight ET 302 to Nairobi
away .The crew had dropped an emergency call and even received the release for return.
But it was already too late for the 149 passengers and eight crew members.All died.The same type of aircraft from Boeing falls from heaven twice within just five months.
A built -in protection system in the cockpit is discussed.It should ensure more security - and may now be responsible for the death of 157 people: the MANUVERING Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS for short), a computer -aided control system, has been criticized by the staff for a long time.
Has the pilots overwhelmed in the Cockpit of the Ethiopian Airlines?The MCAS is always used for Boeing pilot 737 Max when the sensors of the aircraft register an impending flow of flow.In such cases, the protective system automatically intervenes and trims the nose of the machine down.
The assistant in the Boeing cockpits has not been unproblematic since the introduction.In the past, pilots of several airlines complained that they had known nothing of the MCAS and were therefore surprised by the automatic intervention of the computer while they were flight.Also in the preliminary report on the crash of a Boeing 737 Max of the low -cost provider Lion Air last October off the coast of Indonesia, there is a lot of indication that the pilots on board were overwhelmed with the MCAS.
They fought against the automatically initiated descent 26 times.In the end, the machine smashed.189 people died.
The American aviation supervision warned early on the dangers of the MCAS.In maneuvers, there could be "difficulties in controlling, excessive descent position, severe height loss and soil collisions".Mary Schiavo, the ex-general inspector of the U.S. Transport Ministry, plus: “We have a brand new aircraft here that crashes twice within a year.
That just can't happen!»Boeing had reacted to Indonesia after the crash and, using circulars, had again instructed the pilots into the software of the 737-Max models.Aviatik expert Sepp Moser (73) actually sees a comfort improvement for pilots in the MCAS.
“At the moment, however, there is a lot of indication that the system had played a role at least for one of the Boeing crashs."He suspects the error devil when interaction with the autopilot:" These are finesse that must be coordinated here.
It is quite possible that errors may have crept in with the complex data. »Ruant clusters have the fragments of the crashed Boeing 737 Max together.Crash site with an excavator yesterday is tidy at the scene near Addis Ababa.
Mourning in Addis Ababa is commemorated by the late crew members of the accident.Many UN employees and development workers on board were on the way to fight for a better world:
At least 19 UN employees and development workers died in Ethiopia when the Boeing 737 Max crashed.The employees worked for different UN organizations, such as for the world nutrition program, the refugee agency, the environmental program, the World Bank, the UNESCO and the international telecommunications union.Michael Ryan from Ireland died among others.
He was one of seven from the world nutrition program that sat in the machine.Sarah Affret († 29), an expert in polar tourism, also died in the plane crash.She was on the way to Nairobi to talk about fighting the pollution of the world's oceans.
Karoline Aadland († 28) from the Norwegian Red Cross also died.The development assistant was on the way to Burundi.The victims also include Norman Tendis (51), an Austrian pastor who was on behalf of the World Church Council.
He leaves a woman and three children.As a sign of grief for their employees, the United Nations set their flags on half mast yesterday.There was a minute's silence at the UN seat in Geneva.
UN Secretary General António Guterres expressed his condolences to the relatives of the victims.The misfortune makes him "deeply sad". Laut of the airline Ethiopian Airlines were among other 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight Americans, Italians and Chinese as well as five Germans and three Austrians.The flag at the UN building in New York is on half mast.
Anyone who flies the Boeing 737 Max, who is now the second death drama of a Boeing machine have pulled several airlines and no longer let their airs of type 737 Max up to the air.In addition to the Caribbean Cayman Airways, the Ethiopian Airlines are also included.The machine crashed on Sunday belonged to the East African airline.
The Chinese and Indonesian aviation authorities have also issued a temporary flight ban on machines in the 737 Max model.As long as the cause of the accident has not been resolved after the crash in Ethiopia, the aircraft type in the corresponding countries may no longer be lifted.In Europe, however, the plane remains in operation with several airlines.
They include Norwegian Air, Icelandair, Air Italy, the Polish Lot and Turkish Airlines.So far, Swiss has no Boeing 737 Max in its fleet.Lot and Turkish also fly to Switzerland with the Boeing 737 Max.
So far, Georg Nopperdie Swiss has no Boeing 737 Max in her fleet.Boeing's flagship wastewater The first Boeing models of the new type 737 Max went into the air in 2017.The machines are the counterpart of the US aircraft manufacturer to the A320 from Airbus.
The planes are a new edition of the Boeing 737, which have been built since the 1960s.The Americans primarily want to score with more space and more economical engines.The machines offer space for 138 passengers in the smallest version and are typically used for rather short distances.
For Boeing, the series with two crashed Max 8 aircraft is a massive image damage.In China, the plane is no longer allowed to take off until further notice.Boeing wanted to invest particularly there in the future.

Boeing after falling into a shortage of explanation / / flight industry from the brand new machine 737
Max 8 depends on the future of the largest US industrial group.But after two inexplicable accidents, this is an option.Walter Niederbergersan Franciscoder The first crash of a Boeing 737 Max Last October could be explained with the problems of a small, unreliable society, the Indonesian Lion Air.
But the misfortune of the Ethiopian Airlines is really threatening for US companies: the largest African airline is considered safe, and the machine was controlled by an experienced pilot.The cause is still unclear.
Eyewitnesses at the scene of the accident near Addis Abeba reported that the machine had caught fire from the crash, but only the evaluation of the two black boxes should make certainty.The crash of a brand new machine shortly after the start throws a shadow on the growth strategy by Dennis Muilenberg.The 55-year-old CEO had taken over the cumbersome company in 2015 and immediately prescribed a savings program that fell victim to several tens of thousands of employees.
The program also felt the suppliers in the form of hard price reductions.A third of the profit internationally made Muilenberg Rauchen names.The Boeing boss is a nationalistic bully, said Airbus boss Tom Enders, who "ruthlessly diversions on the America-First wave".
Muilenberg is a Trump supporter and openly explains that he has a say in the trade dispute between the USA and China.The upcoming delivery of 737-Max-8 machines to Chinese airlines could also be used as a negotiating mass for a compromise.Boeing recently opened a work and calculated damit in China that 43,000 traffic machines will be needed worldwide for the next 20 years, almost a fifth of it in China.
With Airbus, Boeing provides a gigantic competition in which Chinese manufacturers will also be switched on shortly.Like the A320 Neo from Airbus, the 737-max models for needs of emerging countries were developed according to a reliable medium-distance machine.A 737 costs around $ 120 million.
These jets contribute around a third to the group profit and form the foundation for Boeing's financial security in the coming years.The grounding of the 737-max machines in China and Indonesia, two of the group's most important customers, appears accordingly scary.Grounding in China clearly increases the pressure on Muilenberg, explains Richard Aboulafia, Vice President of the Aviation Consulting Firma Teal Group.
Boeing must now quickly and convincingly demonstrate the security of the 737-Max jets, otherwise "suffer sales and image quickly". The Boeing papers initially crashed by up to 13 percent on Monday morning before the lossaround 7 percent stabilized.In addition to the high-tech companies, Boeing is the largest support in the US stock market.The Boeing share has increased by around 300 percent since 2015 and contributed around 30 percent to the increase of Dow Jones.
Boeing has replaced the former giant General Electric as the largest American industrial group and is now also the country's largest export company.Thousands of suppliers depend on what Boeing gives a comparably important turntable function like the auto industry in Germany.According to Muilenberg, the 737 max machines are deliberately designed in such a way that the pilots need little retraining and that the airlines do not have to invest valuable time in training.
Boeing vehemently defended the model against the criticism of pilots after the first crash in October and insisted that the machines were in flight like the previous proven 737 models, of which more than 10,000 were delivered worldwide.Course The Boeing Aktie sales strike and problem child: engine of a 737 Max on the Boeing workshop in Trenton, Washington.Photo: Getty Imagesda's accident aircraft is also in Europe in the operational after the two crashes, experts criticize the new Boeing 737 max 8 aircraft.
According to the news portal “CH-Aviation”, around 380 of the new machines are flying worldwide.The US airline Southwest, Air Canada, American Airlines and Chinese airlines are used the most.In Europe, nine airlines have the Boeing 737 Max in its fleet.
Turkish Airlines flies the airports in Basel and Zurich with its eleven machines, but this is irregular.Norwegian flies through various subsidiaries with around twenty 737 their customers from A to B. The planes stayed in action, says a spokesman.
The well -known German holiday pilot TUI also works over various partner airlines 15 of the aircraft.IcelandAir has ordered 16 machines and already used five.At the Icelandic airline it is said that it is currently refraining from pulling the planes out of circulation.
At the Italian airline Air Italy, the Boeings have been in operation since May last year, and the Italians are currently flying with three types of machines.The Swiss does not use 737 Max.(PHF) "There are troubling parallels between the two crashes"
For the second time within a few months, a new Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed shortly after the start.Would you still get into such a machine as an expert?I would certainly have a queasy feeling.
It is exceptional that there is two crashes in such a short time with a completely new aircraft model.Individual childhood diseases are common, which are then corrected step by step.Are the crashes a coincidence?
Or is there more behind it?It is too early to be able to say.There are troubling parallels:
Both crashes happened a few minutes after the start.And with both it was a brand new machine.But there are also differences:
At the Indonesian low -cost airline Lion Air, the plane was repaired the evening before because the pilots of the previous flight said something was wrong.According to the preliminary investigation report, a part was not replaced correctly.This means that the machine was not operational.
There was no complaint from the pilots and mechanics for the Ethiopian Airlines machine.There were also no problems with the previous flight.China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have banned the use of the Boeing 737 Max 8.
Is that exaggerated, or does the entire fleet have to be opened worldwide?If you want to have absolute security immediately, that's a valable option.However, it is a significant interference with the freedom of the airlines and Boeing.
You don't know yet whether it is really because of the plane itself or whether it was human mistakes.How long will it go for the causes of the two crashes to be determined?Usually there is a first report after a month, which shows in basic features what happened.
About a year after the accident, there is a comprehensive report.It can take years until the final report.In this case, in this case, where there is a high pressure on Boeing and the authorities, you will try to say more in a month.
It is examined whether new software is responsible for the crashes.Are there any information?There were actually abnormalities in the Lion-Air crash.
The pilots were not or too little informed of how the system reacts.If you knew it, you could have turned it off.Because of their lack of knowledge, they tried to overlook the system again and again, but this did not succeed.
Pilots accuse Boeing of introducing the system without training and even deliberately kept secret from the airlines.Is this accusation correct?You can't say whether it was aware of it yet.
There are contradictory statements.Boeing says that this happened in consultation with the authorities because the system was perceived as too little relevant.And Boeing says the new system is mentioned in the pilot manual.
However, there was no active information from the pilots.Peter Burkhardtstefan Eiselin The Aviatik expert is editor-in-chief of the Aerotelegraph Aviation News Portal.

Boeing must now quickly and convincingly demonstrate the security of the 737-Max jets, otherwise "suffer sales and image quickly". The Boeing papers initially crashed by up to 13 percent on Monday morning before the lossaround 7 percent stabilized.In addition to the high-tech companies, Boeing is the largest support in the US stock market.The Boeing share has increased by around 300 percent since 2015 and contributed around 30 percent to the increase of Dow Jones.
Boeing has replaced the former giant General Electric as the largest American industrial group and is now also the country's largest export company.Thousands of suppliers depend on what Boeing gives a comparably important turntable function like the auto industry in Germany.According to Muilenberg, the 737 max machines are deliberately designed in such a way that the pilots need little retraining and that the airlines do not have to invest valuable time in training.
Boeing vehemently defended the model against the criticism of pilots after the first crash in October and insisted that the machines were in flight like the previous proven 737 models, of which more than 10,000 were delivered worldwide.Course The Boeing Aktie sales strike and problem child: engine of a 737 Max on the Boeing workshop in Trenton, Washington.Photo: Getty Imagesda's accident aircraft is also in Europe in the operational after the two crashes, experts criticize the new Boeing 737 max 8 aircraft.
According to the news portal “CH-Aviation”, around 380 of the new machines are flying worldwide.The US airline Southwest, Air Canada, American Airlines and Chinese airlines are used the most.In Europe, nine airlines have the Boeing 737 Max in its fleet.
Turkish Airlines flies the airports in Basel and Zurich with its eleven machines, but this is irregular.Norwegian flies through various subsidiaries with around twenty 737 their customers from A to B. The planes stayed in action, says a spokesman.
The well -known German holiday pilot TUI also works over various partner airlines 15 of the aircraft.IcelandAir has ordered 16 machines and already used five.At the Icelandic airline it is said that it is currently refraining from pulling the planes out of circulation.
At the Italian airline Air Italy, the Boeings have been in operation since May last year, and the Italians are currently flying with three types of machines.The Swiss does not use 737 Max.(PHF) "There are troubling parallels between the two crashes"
For the second time within a few months, a new Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed shortly after the start.Would you still get into such a machine as an expert?I would certainly have a queasy feeling.
It is exceptional that there is two crashes in such a short time with a completely new aircraft model.Individual childhood diseases are common, which are then corrected step by step.Are the crashes a coincidence?
Or is there more behind it?It is too early to be able to say.There are troubling parallels:
Both crashes happened a few minutes after the start.And with both it was a brand new machine.But there are also differences:
At the Indonesian low -cost airline Lion Air, the plane was repaired the evening before because the pilots of the previous flight said something was wrong.According to the preliminary investigation report, a part was not replaced correctly.This means that the machine was not operational.
There was no complaint from the pilots and mechanics for the Ethiopian Airlines machine.There were also no problems with the previous flight.China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have banned the use of the Boeing 737 Max 8.
Is that exaggerated, or does the entire fleet have to be opened worldwide?If you want to have absolute security immediately, that's a valable option.However, it is a significant interference with the freedom of the airlines and Boeing.
You don't know yet whether it is really because of the plane itself or whether it was human mistakes.How long will it go for the causes of the two crashes to be determined?Usually there is a first report after a month, which shows in basic features what happened.
About a year after the accident, there is a comprehensive report.It can take years until the final report.I assume that in this case, where there is high pressure on Boeing and the authorities, you will try to say more in a month.
It is examined whether new software is responsible for the crashes.Are there any information?There were actually abnormalities in the Lion-Air crash.
The pilots were not or too little informed of how the system reacts.If you knew it, you could have turned it off.Because of their lack of knowledge, they tried to overlook the system again and again, but this did not succeed.
Pilots accuse Boeing of introducing the system without training and even deliberately kept secret from the airlines.Is this accusation correct?You can't say whether it was aware of it yet.
There are contradictory statements.Boeing says that this happened in consultation with the authorities because the system was perceived as too little relevant.And Boeing says the new system is mentioned in the pilot manual.
However, there was no active information from the pilots.Peter Burkhardtstefan Eiselin The Aviatik expert is editor-in-chief of the Aerotelegraph Aviation News Portal.

Zurich AG Airport is still going dazzling / / Zurich Airport expects a slowdown in the increase in passenger in the current year.It is still unclear how much the fees will be reduced in 2020.
Werner Enzverkehr Minister Simonetta Sommaruga and the overall Federal Council as a decision -making body are expected to make a delicate decision in late summer when the new airport fees are determined.Stephan Widrig, the chairman of the management of Zurich AG Airport AG, appealed to the state government at the balance sheet media conference to make a balanced decision in the economic question.As is well known, the course of the airport share had broken down greatly last November after the Federal Office for Civil Aviation (BAZL) had promised a strong reduction in passenger fees.
Against the BAZL billing the airport leadership has never stood against a reduction in fees per se, but it defends itself against two concrete points.First of all, the BAZL wants the Zurich AG Airport AG 50 percent instead of 30 percent of the economic added value and 75 percent instead of 30 percent of the parking garage yields to the flight business.That would give more air for the targeted reduction in fees.
And secondly, you are in the hair in terms of the capital costs for operating and, above all, renewing the airport infrastructure.Argued that the passenger fees would be in European midfield despite the very high wage and construction costs in Switzerland.Compared to Frankfurt and Munich- two strategically important airports of the Zurich Grand Customer Lufthansa / Swiss- the performance package, including the starting and landing fees, even significantly cheaper.
In any case, some tricky homework will be solved in Zurich in the future with regard to expansion of capacity and noise protection.After the passenger record in 2018, which brought an increase of 5.8 percent to 31.1 million customers, this year will be expected with an growth rate of 3 percent.However, the observer sometimes creeps up that, like finance Minister Ueli Maurer, the airport has struggled to correctly assess the dynamics.
The increase in passenger and state revenues have been regularly conservative in the recent past.In 2018, the airport's coffers ring the robust demand for flights.The decline of the EBITDA by 2 percent must be relativized because the invoice before taxes was loaded for the extended soundproofing program.
It is to be kept in mind that a Swissair special dividend of CHF 4.8 million and input tax profits of CHF 36.3 million flowed from the sale of Bangalore Airport in 2017.In the flight business (regulated area), Zurich Airport increased the company's profit by 26 percent to CHF 177.2 million.It is obvious that the airport has grown wings in the past two or three years of age, which the Bazl wants to suck something now.
One of several uncertainties is how many millions of airport one day to compensate for noise and residents' protection will have to pay.The noise fund was alimented with CHF 400 million at the end of the year, of which 249 million were already agreed.In the commercial business, things also ran round: Duty-Free and the restaurants made it possible to grow sales of almost 8 percent.
With the takeover in Florianópolis (Brazil), sales in international business multiplied to CHF 83 million, but that was only the beginning.With a total of CHF 290 million, the investments were above the long -term average.Airport in Zurich in MIO MIT (IFRS) 20172018 ± % turnover 11037115311AVIAGE6246575NON-APRAGHTS413496204571–2EBITDA margin ( %) 56.349.5–17 7.75–17 dividend (CHF) 6.506.90 26 -employee196720331

Another German special path / / Marco Seliger was a show when the Dutch Air Force in Texas accepted its first f-35A Lightning II fighter plane from the manufacturer Lockheed Martin at the end of January.Amsterdam disc jockeys sent pulsating electrical beats by the aircraft hangar when the machine was handed over.
It has always been the ambition of the Dutch to fly in the Champions League of the air forces, said Lieutenant General Dennis Luyt, the Commander of the Air Force.This is possible with the F-35.About two weeks later, the German FDP asked in the Bundestag which model the Bundeswehr wanted to procure the fighter bombers Tornado as the successor to the elderly.
Representatives of the German Air Force had favored the F-35 for a long time, since they also wanted to fly in the “Champions League”.The government representative, however, let the dream burst.The Ministry of Defense, he said, decided to examine the Eurofighter and the F-18 as options instead.
Lobby work of the industrial work The most important task of the Tornado developed in the 1970s is to bring the atomic bombs B-61 stored in Büchel in Rhineland-Palatinate.With the so -called nuclear participation, Germany secures a say in the planning group that is responsible for the American nuclear weapons in NATO.This includes that it has the technical requirements for the use of nuclear weapons - such as suitable aircraft or carrier missiles - and is stored on its territory nuclear weapons.
In the search for a corresponding aircraft, an argument broke out in Berlin, as the Greens' defense expert, Tobias Lindner, had never experienced.From Lockheed Martin to Airbus to the French government, all sides in this billion-dollar betting dispute have been unusually aggressive."It is clear to everyone that they only have a shot," says Lindner.
«After that, there will be no project of this size in Germany in the next thirty years.»At first glance, this project does not have to do so much with the successor to the Tornado, but extends far beyond.It exists in Germany under the term “Future Combat Air System” (FCAS).
This is a network of fighter jets, drones, sensors, satellites, tanker, ships and vehicles.The combat aircraft is a kind of flying command station, the task of which is to process the flood of sensor data.Because the complexity of this task would overwhelm a crew, the overall system is largely controlled by algorithms and artificial intelligence.
Only the use of weapons should continue to be left to the pilot.The development costs are estimated at around 80 to 100 billion euros.Strategic meaning
FCAS is one of the most ambitious European procurement programs of the 21st century.Germany and France want to replace Mirage and the Eurofighter in two to three decades.The previous competitors Airbus and Dassault should work together.
No other armaments project of the coming decades has as great strategic importance for the two countries as this.It is not just about an airplane, but about the development of future technologies such as artificial intelligence.That is why the Future Combat Air System has to do with the tornado succession at second glance.
Because the F-35 as the successor to the Tornado might have prevented the project.It took a good four decades to develop and build the camouflage bomber.Like the FCAS, the F-35 is also created as a mobile command station, which is networked with other weapon systems.
The fears of the French government, Dassault and Airbus, were that the procurement of the F-35 by the Bundeswehr could lead to the realization in Germany that the billion-dollar German-French system was superfluous.Why buy a fifth generation fifth aircraft in twenty to thirty years if you can already have one?Therefore, her endeavor to prevent Berlin's decision in favor of the F-35.
Last autumn, several members of the Bundestag reported, a lobbying used previously unknown extent.Dassault opened an office in Berlin and sent a former military attaché to the German capital as chief lobbyist.French parliamentarians made calls with their German colleagues, and the Elysée Palace asked several times in the Chancellery about the status of decision-making.
Meanwhile, Airbus sent its representatives of interest to the Ministry of Defense, where the company is well networked.From the Department of Department in Berlin, it was not so much the technical skills that speak for the F-35.These are state -of -the -art, but are not incontestable.
The American jet suffers from “teething problems”, for example with the software.In addition, his stealth properties, which make it invisible to defense, are questioned by the new development of the passive radar.After all, the bomb shaft is too small to be able to absorb the atomic bombs stored in Büchel.
The B-61 bombs would therefore have to be attached to the wings, which increased the radar cross section of the jet.What speaks clearly for the F-35, on the other hand, is their future spread in the air fleet of important European allies.In a good ten years, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Turkey and Belgium would have obtained more than 500 machines.
The F-35 will form the backbone of the NATO air forces for decades.Allianz's declared goal is to harmonize their armed forces more.With the cancellation to the F-35, Germany is scouring out of this project.
That was, as can be heard in Berlin, not at the Ministry of Defense, but at the Chancellery.Angela Merkel were more important to Franco-German relationships than NATO's efforts to harmonize.Boeing and Airbus have now asked a zero-decision ministry to specify their offer for the tornado successor.
According to reports, Berlin wants to order 40 to 45 machines, which are primarily intended to secure the “nuclear participation”.Boeing goes into the race with the completely renewed version of his aircraft developed in the 1970s, the F / A-18 “Super Hornet”, while Airbus offers an almost fully modified version of the Eurofighter.
Both are fourth generation fighter jets.In Berlin it says that Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen wants to make her choice by the end of the year.But it could also be that there is no decision at all.
The SPD leader Andrea Nahles allegedly would like to delay the decision on Tornado succession until the next Bundestag election in 2021.After that, a government without SPD participation would probably have to make the selection.The Social Democrats could then be on the sidelines and point to the others in the politically controversial nuclear weapons question.
Marco Seliger is editor -in -chief of “Loyal - The Magazine for Security Policy” in Frankfurt.Of the US fighter aircraft F / A-18 and F-35, Berlin only wants to examine the latter, less modern jet.M. Dodge /

Trump prohibits use of the accident aircraft / / aviation The US Air Travel Authority has long hesitated to block the Boeing 737 Max.
Instead, the President intervened last night.Shortly afterwards, manufacturer Boeing decided that all machines in the type in question should remain on the ground worldwide.
Philipp Felbernach long hesitation made the USA last night and imposed a flight ban on Boeing machines of type 737 Max 8 and Max 9. US President Donald Trump provided a corresponding instruction to all airlines after two types of aircraft have collapsed within five monthsand a total of 346 people died.
Trump said the US Air Faa would arrange the starting ban.The order applies now.According to the US media, a phone call between Trump and Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg had previously taken place.
As the “New York Times” reported, Muilenburg near Trump advertised not to remove the approval for the aircraft - apparently in vain.Shortly after Trump's arrangement, the group also reacted and recommended that all types of type - 371 aircraft worldwide - should remain on the ground.
Previously, the European flight authority, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Oman, Australia, South Korea and Canada imposed a flight ban for the 737 Max.But the US flight authority Faa hesitated to block the aircraft type.With her decision she was almost alone.
The fact that she did not act on her own is that she had classified the plane as safe and approved.Now admitting that you lay wrong would have been a bitter blow for the authority.However, an industrial policy move to protect Boeing was not to be assumed.
The Boeing 787 Grounding Grounding through the FAA around six years ago shows that the US authority does not deal with the aircraft manufacturer at home.In addition, the FAA is strictly concerned with approvals.The competition from China is still far from it that Boeing, as the largest export company, is very important for the US economy.
A corresponding major effects should have a decision against the aircraft.The Boeing 737 Max was to secure the supremacy in aviation for the next few years.Boeing and the European competitor Airbus primarily divide the business with civil aircraft.
Behind it are manufacturers such as the Brazilian Embraer and the Canadian bombing for customers.The Chinese Comac is still far behind.But their requirements are promising:
Behind the company are the state and with it corresponding financial resources in order to reconnect with the large western aircraft manufacturers.China was also the country, which the Boeing 737 Max pulled out of circulation very quickly.Was this also an industrial policy decision?
"I don't think so," says Thomas Jaeger from the Aviation News Portal "CH-Aviation".«The Comac aircraft are still far from western pilots as far as quality is concerned.»Such a decision would come much too early to help Comac.
"The decision of the authority has made Chinese airlines in state -owned," says Jaeger.The Comac C919 is in direct competition with the Airbus 320-neo-family and the Boeing 737 max.So far, the Chinese have received over 800 orders for the jet, most of them from the domestic market.
The C919 is scheduled to start the line service from 2021.Do Airbus and Boeing have to fear the competition from China?"Only when the large Chinese airlines can reliably use the C919 for a long time is that possible," says Thomas Jaeger.
Until then, international airlines will be careful not to sit on the Chinese aircraft.Now you also have to stay on the ground in the United States: Boeing 737 Max 8, here in Miami.
Photo: Getty Images -Erste airline calls for compensation for the crash of two brand new machines of type 737 max 8 within five months could develop into a financial disaster for the manufacturer Boeing.Yesterday, a first airline, the low -cost airline Norwegian, announced claims for compensation.
Boeing will "send the bill," said a spokesman.Norwegian should not suffer financially because a completely new plane cannot fly.The financially battered airline has 18 machines of type 737
Max 8. You had to delete 19 flights yesterday and rebook the passengers.Boeing does not use a number of other airlines for the time being, including Tuifly, Icelandair, Turkish Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas.
Aeroméxico, Cayman Airways, the Polish Lot and the Brazilian Gol Airlines.When looking for the causes of the crash on Sunday, Ethiopian Airlines gave the first clues yesterday.The pilot reported problems with the flight control, but no external factors such as bird strike, said a spokesman.

Who has that in the cockpit?/ / Flight safety after two crashes of new Boeing 737
Max arises as to whether automated systems have too much power on the plane.The pilot basically has the decision -making power - but sometimes time is missing in emergency situations.Alexandra Bröhmwer actually says in the cockpit: man or machine?
, many passengers have been wondering since this week.After a Boeing 737 Max 8 of the Indonesian Lion Air had fallen shortly after the start of the sea in October, a few days ago, an identical machine also smashed shortly after lifting in Ethiopia.Little is still known about the second cause of the accident, but new software played a crucial role in the crash in October.
Because it is possible that the second crash has similar causes, the Boeing 737 Max must currently remain on the ground in many countries.There have been discussions about automated help in the cockpit for a long time.The computers have taken on numerous tasks in the aircraft even more than in the cars.
"Almost every subsystem has its own computer today," says Christoph Regli.He heads the Aviatics course at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and is himself a line pilot and computer science engineer ETH.There are assistance systems that support the pilot in his work and there is the autopilot who completely takes over the control.
In most cases, the pilots fly starts and landings, supported by digital assistants.The autopilot only takes over from a certain flight altitude.Experience
The pilots also decide almost always have the option of switching off the automated systems.In an emergency, however, there are two challenges.If there is a critical situation near the ground, i.e. during the start or landing, every second counts.
"No pilot then has the time to go through long checklists," says Regli.These checklists specify the action steps in an emergency, which one would have to do after the systems are switched off.In addition, the pilot must first notice which systems cause problems and should be switched off, which can be difficult under time pressure.
But time pressure is not only demanding.The pilots regularly practice every emergency scenario in the simulator, but a real emergency can feel very different.A large line jet without controlling automated help systems is not an everyday maneuver for a pilot, even if they are practiced. "A very important factor is experience," says Regli.
A good example is the successful emergency watering of Chesley B. Sullenberger, called Sully, in 2009 on the Hudson River in New York.Sully had over 20,000 flight hours when he made the maneuver after the failure of both engines.Various media reported after the crash on Sunday that the captain of the Ethiopian flight was still young at the age of 29, but had already completed 8,000 flight hours.
However, his co-pilot only brought it to 200 hours.In the United States, a co-pilot must be able to show 1,500 flight hours before it can control line jets at all.It is 200 hours in Switzerland.
It is also crucial in an emergency situation that captain and co-pilot work well together as a team.The autopilot was originally intended to relieve the pilots of routine tasks, for example to help them keep the correct height and speed constant."It is an almost philosophical question whether the machine supports or patronized people," says Regli.
In the 1980s, the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus introduced the so-called Flight Envelope Protection system.It was supposed to protect the pilot from abrupt dangerous flight maneuvers, so there were certain parameters within which the plane should move.For example, if a pilot wants to fly too risky maneuver, in which a flow of flow could threaten, the computer turns on correctly.
If you are worried because your own computer likes to bitch around, you should know that the aircraft software has to go through a much stricter test for possible mistakes than commercial solutions on your home PC.However, the automated systems are dependent on data from all possible sensors in order to be able to react to situations.Defective
Sensorist sensors are usually available in multiple execution, based on the principle of redundancy, which plays a central role in flight safety.If a system fails, there is a backup.However, each software can only work correctly if the sensors provide correct data.
"The dependence on correctly working sensors is a fundamental problem of automation," says Professor Michel Guillaume, who heads the Center for Aviatics on Zhaw and also teaches at ETH Zurich.One that will be even more acute in unmanned driving or airplanes.A defective sensor also played a role in the crash of the Indonesian Lion Air.
The sensor that measures the angle of attack, i.e. the angle between the wing and air flow, sent false data to the on -board computer.Therefore, a software newly developed by Boeing, which is intended to prevent flow tears.This new software, which Boeing introduced with the 737 Max, is the focus of the investigators for the crash in October.
The aircraft manufacturers have developed the Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).This has shifted the focus of the machine and the risk of a flow of flow increases.There can be a flow of flow if the aircraft's nose goes too far up.
The plane then falls from the sky like a stone.Such is particularly dangerous near the ground.If it happens at great height, the pilots can intercept the machine.
To do this, you have to work against intuition, which is only possible under time pressure if you have practiced it countless times.When the aircraft is in free fall, the pilots have to push the nose down so that the air flows up the wings and the aerodynamics let the aircraft fly again. «Pilot was noticing a mistot» The Lion Air pilot did not notice that itfought against the MCAS.He pulled his nose up over twenty times, and the software, which incorrectly suspected a flow of flow, pushed it down again.
"The pilot made a mistake," says US air drive expert Peter Lemme, who previously worked as an engineer at Boeing.However, there was also criticism of Boeing because the company had not pointed out the pilots or too little to the MCAS.Now Boeing has to revise the system by April on the instructions of the American supervisory authorities.
You still don't know enough about the crash of Sunday.But there are certain parallels between the two disasters.The pilot of the Ethiopian aircraft also fought to let the machine rise.
In an interview with CNN, the Airline CEO said that the pilot also reported the tower problems with flight control when he asked to return before the crash.The “New York Times” reported two other cases in the United States, in which pilots reported problems with the MCAS in late autumn because it pressed the nose down.However, they were able to solve these problems by switching off the corresponding systems.
In the meantime, all line pilots should actually know about the MCAS.The experts do not agree on how risky it is currently to get as a passenger in a 737 max.Christoph Regli would continue to fly, Michel Guillaume would not be before there are clearer answers.
However, he points out that the plane is still the safest means of transport statistically."Almost every second an airplane starts, compared to very few accidents in comparison." If it threatens to become risky, the computer intervenes.
The principle of redundancy plays an important role in security.How the new control system of the Boeing 737 Max works1 The sensor for the angle of attack depends on the air flow and sends data to the on -board computer.2 If the angle is large, the MANUVERING Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) .3

Letters to the NZZ / / The Army is better than setting their call -open companies when recruiting their growth of cadres on other talents and qualities than on military leadership experience (NZZ 5. 3. 19).The share prices in the financial sector are already proving that top managers and headhunter are wrong.
When the executive floors of the banks were still equipped with managers with great military leadership experience, the share prices were significantly higher than today.The quality of the decisions was also much better before globalization than after.A manager with a military training first asks how he can serve the matter.
The question of revenue comes later.This gives you a completely different culture in the company.Managers with military leadership experience are used to making a thorough position assessment.
You know the means of your company and the competition.They also assess the environment.You are also used to performing top performance via a longer period:
They motivate their employees and set clear goals.They have learned to delegate and lead appreciative.Christian Haltner, Stäfafür part of the 68s and Post-68 generation, is everything that has a hint of the army is suspect.
Young people, on the other hand, perceive the world situation with the multipolar threat much better than the 57 Plus generation.The majority of you have no effort with the meaning of the army.But probably with the badly talked image.
The old "squad loops" with the male barrack tone have been practiced since the fall of the wall.With the army forms, content and didactics were continuously adapted.The status of the squad training in our army is good to very good.
I was on NATO college several times.The Swiss professional and militia officers have a very good reputation there.Unfortunately, the officer career in Switzerland is traded too much today.
No question: Army, economy and society are required.The army is not a nice club.It has a clear constitutional mandate for the Swiss Security Architecture.
This requires first -class talents.The officer training must offer compatible added value for economy and administration.Colonel Gerhard Läuchli, Baselal's reader with his own leadership experience from our army, I know that what is still offered in the leadership is still extremely useful and valuable.
This will also stay that way because the principles of leadership, whether in the military, in companies or anywhere else, are ultimately logical and simple and always the same, "no rocket science".But you have to know and practice them and internalize them as far as possible.A lack of leadership experience can still be nerves;
That will also stay that way.Interesting that the value of military leadership experience is recognized in countries in which it is not (such as in Switzerland) because of the militia system very natural and still transferred to civilian and to the companies.In the United States, large companies are targeting former military.
As for the higher management level: When visiting the Ecole Militaire in Paris last year, we learned that French companies send selected top cadres for expensive money to Ecole Militaire for months, where they can catch up with what our army "free" offers us.For the lack of demand, the suspicion is that management experience is less in demand for activities that have little to decide and conduct - and there are more and more of these activities in the course of the bureaucratization of the companies.Keywords are algorithms, audit, compliance or robotization.
Hans Bollmann, Zurichvage allegations and ethical principles are shocked by the article "to death beaten because of a rhino - the WWF has a problem» (NZZ 7. 19).Was it clarified who is behind the current hunt and why the WWF is defamed?The allegations are vague;
Taking it unseen is damaging to the reputation.The endangered animal species need protection, primarily the acute threatened with extinction, which are particularly lucrative for poachers.Perhaps the media will inquire once about the risk of wildkeepers and their families if they face the shops of the poachers and their backers, resisting the temptation to enrich themselves illegally.
The media should ensure balance and the extremely vague but massive accusations should not simply leave.Otherwise, their unreflected distribution in no time is damaged in a proven organization and their decades of commitment.Jacqueline Staub, Riehenden article about the WWF and the national parks focus on human rights violations;
Brutal approach to indigenous peoples is reported.However, this only addresses a dimension of the challenges of the WWF.Actually, the autochthonous population would have to be met with as much respect and competence as the fauna.
The WWF is overwhelmed.Biodiversity and the environment are of low priority in poor countries, especially in poor countries with a weak governance, if tourism does not bring important foreign exchange, as in the case of the Chitwan Park in Nepal.The international community must not believe that in an environment without a functioning administration, where it goes without saying that the country's resources are illegally and by means of corruption abroad, the national parks are managed according to international ethical principles.
Andreas Schild, ThunpostFinance as a lender these days, the modest conclusion of the post office has been presented (NZZ 8. 3. 19).Various voices criticize again that PostFinance should be allowed to award mortgage loans, as the banks and insurance companies do so that the money parked with PostFinance could be spent profitably.It is forgotten that the solid lending requires a well -trained employee who has many years of experience in the credit and can assess properties due to its location, structural quality, etc.
Where does Postfinance get these employees from?Werning from banks and insurance?Train yourself?
And where should they work?Probably not in the places where the objects to be financed are located, but far from four to five centers - without reference to reality.It is warned of bonus -controlled managers who are trying to bring mortgages to the people in the currently flourishing housing market - the state bears possible losses.
The following applies to PostFinance: cobbler, stay with your strips!Richard Rahm, Seuzachveloverleihder Zürcher City Council tries to prefer his own solution to PubliBike by loading the competition with additional fees (NZZ 8. 3. 19).This is unfair competition.
The Velos of Publibike are cumbersome, worse and impractical and tied to a few, not well -located locations.Smide is a practical and perfect solution.In addition, Smide has already paid taxes for using the public ground with redeeming the vehicle numbers.
If Smide has to withdraw, I will have to use my car or the Vespa again, but certainly not public.The city council should become reasonable.Andreas J. Schlegel, Küsnacht

Aviation authorities in the dilemma / / Andreas Spaethdie only chance to find out facts about the cause of the crash of the Boeing 737 Max 8 of Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday is the evaluation of the flight data recorder and the voice recorder from the cockpit.
Both were recovered at the crash site on Monday.However, the airline announced on Wednesday that it had not even been decided to put the land in which the devices should be brought so that the evaluation could be made.In a statement, a spokesman emphasized that the flight writers were to be examined in Europe if possible.
However, the question arises whether the data carriers are sufficiently preserved in order to be able to deliver facts.In any case, there is fear that there will still be a lot of time until secure information about the cause of the crash.At the moment there is not even final knowledge about the cause of the accident of the identical aircraft type of Indonesian Lion Air from October 2018.
This is not unusual either, because such investigations take time.In any case, the United States moved to the US Air Force Authority FAA on Tuesday evening no reason for a starting ban for the Boeing 737 max.
The United States was increasingly isolated.But the turn came on Wednesday: after the EU countries, Switzerland and numerous other countries, the USA also banned a start.
All of the 737 Max machines should remain on the ground with immediate effect, said American President Donald Trump in Washington.Boeing itself also recommended a temporary starting ban for all almost 400 aircraft of the 737-Max series worldwide.It was a pure precaution, the manufacturer said.
"Boeing continues to have full confidence in the security of the 737 max." A novelty in the history of such grounding of an aircraft type due to subjective feelings of uncertainty of aircraft operators and passengers has never existed in the history of traffic flying.But the fact is that the grounding of the 737 Max does not hit the aviation industry particularly hard at the moment.There are overcapacities worldwide, and most airlines also operate other types of the previous 737 generation with which the MAX can be temporarily replaced.

Trump leaves aircraft on the floor / / by Philipp Felberwashington.After a long hesitation, the United States made a flight ban on Boeing machines of Type 737 last night and imposed a flight ban on Boeing
Max 8 and Max 9. US President Donald Trump gave a corresponding instruction to all airlines after two types of aircraft have crashed within five months and a total of 346 people were killed.Trump said the US Air Faa would arrange the starting ban.The order applies now.
According to the US media, a phone call between Trump and Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg had previously taken place.As Dienew York Times reported, Muilenburg near Trump promoted not to abolish the approval for the aircraft - apparently in vain.Previously, the European flight authority, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Oman, Australia, South Korea and Mongolia imposed a flight ban for the 737 Max.
But the US flight authority Faa hesitated to block the aircraft type.With her decision she was almost alone.The fact that she did not act on her own is that she had classified the plane as safe and approved.
Now admitting that you lay wrong would have been a bitter blow for the authority.However, an industrial policy move to protect Boeing was not to be assumed.The Boeing 787 Grounding Grounding through the FAA around six years ago shows that the US authority does not deal with the aircraft manufacturer at home.
In addition, the FAA is strictly concerned with approvals.China is still far from it that Boeing, as the largest export company, is very important for the US economy.A corresponding major effects should have a decision against the aircraft.
The Boeing 737 Max was to secure the supremacy in aviation for the next few years.Boeing and the European competitor Airbus primarily divide the business with civil aircraft.Behind it are manufacturers such as the Brazilian Embraer and the Canadian bombing for customers.
The Chinese Comac is still far behind.However, their prerequisites are promising: behind the company the state and the corresponding financial resources are in order to reclass the big western aircraft manufacturers one day.
China was the country that the Boeing 737 Max pulled out of circulation very quickly.Was this also an industrial policy decision?"I don't think so," says Thomas Jaeger from aviation news portalch-aviation.
«The Comac aircraft are still far from western pilots as far as quality is concerned.»Such a decision would come much too early to help Comac."The decision of the authority has made Chinese airlines in state -owned," says Jaeger.800 orders
Incidental Comac C919 is in direct competition with the Airbus 320-neo-family and the Boeing 737 max.So far, the Chinese have received over 800 orders for the jet, most of them from the domestic market.The C919 will be used on short and medium distance and should start the line service from 2021.
Do Airbus and Boeing have to fear the competition from China? ”Only when the large Chinese airlines can reliably use the C919 for a long time is that possible,» says Jaeger.Until then, international airlines will be careful not to sit on the Chinese aircraft.
Page 35 most airline demands compensation.
The crash of two brand new machines of type 737 max 8 within five months could develop into a financial disaster for the manufacturer Boeing.Yesterday, a first airline, the low -cost airline Norwegian, announced claims for compensation.Boeing will "send the bill," said a spokesman.
Norwegian should not suffer financially because a completely new plane cannot fly.The financially battered airline has 18 machines of the 737 max 8.
Yesterday she had to delete 19 flights and rebook the passengers.Boeing does not use a number of other airlines for the time being, including Tuifly, Icelandair, Turkish Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas.Aeroméxico, Cayman Airways, the Polish Lot and the Brazilian Gol Airlines.
When looking for the causes of the crash on Sunday, Ethiopian Airlines gave the first clues yesterday.The pilot reported problems with the flight control, but no external factors such as bird strike, said a spokesman.According to the flight observation platform flight trading, the machine dropped off after around 1000 foot climbing and immediately went up again before it disappeared from the radar.

Learning to fly, but correct / / The prison authorities are a panicked fear of misconception.This is bad .
Because errors are useful, even when dealing with dangerous criminals - provided you pull the right lessons out of it in good time.Fear is always a bad guide.From Alex Bauram March 15, 2011 shortly before lunchtime, there was almost a disaster at Zurich Airport:
A air traffic controller with a total of 260 people on board had a starting permit on board on two slopes that crossed.One of the pilots recognized the danger and slowed down the already rolling machine.Two seconds later, the air traffic controller also recognized its capital error and ordered start termination.
In November 2018, more than seven years after the nearest, the Skyguide air traffic controller had been responsible for “disruption to public transport” before the Higher Court of the Canton of Zurich.In 2016, the Bülach district court acquitted him of guilt and punishment, but the public prosecutor continued the judgment.She asked for a conditional punishment.
Crash of the error culture in real life of the crash failed to collide in the virtual world of the judiciary two cultures that could hardly be more different.On the one hand, it is due to the period of more than seven years to clarify a simple and undisputed error.They may accept lawyers with a fatalistic shrug.
Such a sloppiness would be unthinkable in aviation.The primary goal is to quickly identify mistakes and to draw the teachings out of it to avoid repeating.On the other hand, sanctions in aviatics are at most intended for really gross negligent or even willful misconduct.
In this case there was no such.Actually there is only one mortal sin: covering up an error.If an error is reported correctly, which the Zurich air traffic controller did, this has at most administrative consequences.
In the specific case, this meant that Skyguide pulled the man back from duty on the front and put him in a team that is supposed to uncover and eradicate security gaps.Yes you've read correctly .
And the decision is right too.The experience of a fast disaster may have sharpened the sensitivity of the pilot for dangers.The culture of errors in aviation is not god, it was developed in a hundred years of hard experience and after some catastrophes from practice.
It was always about life and death.Only the result is essential.And that can be seen.
If the aircraft was the most dangerous of all means of transport in its beginnings, it is by far the safest.If 90 percent of flight accidents were once due to mechanical and only ten percent of human failure, it is the other way around.This is a unique success story.
And every pilot learns from the first day: security is not a condition, but a process in which work is permanently worked and that must be questioned continuously.Routine is not just an advantage, it can be an insidious enemy.The prison and flying have a lot in common.
In both industries, risk management is of central importance, the greatest uncertainty factor is hidden in the human soul.Dealing with violent crimes can be compared to a flight in the event of uncertain weather.Before a pilot climbs into his plane, he will consult all possible reports.
But forecasts are never more than a probability calculation.Any misjudgment can be fatal, especially for third parties.Instead of judging by a air traffic controller, which a - undoubtedly SauN number - mistakes have made, the judiciary should therefore better ask whether it should not learn from the error culture of the aviatic.
It could prevent a lot of suffering.Similar to an expert who must be on the release of a perhaps dangerous criminal, the pilot decides under great pressure.When flying, it is to comply with a timetable that needs to be weighed up against the safety of passengers.
In prison, it is public security, which is in a tension between the freedom rights of a hopefully re -socialized and purified delinquent.A misjudgment can lead to catastrophe.The grossly negligent handling of dangerous violence, as was common in Switzerland until the mid -1990s, is history, at least in Zurich.
The murder in Zollikerberg from 1993 brought a turning point.New laws have been created, the practice was stricely tightened.Highly specialized forensics such as Frank Urbaniok have developed instruments and checklists with which the risk of relapse is to be systematically recorded and shown.
Relapses have never been completely excluded, but the canton of Zurich has been spared the great disaster since then.As a reporter, I have followed some cases of falling pleasure murderers - namely Daniel Hofmann in Aargau (2009), Claude Dubois in Vaud (spring 2013) or Fabrice Anthamatten in Geneva (autumn 2013) - closely pursued with their own, elaborate research.In all cases, warning signals were overlooked, and human failure played a central role, especially among the experts.
Where the checklists were used, the alarm signs were seen.In the language of court psychiatry, one would probably say: Although the danger of the relapse offenders, the danger of the relapse was recognized, but the enforcement authorities were unable to act according to this insight.
Dubois and Anthamatten, I dare to say, would not have come released so quickly in Zurich.In my view, the danger lurks somewhere else today.And she is no less perfidious in her own way.
The hard line and the fear of fatal mistakes can lead to striking offenders longer than deserving or necessary, in the worst case for the rest of their lives - only because nobody dares to issue them to them for dismissal.But just as a guilt is much easier than the innocence, it is difficult for a prisoner to demonstrate its harmless behind bars.Overcrowded prisons do not necessarily make life safer, as the experiences from North and South America show.
A judiciary that locks people away without need makes themselves a criminal.And not only that: if you cannot identify the supposedly dangerous, in truth, but in truth, but harmless perpetrators, then you don't really know about the effectively dangerous.Adaptable psychopathy is more difficult than looking into a person's soul.
A study from Canada led to a fatal knowledge: the higher the psychopathy indicator, the greater the statistical opportunities of a sex offender on early discharge.This is not really surprising, since psychopaths are considered adaptable.
The gift of manipulating and deceiving others distinguishes them.The words of the Forensician Volker Dittmann on the occasion of the Hofmann trial sound in my ears: «Unfortunately, I cannot make a reasonable diagnosis;Because of his many years of and intensive experience with the therapists and lawyers, the Explorand knows exactly what the experts and judges want to hear from him;
There is no relying on his information. »After all, forensic psychiatry has made progress in recent years, as well as neurology and gene research.I think Frank Urbaniok is on the right track.
The goal must be to develop practical, sharply defined and verifiable criteria based on concrete experiences.Such crime and perpetrators are never perfect and always affected with mistakes.But it is crucial that we recognize these mistakes and draw the teachings from it.
With every mistake we correct, the system of perfection comes a step closer.The forensic-psychiatric experts and prison authorities have a tremendous need to catch up with regard to an error culture, which deserves this name.The fear of making mistakes is too big.
This inevitably leads to ignoring mistakes to try out or cover up.It is a human reaction.But fear has never been a good guide.
Defend yourself, explain to yourself!You can only advise the forensics: don't let us put you off journalists, all the politicians, anger and know -it -alls who demand retaliation for every mistake, immediately measures and preferably a few heads on top of that.
Defend yourself, explain to you, go on the offensive - stands by your mistakes.Make it like the pilots!Errors can make any mistakes at any time, they are not a shame - that was the first thing my flight instructor is in.
The big challenge is to recognize and accept these mistakes, especially if they are embarrassed to us.Because only those who are constantly aware of their susceptibility to errors have a chance to avoid the big mistakes.We always have to be aware that absolute security is a goal that we can never achieve.
This has nothing to do with resignation, but on the contrary, with the will to do our best.Flying is a complex process in which you can do a thousand things wrong.The pilot makes some mistake on almost every flight.
The safety margins and procedures are designed so that they usually forgive a single error.In the case of Zurich's air traffic controller, the pilot involved was also responsible for not blinding instructions from the tower.It is almost always a chain of mistakes that leads to the catastrophe.
The aim is therefore to minimize these sources of error.After each flight, weaknesses are discussed in a debriefing.Errors are not considered a flaw, especially not if you open them yourself.
The error culture was born out of necessity.With flying, people went into a dimension a hundred years ago that had previously been strange to him.It was a dangerous but also tempting adventure with gigantic potential.
Every breakdown and every mistake made flying better and safer.To date, not only every accident, but also every dangerous situation, has to be reported, preferably by voluntary disclosure.Sanctions are only intended for covered -up breakdowns.
Accident reports are open to the public, complete and uncensored.Practically every rule and every procedure in aviation is based on an accident report.On August 15, 1949, for example, a Douglas C-54, which had assumed the fuel when I was approaching Shannon, was able to do not water off the Irish coast.
Fifty passengers saved themselves, drowned nine.Since then, life jackets have to be carried on all flights over water.Three years later, a DC-4 of the Pan
Wood clean on the front of Puerto Rico;Nevertheless, most passengers went under with the machine because the machine had occurred to chaos.Since then, the crew of an aircraft with the well -known sentences has been instructing the passengers before every start via emergency exits and dealing with life jackets.
With each flight, the passengers are given the possibility of a fatal catastrophe.Anyone who experiences the announcements for the first time may react concerned.Most quickly get used to it.
As paradoxical as it may sound: the open examination of the risk tames fear.Because it always shows you how low this risk is - and that you do the human possible possible to further lower it.
If there is a disaster, nobody demands the end of flying, heads are rarely challenged.Remarkably pragmatic Swiss, everyone is free to avoid aircraft if they do not plunge on their heads (that also happens).We cannot miss dangerous criminals.
Unlike the pilot, who also jeopardizes his own life with every risk, it rarely hits the enforcement officer or experts in the event of a catastrophe.Nevertheless, the goal of re -socialization is largely undisputed in our society.The fact that even a murderer is usually released after fifteen years at the latest and that a teenager is almost never really punished, hardly ever leads to protests.
The Swiss have a remarkably pragmatic attitude towards criminals.In the case of dangerous relapse, however, compassion quickly drops below freezing.And rightly so .
The distrust of the criminal justice and the enforcement authorities is not only based on the sins of the past.It also has to do with an increasing estrangement between the people and the judiciary, which I have observed as a court reporter in the past few decades and - unfortunately quite unsuccessfully - criticized again and again.It is a creeping development, but the direction of march is clear:
Away from the open process towards cabinet justice.Where the lawyers once argued in front of jurors in public and struggle for justice, academics in the quiet closet are now bound over filing mountains.With the new Code of Criminal Procedure, the public hearing, if it still takes place at all, is fully atrophied for alibi exercise.
You can no longer get a picture without knowledge of the file.Despite the increasingly lengthy and bureaucratic procedures, the judgments did not get any better.Meanwhile, data and personal protection has reached surreal spheres.
In Switzerland, murder processes are carried out today, in which the private plaintiff is withheld from all preliminary acts and psychiatric reports.In the name of the victim protection, the public is excluded from procedures, even if victims or their relatives do not want this at all.Enforcement files are treated even more like a state secret, in doubt it is censored and anonymized.
The secret crowl has its price, it hits the trust.If you hide something, everyone learns from an early age, you usually have something to hide.At best, it is comfortable for the authorities if you do not have to explain yourself in a difficult case.
The official secret can also be misused as a cheap pretext in order to cover up wrong sheath and to return uncomfortable facts under the carpet.It is also not necessarily in the interest of criminals if they steal into anonymous letters and soulless files.A nonsense about the “file K.” is easy for a journalist;
But if he calls Kessler by name for the specific person, he will be more careful.Anonymization is also a form of stigmatization.Just as you hidden daughters from the curious eyes of the neighborhood, criminals are banished from public life.
An enlightened society may be expected to handle the crime open and sensibly.And if you no longer trust her, you shouldn't be surprised if the understanding is lost.The practice -oriented culture of errors has weaknesses.
This can also be illustrated using the example of flying.Thousands of accident reports, which are submitted to the air offices worldwide, result in a flood of new rules and recommendations that are not always sensible.Co -regulation can unexpectedly lead to new risks.
According to 9/11, the cockpits of passenger pilots, for example, were retrofitted with tank doors, which can be locked from the inside.When the Germanwings flight crashed 9525 in the French Alps in March 2015, this security proved to be fatal.The mechanism allowed life-tired co-pilots Andreas Lubitz to lock himself up in the cockpit.
So the crew, which had recognized the danger, could not prevent Lubitz from steering the aircraft into the rock face.Some airlines had that a pilot must never sit alone in the cockpit.But that brings new dangers with it.
If a pilot is no longer allowed to go to the toilet, even though it should urgently have to impair its ability to concentrate enormously.The likelihood that a pilot plagued by urge to urinate or other hardships will make a fatal mistake is allegedly greater than the risk that a mass murderer like Lubitz will get to the tax horn of an airliner.Trust and backing the danger that exaggerated caution and the bottom line of security is undoubtedly also in prison.
As a rule of thumb, the more complicated a procedure is, the more susceptible it is for errors.Control is good, but more control does not automatically mean better control.
Too many cooks spoil the broth .The more actors are included in a decision, the less responsibility is transferred to the individual until nobody feels responsible.In my opinion, the key is: clearly regulated responsibilities.
In the end, a system never decides, but always man.And very important: Those who make difficult decisions not only need the necessary skills, but also trust and backing.Because it is not enough to recognize the danger, often there is a lack of the ability to act according to this insight.

Who has that in the cockpit?/ / By Alexandra Bröhmwer actually says in the cockpit: man or machine?, many passengers have been wondering since this week.
After a Boeing 737 Max 8 of the Indonesian Lion Air had fallen shortly after the start of the sea in October, a few days ago, an identical machine also smashed shortly after lifting in Ethiopia.Little is still known about the second cause of the accident, but new software played a crucial role in the crash in October.Because it is possible that the second crash has similar causes, the Boeing 737 Max must currently remain on the ground in many countries.
There have been discussions about automated help in the cockpit for a long time.The computers have taken on numerous tasks in the aircraft even more than in the cars."Almost every subsystem has its own computer today," says Christoph Regli.
He heads the Aviatics course at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and is himself a line pilot and computer science engineer ETH.There are assistance systems that support the pilot in his work and there is the autopilot who completely takes over the control.In most cases, the pilots fly starts and landings, supported by digital assistants.
The autopilot only takes over from a certain flight altitude.Experience decision -making pilots also almost always have the opportunity to switch off the automated systems.
In an emergency, however, there are two challenges.If there is a critical situation near the ground, i.e. during the start or landing, every second counts."No pilot then has the time to go through long checklists," says Regli.
These checklists specify the action steps in an emergency, which one would have to do after the systems are switched off.In addition, the pilot must first notice which systems cause problems and should be switched off, which can be difficult under time pressure.But time pressure is not only demanding.
The pilots regularly practice every emergency scenario in the simulator, but a real emergency can feel very different.A large line jet without controlling automated help systems is not an everyday maneuver for a pilot, even if they are practiced. "A very important factor is experience," says Regli.A good example is the successful emergency watering of Chesley B. Sullenberger, called Sully, in 2009 on the Hudson River in New York.
Sully had over 20,000 flight hours when he made the maneuver after the failure of both engines.Various media reported after the crash on Sunday that the captain of the Ethiopian flight was still young at the age of 29, but had already completed 8,000 flight hours.However, his co-pilot only brought it to 200 hours.
In the United States, a co-pilot must be able to show 1,500 flight hours before it can control line jets at all.It is 200 hours in Switzerland.It is also crucial in an emergency situation that captain and co-pilot work well together as a team.
The autopilot was originally intended to relieve the pilots of routine tasks, for example to help them keep the correct height and speed constant."It is an almost philosophical question whether the machine supports or patronized people," says Regli.In the 1980s, the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus introduced the so-called Flight Envelope Protection system.
It was supposed to protect the pilot from abrupt dangerous flight maneuvers, so there were certain parameters within which the plane should move.For example, if a pilot wants to fly too risky maneuver, in which a flow of flow could threaten, the computer turns on correctly.If you are worried because your own computer likes to bitch around, you should know that the aircraft software has to go through a much stricter test for possible mistakes than commercial solutions on your home PC.
However, the automated systems are dependent on data from all possible sensors in order to be able to react to situations.Defective sensor sensors are usually available in multiple execution, based on the principle of redundancy, which plays a central role in flight safety.
If a system fails, there is a back-up.However, each software can only work correctly if the sensors provide correct data."The dependence on correctly working sensors is a fundamental problem of automation," says Professor Michel Guillaume, who heads the Center for Aviatics on Zhaw and also teaches at ETH Zurich.
A problem that will be even more acute in unmanned driving or airplanes.A defective sensor also played a role in the crash of the Indonesian Lion Air.The sensor that measures the angle of attack, i.e. the angle between the wing and air flow, sent false data to the on -board computer.
Therefore, a software newly developed by Boeing, which is intended to prevent flow tears.This new software, which Boeing introduced with the 737 Max, is the focus of the investigators for the crash in October.The aircraft manufacturers have developed the Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
This has shifted the focus of the machine and the risk of a flow of flow increases.There can be a flow of flow if the aircraft's nose goes too far up.The plane then falls from the sky like a stone.
Such is particularly dangerous near the ground.If it happens at great height, the pilots can intercept the machine.To do this, you have to work against intuition, which is only possible under time pressure if you have practiced it countless times.
When the aircraft is in free fall, the pilots have to push the nose down so that the air flows up the wings and the aerodynamics let the aircraft fly again. «Pilot was noticing a mistot» The Lion Air pilot did not notice that itfought against the MCAS.He pulled his nose up over 20 times, and the software, which incorrectly suspected a flow of flow, pushed it down again."The pilot made a mistake," says US air drive expert Peter Lemme, who previously worked as an engineer at Boeing.
However, there was also criticism of Boeing because the company had not pointed out the pilots or too little to the MCAS.Now Boeing has to revise the system at the instructions of the American supervisory authorities until April.You still don't know enough about the crash of Sunday.
But there are certain parallels between the two disasters.The pilot of the Ethiopian aircraft also fought to let the machine rise.In an interview, the CEO of the airline also complained that the pilot also reported the tower problems with flight control when he asked to return before the crash.
Dienew York Times reported from two other cases in the United States, in which pilots reported problems with the MCAS in late autumn because it pressed the nose down.However, they were able to solve these problems by switching off the corresponding systems.In the meantime, all line pilots should actually know about the MCAS.
The experts do not agree on how risky it is currently to get as a passenger in a 737 max.Christoph Regli would continue to fly, Michel Guillaume would not be before there are clearer answers.However, he points out that the plane is still the safest means of transport statistically.

Trump prohibited the use of the accident aircraft / / Philipp Felbernach long hesitation made the USA last night and imposed a flight ban on Boeing machines of type 737
Max 8 and Max 9. US President Donald Trump gave a corresponding instruction to all airlines after two types of aircraft have crashed within five months and a total of 346 people were killed.Trump said the US Air Faa would arrange the starting ban.The order applies now.
According to the US media, a phone call between Trump and Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg had previously taken place.As the “New York Times” reported, Muilenburg near Trump advertised not to remove the approval for the aircraft - apparently in vain.Shortly after Trumps
Order also reacted by the group and recommended that all types of type - 371 aircraft worldwide - should remain on the ground.Previously, the European flight authority, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Oman, Australia, South Korea and Canada imposed a flight ban for the 737 Max.But the US flight authority Faa hesitated to block the aircraft type.

How it will continue after the Boeing machines crashed / / Aviation The Type 737 Max aircraft are no longer allowed to take off.
An overview of the most important questions about the case.All flights of the Boeing series 737 Max have now been banned worldwide.Finally, the American aviation authority Federal Aviation Administration also decided after two accidents in a row that the machines have to stay on the ground.
Some airlines have already checked claims for damages.Boeing is developing new software and the French flight accident authority Bea begins with the evaluation of the flight writer.What has to happen so that the 737 Max can fly again?
The aircraft could stay on the ground for weeks, if not months.Two factors are likely to be decisive: Boeing develops an update for the so -called Manufacturing Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
If the autopilot is not switched on, the system intervenes in certain flight areas.After the update, it should warn the pilots when MCAS is active - so that they always know what the computer is doing.In addition, MCAS should no longer be able to move the aircraft's control surfaces up to the stop.
As a result, the pilots can still hold it manually in the future, even if they forget to switch off the system.But the first flight tests have just taken place, and the new software needs to be released by the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Even if this is granted, it is not certain whether the rest of the world will follow:
Other countries first acted in the flight bans, the skepticism is great.It could look very different if it turns out that the ethiopian airlines crash from last Sunday is not related to the system.This will show the evaluation of the flight writers.
How are these flight data examined?The Ethiopian authorities are actually responsible for analyzing the accident.However, you have decided to delegate the evaluation of the flight data writer and the voice recorder to the French Bureau d ’enquêtes et d’ Analyses pour la securité de l ’aviation civile (BEA).
According to the rules of the international civil aviation organization ICAO, a first interim report on the accident should be available after one month.How important is the MCAS software for safe flying?The Lion-Air crash in Indonesia in October 2018 was triggered by a defective sensor that provided incorrect data.
The MCAS system itself worked correctly.It is just an additional function that is not used at all with a normal flight.In the future, Boeing will have to ensure that the data with which the control is supplied is always correct.
If there are doubts about your correctness, the system must not start.This is also the case with other systems, at Airbus all critical computers are fed by at least two sensors.When the data is different, the computer raises alarm.
The tragedy in the case of the crashed Lion-Air machine is that the pilots could have easily switched off MCAS with a switch on the center console.You just didn't do it.Therefore, the following also applies: devices and computers will always fail or become active due to incorrect data.
It is crucial that the pilots are well trained to deal with it.Why has the United States' aviation authority waited for so long with its flight ban?FAA boss Dan Elwell has explained his attitude in detail on the American broadcaster NBC.
You could not make such a far -reaching decision as that of pulling a whole fleet of a type out of circulation, not because of some "gut feeling", but you have to do this based on data.It can be argued that the other countries and the European Union, which had previously pronounced flight bans, did not do so on the basis of data, but due to public pressure.Because when they imposed the bans, there was no evidence of substance that there could be a connection with MCAS in ethiopian crash;
This context has now been proven in the Lion-Air-Undlück.Then, however, analyzed the FAA and the Canadian aviation authority satellite data and found similarities in the profile of the two flights- i.e. at altitude and speed changes.Even some debris that have now been recovered could not refute the McAS theory.
What are the consequences of the flight ban for passengers?Passengers have to prepare for them to be rebooked to other connections.The airlines will rely on the fact that the flight ban is a case of force majeure and do not pay any compensation.

New airport in Lisbon - an air castle?/ / Thomas Fischer, Lisbonsie were far ahead of their time.
Two Iberia pilots did not land their DC-9 in July 1985 at the Airport of the Portuguese capital, but on the Air Force Base of Montijo on the other, southern banks of the Tejo River.A confusion.What caused ironic comments and headlines at the time should be common from 2022.
Because Lisbon's airport bursts at the seams for tourists, the civilian use of the Montijo base is planned, especially for low-cost flights.According to the business professor and former finance minister Luis Campos e Cunha, Montijo is the most beautiful airport in the world.He would lie directly on the Tejo and offer wonderful views of the capital on the other bank.
Lisbon should only be around thirty minutes away by car or boat.But the immediate vicinity of the base also has its stimuli.For hikes in nature, for example, the Samouco Salins, where flamingos and birds of other species can be found.
However, birds against aircrafteda begin.Pilots warn of collisions of birds with aircraft.Environmentalists and local politicians believe that many people in the relatively densely populated surroundings of the new airport would have to adjust to a high noise pollution.
An older couple wears this with humor."We are already used to the noise of Fiat and F-16," the man jokes during the conversation under the lemon tree in the front garden of his row house, "and as old people we sleep little anyway.“A headmaster fears that he would have to interrupt the lessons when jets start or land.
Meanwhile, real estate prices are getting up before the aircraft.Although the time for examining any problems was not scarce, the essential environmental study on the civilian use of Montijo is still not available.But the Portuguese government is in a hurry, especially since the capacity of the current airport inaugurated in 1942 has long been exhausted.
In 1975 he had around 4 million passengers, around 8 million in 1998, already 15 million in 2012 and over 29 million.Because the airport is as good as in the urban area, the possibilities of expansion are limited.Good
Thing wants to have a while in Portugal.As early as 1969, a “quick” solution to the intolerable conditions was officially promised.Twice in the past twenty years, governments have announced concrete plans for the closing of the current airport and the construction of a completely new airport.
It was to be built only 45 kilometers north of Lisbon on the former air force base of OTA, then instead on an Air Force in the east of the Air Force, over 30 kilometers east.However, local politicians and the tourism industry clung to the airport close to the city.And then all new buildings were postponed out of money.
The state still doesn't have money.In the crisis year 2013, he sold the national airport operator Ana to the French group Vinci.The latter now wants to build the air castle without state funds, with a fraction of the sum that would cost a completely new project.
Topping cross in the offside "This is the solution that has to be implemented now," said Prime Minister Antonio Costa in January when the government and Vinci signed the contract for financing - without waiting for the environmental study.Costa was accused of wanting to create completed facts.By 2028, Vinci is expected to spend 1.15 billion euros in to increase the capacity of Lisbon a bit and to equip Montijo for the inclusion of civil flights.
If Lisbon Airport can now handle 38 starts and landings per hour alone, Lisbon and Montijo should be able to do 72 movements together.The conversion in Lisbon with the decommissioning of one of the two slopes - this to create more parking space - should definitely go ahead.But what happens if Montijo falls through?
A finished airport with all the trimmings is already available in Beja, 170 kilometers south of Lisbon, where an air force base has been open to civilian traffic since 2011 and even the huge Airbus 380 can land.Only this airport is hardly used because it is too far away.Local politicians in Mittelportugal also repeatedly advocate the civilian use of the base of Monte Real, 150 kilometers north of Lisbon.
After all, the Pope landed there on his pilgrimage to Fatima.The Montijo military base, which is located opposite Lisbon on Tejo, is said to become the most beautiful airport in the world.C. Costa / Imago

Boeing and faa come under pressure / / ps.New York ·
After the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 within five months, both the aircraft manufacturer and the American aviation supervision FAA are under pressure.According to media reports, the American Ministry of Transport has been investigating whether the authority has used suitable standards when the middle -distance jet was admitted.According to the Wall Street Journal, the Ministry of Justice is also dealing with the accident.
The “Seattle Times” reported at the weekend that the FAA made 8 mistakes when admissioning the 737 max.Security experts also question whether the pilots have been sufficiently trained for the so -called Masuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which should automatically stabilize the machine at an excessive flight angle.A Boeing spokesman said that the FAA also certified the MCAS according to the relevant requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer has announced that they are improved in the next few weeks.Until then, the 737 Max, which has been delivered since 2017, remain on the ground.The Boeing share, which had already lost more than a tenth since the crash ten days ago, noted 2 % weaker on Monday.
2019
U.S. justice suspects the aviation authority and Boeing of the sloppiness / / flight safety, which suffers from the lack of personnel and money, due to the lack of Boeing 737 Max is in trouble.
The American judiciary have now alerted alleged defects in a Boeing 737 Max flight control system.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, a Washington court has requested internal documents, including emails and further correspondence between the aircraft manufacturer and the US Aviation Aviation Administration (FAA).If, after an evaluation of the documents of suspicion of sloppiness and error in the approval of the aircraft, public prosecutor's investigations and charges could follow.
The step is unusual.Usually the educational work in flight accidents is left to the specifically responsible authorities, the criminal justice rarely intervenes on its own - and certainly not in such an early stage of the analysis.The fact that she still does it makes it clear how big the worry is that Boeing and the FAA slapped when the aircraft was approved.
The group and the authority, on the other hand, emphasize that the certification has expired as usual.Two Boeing 737 Max 8 machines had crashed within the last five months - first an aircraft from the Indonesian Lion Air on October 29, 2018, then a jet of the Ethiopian Airlines on March 10th.A total of 346 people died.
A global flight ban on the Max series has been in effect since last Wednesday-the FAA had decided to this as the last of the large aviation authorities.In the Lion-Air disaster, the so-called Masuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) played a crucial role in accordance with the interim report of the Indonesian flight safety authority.The Ethiopian Ministry of Transport spoke on Sunday that the course of the second crash in parallels for the first time.
The French flight accident investigation Bea had downloaded the content of the voice recorder and the flight data recorder and handed over to the Ethiopian colleagues.Planned value exceeded had been introduced at the latest version of the 737 to minimize the aerodynamic differences to the previous model for the pilots.The engines of the jet are larger, heavier and attached further on the wing.
In certain flight areas, McAs pushes the aircraft down to prevent a flow of flow and thus prevent a loss of buoyancy.According to a report by the “Seattle Times”, the FAA MCAS, as proposed by Boeing, approved, although there were defects.According to a document, MCAS should only be able to adjust the altitude that is decisive for the flight position by a maximum of 0.6 degrees.
In fact, up to 2.5 degrees are possible - more than four times the planned value.However, it is not listed in the documentation that MCAS once again automatically intervened after the pilot's countermeasure.However, this is crucial because the maximum rash can be achieved very quickly.
Another serious accusation: MCAS only draws his data from a sensor.Boeing apparently justified this with the fact that the system is not a centrally safety -relevant part of the control - then at least one other sensor for data comparison would be prescribed.However, this argument ignores that MCAS can very well become a danger to flight safety if, as with Lion-Air flight 610 or allegedly at Ethiopian 302, the data is not correct.
At least when it comes to the Lion-Air crash, another factor has played an important role: the pilots simply didn't know which system pressed the nose down and that they could easily have turned it off.Boeing is accused of not having informed customers and pilots enough about MCAS to save the airlines higher costs for the training of their crews and to make the 737 Max more attractive in the competition with the Airbus A320neo.
Pressure on engineering media for the current preliminary examinations of the judiciary relate to the role of the FAA.According to the “Seattle Times”, this sloppy in the certification of the 737 Max and even delegated the approval of critical systems to Boeing.FAA engineers who insisted more precisely analyzes had been urged by the management level of the aviation authority to speed up the procedure.
The FAA has long been suffering from a lack of staff and tight budgets.At the same time, the requirements are getting bigger because the aircraft to be granted have become increasingly complex.It has therefore been common for years that the FAA delegates part of their work to Boeing employees.
So far, particularly safety -relevant systems have been largely excluded.Jens Flottaudia US Air Force Authority delegates part of her work to Boeing employees.Photo: Joshua Roberts (Reuters)

The autonomous flight taxis come!/ / Andreas Engel experts agree:
We will previously sit through the air with autonomous drones than in self -driving cars.At the Daimler annual press conference, CEO Dieter Zetsche announced in February: «Together with the start-up company Volocopter, we are developing mobility in the third dimension.Our flight taxis start in Singapore this year.»
It will take time for the service to be real across the board."Yes," says Zetsche, "The prerequisites for a successful future can be achieved in the present." Daniel Guffarth, head of study and mobility expert at the management consultancy Horváth & Partners (D), predicts a great future: "In 2025, flight taxis will beTransport passengers in large cities on defined routes.»
Flight taxis could bring relief, especially in megacitys who suffocate in rush hour traffic.The startup Volocopter from Bruchsal (D) is a leader in the development of vertical electrical multicopters as air taxi.In addition to Daimler and other companies, the chip giant Intel (USA) has entered as an investor.
Cooperation was also agreed with Frankfurt Airport (D). "Together we are developing concepts for soil infrastructure and operation of flight taxis at airports," says Yi-Chun Sandy Chen, spokeswoman for digitization and service topics, "Volocopter ports could be hubs in citiesConnecting - a connection from and to the airport should also be checked. »Volocopter was the first company in 2018 to be admitted to manned electric flights and flew an unmanned two -way passer for the first time.The double -seater 2x has 18 rotors, with which it should only be as loud at a height of 75 meters as a small helicopter at 500 meters.
Range: 27 kilometers.In order for science fiction to become a reality, such autonomous drone flights must be affordable.Volocopter has already calculated flight prices.
For the six minutes from Stuttgart Airport (D) to neighboring Bietigheim-Bissingen, 65 francs would be equivalent.With a conventional car taxi, you pay just over 100 francs under the cheapest conditions for 30 minutes.Hamburg (D) is also a test area for the small electrical -powered vertical starters from Volocopter.
With them, the way from the airport to the city center would only take three instead of at least 30 minutes today and cost around 35 euros.Line traffic is expected to be possible from 2025.Quiet, autonomous and even cheaper than a conventional taxi:
As early as 2025, drones such as the Volocopter are to solve traffic chaos in metropolises.View from the cockpit of the Volocopter 2x to the metropolis of Dubai.Air taxi from Switzerland lucerne - not only in Germany, autonomous flight taxis is being researched, but also in Switzerland:
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has completed a first successful test flight with the help of the Swiss subsidiary Aurora Swiss Aerospace from Lucerne.The electrical air taxi, which visually reminds of a small plane, should be able to cover distances of up to 80 km and offers space for up to four passengers.First test flight of the Boeing flight taxis in January 2019.

They have just celebrated the sweet poison of the old successes / / by E. A. Murphyda, the aircraft manufacturers from Seattle with their 737 Max, the most successful transport aircraft ever.5000 orders are in the books with a total value of around $ 600 billion.
And now the two accidents that the company expects.Boeing boss Muilenburg was only worth one of lawyers chewed and compensated for the stock market that Boeing looks even worse.The passengers, on the other hand, have long turned when looking at the ticket when they realize that they have to fly again with Boeing's old box and their narrow seats.
She will follow this fate for decades.With a lifespan of at least 25 years and such a work stock, it will still take at least 50 years for the 37 books to become less.But this also means that the aircraft will remain in operation for 100 years in its variants.
As if you were to cover around in the pissed Ford-T today, like Laurel and Hardy once.This has long been the case in the military.The B-52 bombers of the United States and their Russian counterpart, the Tupolev 95, will probably crack the 100-year border.
High-tech is said to be 100 years old, these aircraft are in the golden industrial age of the 1950s and 1960s.Boeing only developed the four -beamed 707, then the three -jet 727 between 1957 and 1968 and the huge 747 came as a further reduction.All machines were invented by the same creative minds, with impressive technical self -confidence and at an unimaginably short intervals today.
The engineers at the time were so good that Boeing wants to live for 100 years of their work, with a few modifications, of course.This is dangerous, as it turns out.If the management is of the opinion that you can always modernize the old climmer minimally and then it does so for the next 20 years, the company loses its technical competence.
Then all ideas that go beyond status-quo maintenance are wiped off the table with "too expensive", "too complicated", "certification" or "unnecessarily".Even those companies that are great "innovation" on their flags run away from the creative minds.Pushing up instead of starting the start does not only apply to Boeing.
There were 15 years between the 777 and 787.In contrast to the 1960s with four new aircraft types in ten years, the 777 program in the 787 program was hardly anyone in the same place.90 percent of the experience is stored in the heads and nowhere is written down.
This experience is only preserved with short, intensive product cadence.In the meantime, the old metal administrators in Seattle no longer know how to build good new planes, but only how to get a little more out of the old ones.The problem is not only in aircraft construction.
In almost all areas of technology, developments have slowed themselves down in recent years.The names such as “Classic” or “proven” increase inflationarily.In many companies, “Heritage Products” make up between 95 and 100 percent of production.
The decision to squeeze out a little more out of the old product and continue to postpone a new development is easier than the start of a new project.And then you are surprised that suddenly a software update is no longer enough to hide entrepreneurial laziness and the disadvantages of ancient technology.The wake -up call does not have to be as tragic every time with Boeing with over 346 deaths.

Leftists demand ban on domestic flights / / from Fabian Renzbern.
Every day, an average of 1700 women and men cover the route between Zurich and Geneva on the air.It is the most popular among the Central Swiss flight routes, it contributes to the considerable number of domestic flyers: According to the Federal Statistics Office, the aircraft is used for trips within the national borders annually.
If it is based on the Basel SP national councilor Samira Marti, these numbers are now drastically reduced: to zero.“The Federal Council is commissioned to create the necessary legal bases so that air travel is prohibited in Germany.“So it is in a motion that Marti submitted at the end of last week, supported by around a dozen members of their faction.
A flight from Zurich to Geneva produces 150 times more CO2 than a train journey on the same route, argue the signatories.Domestic flights are absurd and unnecessary because Switzerland has "one of the best rail infrastructures worldwide".For this reason, a ban should be issued-and only to be lifted again if there are at best new flight techniques with a deeper CO2 emissions.
The left is launching a discussion that has already started in Germany and has taken on a speed in the course of the climate debate.The prominent Berlin mobility researcher Andreas Knie caused a sensation last autumn when he demanded the attitude of the German domestic flight market - which is unequally larger compared to Switzerland.Last month, the Bavarian Greens rode an attack against Lufthansa.
The reason for this was the flight connection, which the airline maintains on the 150 -kilometer route from Nuremberg to Munich.Swiss defends the Lufthansa, of course.
And the Swiss, which offers the majority of Swiss domestic flights, is also opposed to the ban required by the left.The company sees the flights from Zurich to Geneva and Lugano as a contribution to the national cohesion: It is therefore offered an "optimal connection to the most important departure waves from Zurich", a spokeswoman said.
“In the event of a loss, it would have to be assumed that the passengers switch to adjacent airports in nearby countries.»This would affect added value in Switzerland and bring no benefit to the climate.Samira Marti should not be easy to find a majority for her motion.
The advance seems broadly supported within the SP faction.Local from airport regions also signed him, such as Priska Seiler Graf, City Councilor from Kloten (ZH).Resistance can be expected from a bourgeois side.
The Schaffhauser SVP National Councilor Thomas Hurter, for example, speaks of "classic paving lipolitics".At the moment it is very fashionable to want to do something for the climate with advances.In fact, domestic flights made up only a very small part of the flight movements.
«And I remind you of which outcry was when Swiss stroked the most long -haul flights from Geneva a few years ago.“If you capture the flight connection to Zurich, the Geneva will feel, says Hurter.After all, the city is the location of many international organizations.
The relocation goal is required, however, that the new SP motion could pave the terrain for concepts that are perceived as less radical.For example, Thomas Hardegger, SP National Councilor and President of the Rümlang (ZH) airport community hopes for this.He basically finds the proposal for a domestic flight ban.
However, he considers the approach of a fundamental “shift policy for short -haul flights” to be promising.Hardegger recommends using the strategies for freight traffic.Accordingly, he calls for an “relocation target” for the air travel in Germany.
The Federal Council will now be the next to Martis Motion.A positive statement is hardly to be expected;The government rejects the “shift policy” required by Hardegger.

Choose green in Zurich and fly on happily / / Werner Enz · This weekend the Zurich voters gave green parties a lot of upswing.
The topic of environmental protection will continue to gain weight.In an eye -catching contrast to this growing concern about global global warming, it now states that growth is unbroken, especially in aviation.Last year, Zurich Airport made a record with over 31 million passengers.
In January and February of this year, upward development with traffic growth continued by 5.8 % in January and then 3.4 % in February.The robust pre-bookings for Swiss flights and the publication of the summer flight plan of the Zurich Airport, which have just been published, also show no weakening.The Swiss is expanding its offer on certain European routes;
So new Gdansk (Gdansk) is flown four times a week.Edelweiss Air is new to Tirana.The Destination Ohrid in Macedonia will then be operated up to twice a week.
Germania flies twice to Tirana after the change of ownership and once a week to Calvi in Corsica.It is more important that Eurowings visits Mallorca five times a week from Zurich Mallorca.Air Serbia will even fly 19 times a week from the end of March to October 26, the last day of the summer flight plan.
And British Airways increases the flights to London by 5 to 26 flights a week.A lot is happening on the long distances: Cathay Pacific is now using the Airbus A350 - 1000, which will mean more of 59 seats per flight - and less CO2 load per seat.
Icelandair and Air Canada will also increase the cadence of flights to Reykjavik or Vancouver.It is still unknown when the Swiss will fly two new destinations in America and Asia with their Boeing 777.It will be interesting to see which means to fight the CO2 emissions by which Swiss.

Convicted of a hypothetical crash / / Michael von Ledeburan can be condemned someone for a mistake that has remained without consequences?This question is currently moving the Swiss air traffic industry and especially the SkyGuide air traffic control.
These were again present in large numbers on Thursday when one of those who stood in front of the Bülach district court.For the third time within around a year, a air traffic manager was guilty of a court of negligent public transport disorder, even though nobody was harmed.This is a worrying accumulation from the perspective of the Skyguide managers.
If your employees were in prison with a leg when they were doing their job, this would be highly problematic, according to the tenor on the sidelines of the negotiation.The topic should not be underestimated.It could even have an impact on flight operations.
An incident of August 22, 2012 was negotiated between a passenger machine and a sports plane.The pilot of the sports aircraft, a flight student accompanied by a flight instructor, had landed on the slopes 16 of the Zurich airport for training purposes and wanted to start again.The now 48-year-old pilot had approved this and at the same time gave a passenger machine from Darwin Airline on slopes 28.
The two slopes crossed.The planes subsequently came to 256 and vertically up to 30 meters, with the sports aircraft turning in a sharp right -hand bend.In addition, the crew of the passenger machine, alarmed by the collision warning system on board, increased the risen.
No “almost collision” after the guilty verdict could be read in online media of a near-collision.However, a collision did not threaten.The life of the 15 passengers and 3 crew members was never in danger anyway.
If so, the two occupants of the sports aircraft would have been endangered, but according to the court, this was not the case either: the sports aircraft could turn off in good time without getting into air vertebrae that the passenger machine generated.The evasive maneuver was harmless.
The fact that there is still a guilty verdict has to do with the peculiarities of the Criminal Code.The absence of the damage does not protect the accused from punishment if the damage was only averted by happiness or the skillful action of a third party.The relevant couple of terms is called “Chance and prudence”.
The court is therefore encouraged to devote themselves to hypotheses.In the case of the sports aircraft, it was about the behavior in the cockpit and the time of instruction by the air traffic controller.The flight instructor had testified that her attention had already been awakened when the pilot dropped his radio message.
She accidentally listened to another radio message in which STOPS 28 was mentioned.In addition, she found that the passenger aircraft had set in motion on slopes 28.The court rated this as a chance.
In addition, it is thanks to the prudence of the flight instructor that the situation ended lightly.This initiated the right -hand bend immediately after receipt of the pilot instructions instead of first acknowledging the instructions.Otherwise, the sports plane would have only shot four seconds later.
Then there would have been a risk that the aircraft would have been disrupted by the air vertebrae of the passenger machine and crashed.The danger was therefore out of the question for the court, as well as negligence.With its instructions, the pilot created an unnecessary risk.
There are no understandable reasons for the start release to the passenger machine.Controversial invoicing The court had finished his statements, the accused turned to his chair and said: “Exactly.Exactly .
»Of course, the words did not apply to the verdict.Rather, a judge in the three -person college and the clerk represented a minority opinion and made it public - an extraordinary process.
The clerk described the assumptions on which the judgment is based as speculative.«The expert simply had the actual flight delayed by four seconds.»But that is too easy.
Four seconds later, the pilot of the sports plane might have chosen another route.The pilot of the passenger plane might have reacted differently.A threat cannot be proven.
In addition, it was no coincidence that the flight instructor was aware.The pilot's mentally present are part of a network of measures that ensured security in air traffic."It cannot be a coincidence if one reaches." The air traffic manager will contest the judgment before the higher court.
The incident will deal with him another year six and a half years ago.The court prompted the long period of proceedings to a sharp complaint to the address of the Zurich Unterland public prosecutor.This delayed the case to wait for the judgment in another case.
In addition, she initially submitted a defective report.All of this is "difficult to understand".This is the second current pilot with an overhanging procedure.
Due to the delay in the damage of the accused, the court lowered the punishment for a minimum: instead of 270 daily sentences, it imposed 90 francs.The prosecutor had called for 420 daily rates, the defender an acquittal.
It was undisputed from the start that the punishment should be due.The man remains skyguide.The teachings have long since expressed their displeasure through the verdict.
"Once more was judged by hypotheses," says spokesman Vladi Barrosa.The teachings have long been drawn from the incident: Such a training flight was no longer allowed according to today's operating regulations.
Nevertheless, he employs the judiciary.That is only conceivable in Switzerland.«In all areas we take on EU law on an ongoing basis, of all things in the air traffic control we are going to take a special train.»
Not only skyguide recognized the explosiveness of the recent judgments, but also aviatic partners such as the airport or the Swiss.As an option, a change in the aviation law is in the room.When Airport Zurich AG recently presented its years, a journalist Stephan Widdig confronted with the scenario that Skyguide could drastically reduce the operating capacity with reference to security and new court practice.
It didn't go into this.Barrosa currently does not comment on Barrosa.However, the explosive force of the problem is obvious.
Judgment DG 180018, not yet final.The slope cross always leads to delicate situations at Zurich Airport.

Skyguide pilot spoken guilty / / judgment the district court
Bülach condemned an air traffic manager because two machines came dangerously close to the Klotener slopes.The judges caused a sensation.Pia Wertheimerdas Bülacher District Court caused a small sensation in the trial of a pilot from Skyguide:
It not only opened his guilty verdict on Thursday, but also the view of the court's minority, which would have acquitted the man.Even veteran Rolf Jäger, who represented the indictment as head of the Winterthur / Unterland public prosecutor, has never experienced this.
It sometimes happens that the different minority opinion is noted in the protocol."However, it is also a premiere for me that this will be read about an oral pronouncement." But from the front: The court condemned the pilot for negligent public transport disruption.
It took him with a conditional fine of 90 daily rates of CHF 100 and remained under the request of the indictment, which had requested a conditional prison sentence of 14 months.The defense lawyer had requested an acquittal for the man.The incident that led to the process occurred in August 2012:
With a flight instructor, a pilot in a small plane trained vision flights to the slopes of the Zurich airport.In doing so, he briefly put on his sports cruiser and started again.Shortly after the 48-year-old Towerlotse granted the sports cruiser to do that on slopes 16, the crew of a line machine from Darwin Airline reported.
She explained her Saab 2000 at the head of slopes 28, which forms a cross with the slopes 16, as a starting clear.The aircraft with 18 inmates then received the release from the tower pilot.Meanwhile, the sports cruiser turned onto piste 16.
And earlier than expected from the pilot, which shortened the way of the machine - and brought it on a collision course with the starting Saab.The pilot noticed and reacted before the warning system in the tower: first he ordered the Sportcruiser crew to fly a full circle and five seconds later a steep curve to the right.
The Saab crew-alarmed by the collision warning system on board-increased the risry rate of its machine.The incident went off lightly.Too many speculation for two of the three district judges it was clear that there was no danger to life and life thanks to the “prudent reaction” of the flight instructor in the sports cruiser.
She had set the right curve ordered by the air traffic controller before she had acknowledged its command - a order that was not common in normal flight operations.The two judges argued that the four seconds won in this way played an important role: If the flight instructor had first confirmed the instruction of the air traffic controller and only then started the maneuver if the sports cruiser would have got into the downcoming SAAB.
This would have meant a "considerable risk of falling" and endangered the life of the inmates.That was the third judge and the clerk, who plays an advisory role in finding the judgment, too much speculation.They took the view that the risk of falling was based on a very hypothetical course of action.
It was clear to them that there was no danger because the interaction of everyone involved worked.The "security nets" would have taken up what was "no coincidence" after the ordinary run of things in air traffic.With his judgment, the Bülach court remained far below the penalty required by the public prosecutor.
Because: Since the incident, six and a half years have been in the country, which the court president described as "difficult to understand" and as "serious intervention" into the life of the accused.Prosecutor Jäger "but can live with the judgment"."We see the long procedure too," he says.
It is a fact that had not been used in such cases and without prejudiciums Daure the process of its time.«The future cases will go faster.»Despite the deeper punishment, he wants to accept the verdict - provided that the counterparty does so.
"If she goes into appeal, we will join and apply for a higher punishment," says Jäger.This will probably be the case, because the pilot's defender has announced that this judgment be contested before the higher court.This in turn welcomes the Skyguide air traffic control, because because of the conviction, it sees the major security culture at risk in all high -risk areas.
The idea of learning out of mistakes is based on improve the safety of an entire system.Employees are said to report suspicion - if they have not acted grossly or deliberately and nobody was harmed.Zero error tolerance the pilot union Aerocontrol regrets that so far it has not been possible to "anchor the principle of this culture in the legal process of thinking and making a decision".
"As the judgment shows, legislators and courts do not accept any mistakes in our work environment," says spokeswoman Marianne Iklé.This zero error tolerance is illusory.And: "It threatens the currently high level of security of aviatics." Learning from mistakes:

Two planes almost collided / / / Roggwil above the community there was an almost accommodation between a small and a glider.
The incident occurred on June 30, 2018 last year: A small aircraft and a glider were dangerously close to the Roggwil region at a flight altitude of 2000 meters.This emerges from the report of the Swiss Security Investigation Center (Sust) published on Friday.
She speaks of a "serious incident". The pilot of the propeller aircraft with four places was on the instrument approach to the regional airfield Grenchen.The machine flawed the glider in which two pilots are sitting.The two aircraft approached, as can be read on “BZ Online”, except for a horizontal distance of around 115 meters and up to a vertical distance of approximately 175 meters.
The pilot of the propeller aircraft reported to the air traffic manager that he had just scanned a glider.He saw the glider pilots.Circles in the sky
According to the Sust report, turned pilots later stated that they were not aware that there was a final approach for the approach to Grenchen in the Langenthal area.Therefore, they would not have expected a approach, but would have benefited from good upgrading over Langenthal during minutes in the circle fly.
The transponder was also incorrectly set in the glider.Therefore, no flight heights were transmitted.The Sust states that it was impossible for the air traffic management to give reliable traffic information to the other air traffic participants.
In contrast to the past, information about the approach to the past is no longer published on the official cards, the report continues.This represents “a systematic risk” because airspace users are difficult to access significant information.The glider had started on the Kägiswil OW airfield and the propeller machine on the airfield in Linz, Austria.

Explosive devices, shadows and a shadow / / Marco Kauffmann Bossart, srinagar «Close the sun visor!»The aircraft from Delhi has just set up in Srinagar.
If you looked at the eternal white of four thousands minutes before, the artificial lights go on in the cabin, and the passengers pull down the blinds like the cabin staff.The military airfield next door remains protected from prying eyes.The panels can only be opened again when the machine reaches its stand.
"The ban on photography at the airport can be strictly followed," warns the voice from the loudspeaker.After that, the entertainment system of the Vistara Airlines “What a Wonderful World”, Louis Armstrong Singing in 2018 died in the cashmere conflict;Police, soldiers, extremists, civilians.
It was the highest number of deaths in a decade.The new year also started bloody.In February, a suicide bomber rammed a convoy and tore 46 Indian police officers to death.
As a result, India bombed an alleged training camp for terrorists in Pakistan.Pakistan struck back.In the high valley, the frightened population covered with emergency stocks.
Intervisory makers in the hostile brother countries called for further retaliation.Idyll with reflective lakes “Welcome to Paradise on Earth”, the posters in the reception hall of the airport announce.An employee of the tourist office joyfully jumps from his chair and presses the newcomer a bundle of brochures without being asked.
They show an idyll with reflective lakes and meadows on which horses are amicable on the deep green grass.Due to the tense security situation, the services of the office are rarely used."For tourist, no problem," the employee gives the visitor on the way.
On the road to the center of Srinagar, the largest city in the sub -state of Jammu and Kashmir, the hundreds of security forces are noticed, which often covered faces with a neckerchief, packed their upper body into a bulletproof vest.Police officers stop traffic at intersections, barbed wire cups entire lines of houses.In the lookout of a armored vehicle, a helmeted paramilitar stretches his head, surrounded by a grid cage that would ward off the throwing floors.
Although Kaschmir's part of Kaschmir is officially not a state of emergency, it feels like this.Foreign journalists are only allowed to travel to Kashmir with a special permit.The flight times are just as to be made as the planned reportage topic.
After approval of the request, the correspondent is not allowed to make people who “do activities against the nation” - meant supporters of the independence of Kashmir or the connection to Pakistan.Always the man with the Bartein bearded man with a peaked cap and leather bag has made the order to monitor the NZZ correspondent.He does not want to remain undetected, on the contrary:
The secret service immediately ensures that his presence is noticed.During a five -minute absence of his observatory object, he sits down next to the translator in the hotel lobby and desires to know who to interview.He introduces himself as an employee of the Central Intelligence Division Jammu and Kashmir.
The police's intelligence agency works as the government's ears and eyes, as it is called on the website.For Khurram Parvez from the Human Rights Organization Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, to being listened and spied on.He has to fear for life and life.
In April 2004, when Parvez was traveling as an election observer in his home province, an explosive device hit his vehicle.The driver and a companion died, Parvez suffered serious injuries.After several operations, one leg had to be amputated.
The attack was never informed.With his mission, documenting human rights violations, Parvez got between the fronts.The organization's reports read like a chronicle of horror: Indian officers who rape mothers and daughters of the same family on their hunt for extremists;
Security forces who shoot on demonstrators with pellet rifles and accept that they lose one or both eyes.Parvez also lists how many civilians and security forces kill the extremists.And he complains to the separatists because they refuse to take a negotiating solution.
Parvez receives threatening calls from the extremists who want to separate the predominantly Muslim sub -state from the mostly Hindu India.Meanwhile, the authorities consider Parvez as a nest polluter.In 2016, he caught him border officials in Delhi before he was able to travel to the session of the UN Human Rights Council.
This was followed by 67 days in police custody."I was told me a shame of India's reputation." In 2018, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a report on Kashmir for the first time.This means that the Indian security forces disproportionately applied violence, which resulted in dead and many injuries.
Nevertheless, those responsible would not be held accountable, especially since the so -called Armed Forces Special Powers Act in principle grant the security forces.For Parvez, who works from a small back room in Srinagar, the problem is a fundamental nature: «India believes that democracy is exhausted in elections.»
But there is a right to object.This right is almost out of force in the unrest province.The government is taking repressive states like China as a model in Kashmir.
Investigation, self -contamination climate of fear, self -censorship and intimidation shapes everyday life in Bashir Manzar.He is a journalist at the daily newspaper "Kashmir Images".His office on the second floor of a poorly heated house has no name sign.
From solidarity with two other newspapers in the valley, which the state considered with an advertisement, his publication recently appeared with a white front.«We have no idea why.From one day to the other, the advertisements dried up, »says Manzar and pulls on his cigarette.
The media houses have requested an explanation.They did not receive an official answer.An official referred to orders from the highest position.
The failure of state advertising not only deprives the local media.«The readership lacks official information, for example via examination dates at schools.»Manzar, who also bears his pheran, the traditional cashmere coat, interprets the boycott as a prison campaign for unpleasant newspaper articles.
Manzar is also exposed to threats.In July 2018, he installed surveillance cameras in front of the gate to the office building.He reacted to the murder of a colleague.
This was shot in front of the Press Colony in Srinagar, a road train where many media are quartered.On this day, of all things, the police vehicle, which was otherwise always stationed in the entrance, was missing.The shots of the cameras disappeared in a mysterious way.
A settlement of separatists or state actors?"We are hostile to both sides," says Manzar laconically and taps his left hand with his left hand."We write with scissors in the head." In 1997, militants had banned his newspaper with a ban on publication.
The print shop did not dare to oppose the order from the underground.According to estimates, there were thousands of extremists in the nineties, now there should only be hundreds."However, they have a larger audience through social networks," emphasizes Manzar.
The militants are also more religiously motivated today.In the judgment of many critics, the Indian state is doing far too little to win over the youth of the Kashmirtal.Most terrorists from Pakistan or Afghanistan used to seep.
However, under Indian rule, a generation of violent young people has grown into the home.The 22-year-old suicide bomber of Pulwama, who attacked a convoy of Paramilitaries in February, had been humiliated, beaten up and arrested six times according to his parents, but was then released again without charges.Shah Faesal is a hope of Hope, who believed that he could improve the living conditions in the valley as part of the system.
He brought it to awareness because he achieved the best result for the Indian administration - as the first cashmere ever.India's central government saw a hope of hope in Faesal, who took care of educational and energy projects in Jammu and Kashmir, among other things.But in January 2019 he surprisingly acknowledged his service, "because of the ongoing killings".
In conversation, Faesal shows that he is demoquating from frustration about repression policy and violent escalation.He complains about restrictions on opinion, assembly and freedom of movement.«Kaschmir's youth are now denied legitimate means of expression.
That makes them grab other means. »Faesal had denounced grievances with tweets as top officials, he has now entered politics.In mid-March, the 35-year-old founded a party, the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement.He wants to gain a population layer that has averted disappointed by politics.
A spokesman for the right -wing conservative government party BJP in Srinagar defends the hard course of Delhis."In a conflict zone, the army always has the upper hand," says Khalid Jehangir when asked whether he understands the anger of the Kashmirische Youth.He does not deny the allegations of rape against Indian officers.
However, these cases would be consciously kept.And why are there no final judgments even after many years?"The mills of the Indian judiciary are slowly grinding." From the perspective of the BJP man, the problem is in Pakistan anyway.
«Pakistan makes extremists to India.Without their help, young Kashmirers would not use their weapons, »says Jehangir.However, the bloody attack of February has remembered that the fixation on Pakistan can lead to the security services misjudge the dangers on home. «It 's my duty» The bearded man from secret service remains the whole threeDays on the heels.
"It’s my duty," he once claims.He does his duty.His order only ends at the airport when his observatory object sits in the machine.
Unlike on arrival, the window trends remain open when the machine rolls past the start slope at the military airfield.Apparently an oversight.But instead of looking at the military facilities, most passengers stare at their cell phones anyway.

The drone future comes from Africa / / Andreas Spaethkeenan Wyrobek, founder and chief engineer of the Zipline from California, speaks almost faster than his drones fly.
When he recently stepped in front of the participants of the "Design Indaba" in Cape Town, the most important conference for creative people in Africa, it bubbled out of him.In fact, Zipline has succeeded in an exciting project that could serve future autonomous transport and logistics systems as a model worldwide.And half a world away from areas where such innovations from the Silicon Valley usually celebrate premiere: in Rwanda in East Africa, which is only around two thirds as big as Switzerland.
Rwanda has established itself as an innovation driver, and car companies such as Volkswagen also try out new mobility concepts here.But Zipline is about saving human life.From October 2016, the Californians have built up the world's first and so far nationwide drone delivery system in Rwanda, with which blood sizes in particular can be sent to the whole of the country within minutes.
Eleven million people, even if they live in remote regions, have a quick access to vital donor blood or other emergency medicine in an emergency. «We have just made the one-million flight kilometer mark with over 11,000 flights, our flight performance per week corresponds to each weekA circulation of the earth, we are currently flying up to 60 times with 16 drones a day, »reports Keenan Wyrobek.He is particularly proud that there has not yet been a single accident.The whole thing is so promising that Zipline will now build a similar system on a much larger scale on a much more extensive Ghana in West Africa, and Tanzania in East Africa is also in preparation.
Return to the Heimatder Real quantum leap will be the first project in the home country, the USA.The establishment of a drone network for medical care in North Carolina is already planned there from June.What is still comparatively simple in less densely populated and less commercial air traffic in Africa becomes a crucial question in the USA:
How do you integrate autonomous drones into airspace monitoring via metropolitan areas, and how do you guarantee that they neither endanger people nor other aircraft?Only if these questions are answered convincingly do drones have a chance as a sensible addition to previous logistics chains in industrialized countries.Zipline serves North Carolina as a pilot project to develop and validate practical rules together with the U.S. Air Travel Authority (FAA).
The FAA has specially launched the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program.Today in Rwanda in small format you can already see how this can work.Most of Rwanda is currently connected to medical emergency care from two delivery centers.
Here it depends primarily on speed and therefore as simple as possible.The centerpiece are the specially developed drones themselves, which are more like more aircraft than the quadrocopters, which are often known as drones.However, these would be too slow, they consume too much energy, and they lack the necessary range.
The Zipline drones, on the other hand, are 2.25 meters long, have a span of 3.30 meters, weigh a maximum of 21 kilos and can transport up to 1.75 kilos of payload.The fuselage skeleton is made of high -strength composite material, the outer skin made of easily interchangeable styrofoam.Height rudder and winged wood come from the 3-D printer, the wings are put on the fuselage by hand and inspected by the floor team for functionality via smartphone app and QR codes before the start.
Weight as an enemy of the range are the hardest of the lithium-ion battery packages used by ten kilos, which also contain the GPS unit, which is always switched on, from which the drone receives information about the destination and route.The batteries have a capacity of 1.25 kWh, so the drone could fly for up to two hours.For comparison: the batteries of a Nissan Leaf deliver 24 kWh, that of the Tesla 120 kWh.
Like all systems, the engine and propellers are double in the Zipline drone for safety reasons.It currently takes five minutes from receipt of the order of a hospital until the drone starts with the corresponding delivery.The goal is a minute.
It starts by a ramp, on a sled an electric motor accelerates the aircraft in 0.3 seconds to the travel speed of 101 km / h, a maximum of 128 km / h is possible.The drones follow the terrain at a flight altitude of 100 meters over the ground and can be safely operated in a radius of 80 kilometers from the starting point in any weather, during the day and night.Once at the finish line, you get out your payload, the red box hovers gently to the ground on a paper parachute.
Such delivery currently costs $ 23 in Rwanda.The aircraft then starts the return flight.The landing is spectacular:
Similar to fighter jets that land on an aircraft carrier, the drone has a hook on the rear.It flies straight into a tense cable through GPS and radio sensors that intercepts it and gently brings them to the ground.In ten percent of the cases, this fails the first time the drone will automatically set a new landing test.
The entire flight operations run in automatic coordination with airspace monitoring at the airport in the capital Kigali to ensure that there are no encounters with passenger aircraft."And the Rwandische President insisted on the fact that we install a button with which all drones could be called back in an emergency," reveals Keenan Wyrobek.Rwanda has established itself as an innovation driver, and car companies such as Volkswagen also try out new mobility concepts here.

Despite deep red numbers / / Belp, the new head of the Bern Airport believes that after the Skywork Grounding, line flights from the Belpmoos will be available again.
It also relies on transport drones and electronic flight taxis.At first, however, ten -second jobs fall away.Julian Witschider Airport Bern-Belp has not yet been able to overcome the crisis due to the bankruptcy of the Bernese Airline Skywork.
With Urs Ryf (53), the board of directors has now found a new boss after Mathias Gantenbein's departure.He was a military pilot, a flight instructor at the Air Force and Operative Boss (COO) of the Skyguide air safety company.Since 2017 he has headed the airport operator Swiss Aeropole in Payerne.
Ryf says he is firmly convinced that there is a market for the regional airport Bern.With the right aircraft, individual line flights could also be operated profitably, says Ryf.For example, he thinks of connections to hubs such as Munich or London and the Type Embraer 190 aircraft.
This fits perfectly to Bern with 100 to 110 seats and for a comparatively rather short slopes.Until now, seven months after SkyWork's grounding, no new regular airline could be lured to Bern.Administrative Council President Beat Brechbühl says: «We are and were talking to various airlines.
Many lack very little so that they come to Bern. »Brechbühl demands the commitment and investments of the public sector."For years we have been performing public services as an infrastructure platform that contributes to the region to work and tax substrate, but generated too few income for the airport," says the Board of Directors.It does not follow that everything should be paid by the state in the future.
Rather, he relies on a partnership-based commitment of private and public sector-a private-public partner-hip project.Brechbühl does not give a sum of how much state money the airport needs.However, he records on the fourth expansion stage, which, among other things, is supposed to bring a new roller path and hangars for the SantaViatic.
Brechbühl assumes that the canton's approved investment contributions will be paid out of CHF 2 million of CHF 2 million and the loans spoken according to the new regional policy by a further CHF 2 million.Since SkyWork Grounding, the board of directors has also checked the airport closing, but rejected this extreme scenario.The bankruptcy of Skywork tears a deep hole into the till of the airport.
For 2018 he booked a loss of around CHF 1 million.The figures for the current year are expected to fail to be deep red.The airport therefore announces that the budget will shorten the budget.
Voluntary departures are used for this.However, two employees have to be terminated.Because there is no new airline with a large company in Belp, the airport is looking for new business areas.
So he should develop into a “modern mobility center”.Specifically, buildings and private jobs for new companies on the ground are to be created, for example additional maintenance companies.The Board of Directors also sees potential in the health sector, for example for organ transplant flights or health tourism.
There could also be hangar for business aviation as well as test and certification systems for digital traffic.This means drones, electronic flight taxis and self -driving cars.Sailing group receives the cancellation of the latest plans of the Bern Airport, the Bern Sailing Affairs Group (SG) is also affected.
At the end of March, she received the termination from the airport.According to this, the rental agreement ends after a period of two years in 2021. "We are very disappointed," says President Stefan Zlot.
Beat Brechbühl, President of the Airport, confirmed the termination.«Because we need this space for real estate development, we had to terminate as a precaution due to the deadlines.»The SG is at home in the western part of the airport, here are the hangar, the clubhouse and the grass track.
According to Zlot, twelve glider students are in training at SG.He is combative.«We are firmly convinced that it will continue to be available for our flight school and the association when expanding in Belpmoos.»
Sow in the SG in cooperation with the airport, renovate and reactivate the currently blocked grass track.Finally, there is also a requirement for politics that flight schools and sports flying in Belp can continue to be operated.(Rei)

Report relieves pilots / / addis Abeba The first investigation report to crash the Boeing 737 Max in Ethiopia does not clarify the role of the controversial software.
Jens Flottaudia Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges explained the report yesterday before the media.The Ethiopian civil aviation authority had not published it hours later.
This fueled the suspicion that it was also about defending the behavior of the pilots and thus protecting the airline.How the flight went exactly is still unclear.In the crash on March 10, all 157 people died on board.
The accident was the second of a 737 Max within a few months.On October 29, 2018, a Lion Air machine had crashed in Indonesia and all 189 inmates died.Since March 13th, as a result of the accidents, a worldwide flight ban has been banned from all 737 max.
The Ethiopian Airlines writes in a statement that the report shows that the pilots have followed all the procedures recommended by Boeing."Despite their hard work and although they have followed all emergency procedures, they unfortunately failed to control the aircraft from the permanent descent," said the airline.Above all, the statement that the pilots have followed all prescribed procedures raises the question of whether these procedures were appropriate.
In both crashes, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) played a fatal role.With an extremely high angle of attack, the software should automatically reduce the nose of the aircraft in order to avoid a flow tear.In both accidents, the system apparently reacted due to incorrect data.
When the Lion-Air machine crashed, the crew did not switch off the power supply for the trim of the altitude sector, as required by Boeing.Again and again the McAS could counteract this.The Ethiopian pilots, on the other hand, apparently adhered to the procedures and still lost control.
However, according to information from industry circles, they switched on again.Without the power supply, you have to turn a wheel in the 737 Max to adjust the tail unit and thus move the nose of the aircraft upwards, which requires a lot of strength.Boeing revises the software for MCAS and wants to present it to the US Aviation Aviation Administration for approval in a few weeks.
The update significantly limits the mode of mode of MCAS.In addition, the system should no longer be fed by one but two sensors.Savior at the crash site south of Addis Ababa.

However, according to information from industry circles, they switched on again.Without the power supply, you have to turn a wheel in the 737 Max to adjust the tail unit and thus move the nose of the aircraft upwards, which requires a lot of strength.Boeing revises the software for MCAS and wants to present it to the US Aviation Aviation Administration for approval in a few weeks.
The update significantly limits the mode of mode of MCAS.In addition, the system should no longer be fed by one but two sensors.Savior at the crash site south of Addis Ababa.

Despite deep red numbers / / Belp, the new head of the Bern Airport believes that after the Skywork Grounding, line flights from the Belpmoos will be available again.
It also relies on transport drones and electronic flight taxis.But first there are ten more jobs.Julian Witschider Airport Bern-Belp has not yet been able to overcome the crisis due to the bankruptcy of the Bernese Airline Skywork.
With Urs Ryf, the board of directors has now found a new boss after Mathias Gantenbein's departure.The 53-year-old knows the aviation from many angles: he was a military pilot, flight instructor at the Air Force and operational boss (COO) of the skyguide air safety company.
Since 2017 he has headed the airport operator Swiss Aeropole in Payerne.He also works as a consultant in the aviation industry.When asked why he started the crisis job in the Belpmoos, Ryf says: «I am excited to accept the challenge together with the team.»
He was firmly convinced that there was a market for the regional airport Bern.With the right aircraft, individual line flights could also be operated profitably, says Ryf.For example, he thinks of connections to hubs such as Munich or London and the Type Embraer 190 aircraft.
This fits perfectly to Bern with 100 to 110 seats and for a comparatively rather short slopes.Public funds requested now, seven months after Skywork's Grounding Grounding, no new scheduled airline could be lured to Bern.Administrative Council President Beat Brechbühl says: «We are and were talking to various airlines.
Many are missing very little so that they come to Bern.»He does not name the name.The potential is recognized, but it is a question of risk to risk.
From other cases you know that airlines are demanding co -financing.Brechbühl does not see Bern AG Airport alone.So he also demands the commitment and investments of the public sector.
"For years we have been performing public services as an infrastructure platform that contributes to the region to work and tax substrate, but generated too few income for the airport," says the Board of Directors.It does not follow that everything should be paid by the state in the future.Rather, he relies on a partnership-based commitment of private and public sector-a private-public partner-hip project.
Brechbühl does not give a sum of how much state money the airport needs.However, he records on the fourth expansion stage, which, among other things, is supposed to bring a new roller path and hangars for the smallaviatic (see box).Brechbühl assumes that the canton's approved investment contributions will be paid out of CHF 2 million of CHF 2 million and the loans spoken according to the new regional policy by a further CHF 2 million.
Extreme scenarios rejected the SkyWork Grounding, the board of directors has also checked the closure of the airport, but rejected this extreme scenario.Conversely, it is also not an option for him to rely on cheap airlines and build a new slope.This would be uneconomical and would probably not be realized.
After numerous talks with shareholders, representatives from business and politics and the population, Brechbühl sees the support for being able to continue Bern-Belp as a public regional airport.The bankruptcy of Skywork first tears a deep hole into the till of the airport.For 2018 he booked a loss of around CHF 1 million.
The airport submitted this as a creditor to the bankruptcy manager of Skywork as a claim.The figures for the current year are expected to fail to be deep red.Finally, the income of Skywork is not only missing for four months, but forever.
The airport therefore announces that the job budget will be reduced to 55 full -time positions again by 10.Voluntary departures are used for this.However, two employees have to be terminated.
After SkyWork Grounding, the airport had already painted 10 of 86 jobs at that time.After that, five departures were not replaced and another six dismissals were issued at the end of January.Fifth business stamp after Skywork is not a new airline with such a large company in Belp, the airport is looking for new business areas.
In addition to the line and charter business, he continues to focus on the flights of the federal government, private aviation and the infrastructure required for this.In addition, the Belpmoos should develop into a “modern mobility center”.Specifically, buildings and private jobs for new companies on the ground are to be created, for example additional maintenance companies.
The Board of Directors also sees potential as an airport for the health sector, for example for organ transplant flights or health tourism.There could also be hangar for business aviation as well as test and certification systems for digital traffic.This means drones, electronic flight taxis and self -driving cars.
In addition to these future scenarios, the new airport director Urs Ryf would also like to expand charter traffic.This is not only for holiday travelers from the region in summer.He also sees potential in business with foreign tourists who want to visit the Bernese Oberland.
This in summer and winter.But it would not be the first time that such plans failed.Since the grounding of Skywork, it looks bleak.
Now Bern Airport is looking for new shops.Photo: Franziska Rothenbühler "I am firmly convinced that there is a market for the regional airport Bern." Urs Ryf from July 1, the new director of Bern AG Airport "We are and were talking to various airlines.
Many lack very little so that they come to Bern. »Beat Brechbühl Board of Directors Presidency Fielding Group receives the Termination of the latest plans of the Bern Airport, the Bern (SG) glider group is also affected.At the end of March, she received the termination from the airport.According to this, the rental agreement ends after a period of two years in 2021.
"We are very disappointed," says President Stefan Zlot.Beat Brechbühl, President of the Airport, confirms the termination.«Because we need this space for real estate development, we had to terminate as a precaution due to the deadlines.»
The SG is at home in the western part of the airport, seen from the terminal on the opposite side of the flight track.Here are the hangar, the clubhouse and the grass track of the glider group.According to Zlot, twelve glider students are in training at SG.
Every year, two to three would take a career as a professional pilot.He is combative.«We are firmly convinced that it will continue to be available for our flight school and the association when expanding in Belpmoos.»
In cooperation with the airport, the SG plans to renovate and reactivate the currently blocked grass track.After all, it is also a requirement for politics that flight schools and sports flying in Belp can continue to be operated.Last autumn, the Federal Council replied to an interpellation of FDP National Councilor Matthias Jauslin: Bern-Belp should continue to serve “as far as possible” flight sports and the aircraft training and further education, as is stated in the corresponding subject plan infrastructure.
As far as the future of sports flying is concerned, Brechbühl wants to clarify this question "together with those responsible".However, Zlot's goal is clear: «In 2023 we want to celebrate 100 years of gliding in Belpmoos.»(Rei)

"For me, air traffic control is a state task" / / Michael Rasch, Frankfurtda's last year had it for Michael Eggenschwiler, the chairman of the management of Airport Hamburg GmbH.At the beginning of June, a short circuit caused a serious power failure, so that Airport Hamburg had to stop operating for almost a day.This is the Gau for an airport.
And then the Swiss in Northern German services also received violent criticism, including a resignation from the BUND for the Environment and Nature Conservation Germany and from the airlines for its plans for the airport expansion.He does not know whether his difficult year was in 2018, says Eggenschwiler in an interview.Ultimately, every year is demanding, as the industry and the travel behavior of customers changed constantly.
Criticism about June 3rd, a particularly difficult day was, in retrospect, says Eggenschwiler.That Sunday at around 10 a.m. a short circuit lame the Hamburg Airport - the reopening was only opened the next day.In such a situation, many things are no longer under control.
The sixty -year -old explains that it was only in the late afternoon what exactly was the cause of the power failure.In the basement of the airport, all cables were collected fire -proof, so one could not immediately see whether and where a fire had arisen.Several dozen departures and arrivals had to be canceled on the fifth largest German airport or have failed.
The airport, founded by Hamburg merchants in January 1911, is the oldest airport in Germany.The infrastructure is partly getting old.On the one hand, the renovation of the entire apron, including the brittle concrete, is planned.
With dynamic aircraft guidance in the soil (“Follow the Greens”), the airport can use the areas on the apron more efficiently.On the other hand, the born in Basler also sees a need for action for the terminals.The flights now have a significantly higher occupancy than ten years ago, so that the airport wanted to create more comfort for the guests.
This includes an extension with five new passenger bridges, new bus gates, a renewal of the luggage production facility and modern control devices for the federal police.There was not only excitement about the plans that have been known for years, not only by the conservationists who accused Eggenschwilers of having a secret expansion plan without the necessary permits, and demanding its deduction, but also of the airlines who fear higher fees.According to the Federal Association of German Airlines, Hamburg Airport is building too much infrastructure too early.
Eggenschwiler, on the other hand, considers forward -looking investments to be essential for growth in air traffic.In 2017, the passenger volume was 17.2 million passengers (previous year: 17.6 million) with a good 156,000 flight movements (160,000).The most important approach from Hamburg is Munich (870,000 passengers).
This is followed by Frankfurt am Main (720,000), Palma de Mallorca (410,000) as well as almost equals Zurich and Stuttgart (around 370 000). Honorary consul in the part -time office for an airport chief are diverse.They range from normal operating sequences to clashes with the airlines to challenges from the strikes of the various professional groups that have become more numerous in recent years.Eggenschwiler is well equipped with his training and career.
After studying business administration in St. Gallen with a focus on traffic and tourism, he worked in different positions for the crossair from 1983 to 1991 and from 1991 to 2001 also in different functions for Swissair.After a short intermezzo at a management consultancy in St. Gallen, he moved to Hamburg in 2003, where he was initially managing director for two years and has been the managing director since 2005.A big problem in European air traffic is currently delays.
There are numerous causes for this that are to be found at airports, airports and, last but not least, airspace monitoring.The air traffic control has grown historically and come from national thinking, says Eggenschwiler.The EU covers 27 Member States according to the Brexit, and Switzerland is still in the middle.
However, air traffic control in Europe should be seen as one unit and completely rethought so that the growth of air traffic can be mastered.Air traffic control is also a state task for him, says Eggenschwiler.Any privatization would have to take place radically, which was difficult.
In this respect, a state solution for Europe is easier.The married father of two adult children has never lost contact with Switzerland.As part of numerous subordinates, he is also a fee of Switzerland for Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein.
Although he has not yet replaced mountain hiking by sailing, he still sees his future in the Hanseatic city.Even after his retirement, he will probably stay on the Elbe with his wife, says Eggenschwiler, after all, not only his professional, but also his social network.Michael Eggenschwiler Chairman of the Management of the Hamburg Airport

A hotel for cars / / Belp Two young people want to operate a car hotel for 300 vehicles near the airport.
In addition to discrete parking spaces, the parking hall offers service and repairs.Johannes Reichnoch bears the project of the everyday name P791.The profiles still rise on the green meadow.
But in around a year a hotel for cars will go into operation in Belp.Five floors, 17 meters high, 30 meters wide, 50 meters long.Space for 300 cars.
The construction has already been approved, according to the Belper building management.Behind the idea are two young people from the canton of Bern.She, a woman and a man, do not want to comment on her plans.
Kurt Ryser, who designed the building, provides information."They are based on a request," says the architect about the operators.Service in the house dies, apparently there is especially with owners of classic cars and other expensive and needy cars, possibly also of campers or caravans.
The car hotel offers you a secure parking space for weeks, months or years at constant temperatures around 19 degrees.As can be seen from the building application, customers can deliver their car on the ground floor.Inside the building, the vehicle is then pushed around with various lifts or transported to the upper floors where it can be parked.
The workshop and preparation are also located on the ground floor.In the workshop, spring and winter checks, tire and oil change, carossy work and repairs are done.In the preparation, the car can be polished, waxed, labeled or the leather repaired.
Six to eight people are supposed to work in the car hotel.Land belongs to the city of Bernder location of the car hotel is located on the edge of the Aemmmatt industrial district.
The Alupak company and the yellow commercial home in which the Skywork airline was based are in the immediate vicinity.The airport is also not far.This proximity is accidental, says Ryser.
The city of Bern is the owner of the property.She handed over the country in building law.The construction costs are CHF 7.5 million and also include the development from the Eichholzweg.
As an investor behind the project, entrepreneur Hans-Ulrich Ramseier from the powder coating company Ramseier from Rubigen is standing.Four journeys per space -sized traffic cannot be expected by the car hotel, says Jürg Aebersold from the Belper Building Administration.1,300 trips are expected each year, which makes up a little more than four trips per parking lot.
Accordingly, the cars are likely to be parked on average for several months at a time.The Autohotel building will hardly have windows.The facades are covered with metal, on the roof there is a solar system, a photovoltaic system on the south facade.
"We do without fossil combustion," says architect Kurt Ryser.The building is heated and cooled with groundwater.The start of construction is still for this spring
Planned. "The operators are based on demand." Kurt Ryser architect Autohotelnu in Berndas Autohotel Belp is the first such project in the Bern region.But in Switzerland it is not a novelty.In Central Switzerland, especially in Central Switzerland, there are several car hotels, for example in Küssnacht am Rigi SZ, Rothenthurm SZ, Emmen
Lu, Hinwil ZH and Feusisberg ZH.However, these car boards offer fewer places than are planned in Belp.The prices range between 190 and CHF 350 per vehicle and month and also depend on the service.

Looking to fly / / / civil aviation is the greatest achievement of the last century alongside the computer.Both brought people closer to each other worldwide and gave them unexpected opportunities.
The demonization of the aircraft through the eco -movement is unfounded.By Alex Baurgemäss, a representative survey recently carried out on behalf of the eye, over 80 percent of the Swiss believe that flying is the main cause of climate change immediately after the rainforests were deforested.Both are wrong, objectively wrong - and unseen of whether or not one believes in man -made climate catastrophe.
The destruction of the tropical forests is undoubtedly ugly, threatens biodiversity and promotes erosion, which is reason enough to protect natural reserves.However, the nature of the plants that grow in the Amazon, for example, has no major influence on the nature of the atmosphere.According to the latest satellite measurements by the US space agency NASA, the biomass even increases worldwide, which is not least due to the CO2 concentration in the air, which acts like a fertilizer on plants.
The symbol of the climate-healing and in terms of the global share of flying in CO2 emissions: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), it is just 2.8 percent, and the trend falls.Even if you start from the blackest scenarios of the world climate, Aviatics cannot have a decisive impact on the earth temperature.If you really want to reduce the air pollution, you would have to start with industry and road traffic (around 18 percent of CO2 emissions) and especially in the area of “electricity and heat” (around 40 percent).
However, the climate protesters cannot be put off by such - not -controversial - facts.You have chosen the aircraft as a symbol of the climate revival.Now one may object that the proportion of flying in CO2 emissions would be significant if all people fly as much as the average Swiss does-and that flying is a luxury that could often be avoided.
Why do you have to spend the vacation on the Mediterranean or in Thailand, when there were cozy cookies in the Alps?Is it really necessary to fly to Istanbul, where many students hardly know why there is a monument to General Suworow in the Schöllenenschlucht or an Anna-Göldi Museum in Glarus?And all the business people who jet for tax -free on business costs in the luxury class around the world - isn't that an anachronism in times of video conferences?
These arguments are discussed.What bothers is the messianic fabricity with which they are brought into the field.Just as the car once had to serve as a scapegoat for forest death, the plane is badly talked about.
All the advantages and freedoms that have given human flies suddenly are no longer worth anything.The technical progress is also ignored, with which the ecological balance of flying has been massively improved over the decades.And this development is far from over.
Paradoxically, the attacks against flying threaten the positive achievements instead of promoting them.Because the steering taxes and regulations now required will not prevent people from flying, they will only affect the efficiency of flying.In the 1960s, the airlines calculated with 6.3 liters of fuel per passenger on 100 kilometers of flight.
This value has practically halved.For example, Swiss showed an average consumption of 3.19 liters last year.In some cases, it is due to technical improvements: more efficient engines, better aerodynamics, new and lighter materials, larger aircraft.
On the other hand, thanks to the flexible tariffs, the occupancy of the flights was increased from 54 percent to over 80 percent today, according to the International Air Transport Association IATA.The cheap airlines in particular lowered prices and thus the consumption per passenger with the improvement occupancy.Unwanted side effects increased in aviation in aviation is primarily thanks to the decay of the IATA price cartel and the deregulation of air traffic at the end of the last century.
In the open competition, the privatized airlines had to come up with something, which led to an increase in efficiency.Ecology and economy, it was once again shown, do not contradict if you allow the free market.In the course of the climate apanics, however, even supposedly liberal forces such as the NZZ ("Flying is too cheap", edition of March 20, 2019) are calling for penalty taxes in accordance with the freedom shocked by the latest election results.
The citizen should be spurred on the joy of flying via wallet.Viewed superficially, the cheap formula may illuminate.But such market interventions always have undesirable side effects, which unfortunately cannot be found on any package insert.
CVP Councilor Beat Vonlanthen (FR) has shown in which direction it could go: CHF 20, CHF 40 or 70 Eco buses per flight, graded after short, medium and long distance, twice or triple for business and firstClass passengers are supposed to raise the citizen to aviatic moderation.However, it is doubtful that such amounts prevent people from flying.If you buy a normal ticket, you hardly do without a trip because of such a surcharge.
He would take the buses-perhaps with his fist in the sack, because he promises to enclose the bad climate conscience-grinding your teeth.At most, the bargain hunter would do without the flight, in which such an amount may be important.But there are therefore no fewer flights.
Because the discount offers only fill machines that fly anyway.The result of such a linear CO2 tax would be at most a poorer utilization of the planes that none serves.In order for a CO2 tax to be effective, it would have to make flying extremely more expensive.
Rich would hardly scratch that.You would then be again in the oh so old -fashioned jet set among your peers.The immigrant, on the other hand, would rather do without the home visit to Pristina, the student on the trekking tour in Patagonia and the tram meal on the beach holiday in Bodrum.
For the consolation, the poor swallow a refund from the CO2 pot.What is advertised as a social blessing can also be understood as an attack on social peace: flying would be privilege of the more.
But the bonzen arrogance that is hidden behind the redistribution model is not the only weak point.The steering levy would not only lead to bureaucratic frictional losses, but would also lead to standing runs and loss of efficiency in aviation.Inefficiency does not lead to less, but to more emissions.
Already today, the airlines control their costs via sophisticated computer programs that calculate the cheapest route for each flight.Depending on the weight and meteorological conditions, the optimal flight height, speed and route is selected.This saves considerable amounts of kerosene.
However, the taxis for the use of airspace and airports are also taken into account in this invoice.And if the taxes and fuel duties are higher than the savings in consumption, sub -optimal routes are selected.Such incentives already exist today that they are reinforced by CO2 taxes.
If Switzerland introduced noticeable taxes on the flight canosin, this would have the consequence that if possible, fueled elsewhere or long -haul flights were to be moved to other destinations.Instead of flying directly to New York, Tokyo or South Africa from Switzerland, passengers would have to change more on a so -called hub abroad.Adventurous flight of flights introduction of a fuel tax throughout Europe would simply result in the airlines tend to switch to hubs in North Africa, Eastern Europe or in the Middle East.
An intermediate landing for refueling would also be conceivable.This tendency can already be observed today.The European Destinations have long been competing with cheap fuel.
The detour is arduous and ecologically absurd.But he pays off.These countries would thank the Europeans for the tax policy and certainly not follow suit.
One or the other passenger might actually fly a little less if the trip became more expensive, more complicated and more difficult.But the harassment would hardly lead to a reduction in emissions.If fewer passengers fly detours in less well -booked machines, the environment falls by the wayside.
Anyone who has experienced the adventurally intricate flight routes of the Soviet Union - they may still rest in peace - can sing a song about it.Instead of creating barriers, you should rather optimize the flight routes.This saved tons of uselessly burned fuel.
For two decades in Europe, there have been efforts to combine national airspace controls under one roof, the Single European Sky (SES).American airspace serves as a model.Environmentally friendly alternative to autoob welfare
The American air control with half as many flights with half as many flights as all 27 European systems together, causes 74 percent less delay.Not only the passengers benefit from this.If a flight from the start to landing is planned and coordinated on a central computer system, the air routes can be optimally managed, detours and queues are avoided.
This also saves thousands of tons of kerosene.Central computer control even makes it possible to guess an airliner in a contemporary slide in satellite (Continuous Descent Approach, CDA for short).The gentle approach saves the airline fuel and the residents a lot of noise.
The EU has managed to integrate the internal European flights into a complicated trade in CO2 certificates.In addition to bureaucratic strands, almost nothing has been done.The SES airroom, originally planned for 2020, that would have brought real savings, was misunderstood in an indefinite period.
It is not due to Switzerland, which is well integrated in European air traffic.On the contrary, the Confederation was even involved in the SES project.The problem is the British and the Spaniards, who do not like to agree on the status of Gibraltar, as well as the French air traffic controllers who are enthusiastic about strike who worry about their privileges.
With fuel consumption of less than three liters per passenger per hundred kilometers, the aircraft may be a more environmentally friendly alternative to the car and even the railroad.The train not only depends on the utilization of the trains, but also on the type of power supply.In Germany, for example, where electricity is largely generated with coal or gas, the passenger quickly gets a better ecological balance in a full plane than in a half -empty train.
Sankt-Florians principle In the case of aircraft noise, it should be noted that the crow flies is usually around a third shorter than the route covered on the floor.What is also happy to be forgotten when calculating the ecological balance: the aircraft does not need any streets, no tunnels, no viaducts, no route and no power lines, with whose construction and maintaining huge amounts of CO2 are released.Air routes do not have to be cleared and salted in winter, unlike railway lines, they do not burden residents with fine dust.
Starting and landing slopes may seem great, but, measured by streets and railway routes, the land wear of the flying is a noise.Even with noise, the aircraft cuts better overall than the car or rail.Once they are at the height of travel, you can hardly hear modern jets anymore.
In the area of the airports, aircraft noise is an annoyance.However, the problem is often more due to the Sankt Florians principle than the effective stress.While railway and street noise are distributed across the country and thus all brew more or less equally, the aircraft noise affects only a few communities.
Most affected people also like to fly themselves.They are only annoyed that they have the noise and not the others.Windy politicians, who of course also do not want to do without the plane, manage the envy factor for zero tariff.
The fact is: the effective aircraft noise has massively decreased in the past few decades despite a lot of political noise and increased traffic volume.The emissions of a modern jet are lower than six times the first jet aircraft by 25 decibels.Another halving is considered technically feasible.
CDA-controlled landings can hardly be heard.The starts of large airliners are still noisy.But here, too, gentle procedures, which at least reduce the sound radius, have long been standard.
However, politics has also found a trick here to manage the residents' displeasure: it explains the number of people affected by the aircraft noise.And despite all the noise reductions, this number increases in many places, including in the Zurich region.
The contradiction explains from the fact that the noise apparently does not prevent people from pulling close to the airport.Similar to the inner cities, where the main accompanies complain about the road traffic, experience has shown that the long -established residents in the area of the airports are just a shoulder twitch if you appeal to noise: Who does not like it,
Please make it comfortable elsewhere.But the Zurich Airport region is booming.This trend towards the airports can be determined worldwide, and it is symptomatic for the double morality, which dominates the flying debate: whoever stains against frequent flyers and demands restrictions usually means the others.
A survey by the suspicious research group elections (the institute also creates the election forecasts for ZDF) in Germany from 2014 has shown that it is the voters of the Greens - that is, the party that is mostly demonized and fighting flying -They fly more themselves than all other political groups.The pattern is reminiscent of the pedophile priest, who condemns the devilish temptations in front of the altar.
The phenomenon is known from psychology: a behavior is fought publicly that you consider to be reprehensible, but you do not want to do without voluntarily.If so, one says, then the others should do without or at least pay for their frequency.
The fact that the green flight opponents in the statistical average are among the better earners makes the indulgence payment to be bearable for them.After all, you can afford it.First Class is in these circles
MUSTMAN cannot accommodate such a double standards for all eco -activists.Many of them undoubtedly mean it seriously and go ahead with the good example from their point of view.However, this rarely applies to the leaders of this movement.
Tens of thousands of researchers, activists, lobbyists and politicians Jetten Jahraus, year around the world, from one congress to the next to save the climate.The UN officials who lead this colossal move are usually not content with the business class.First Class is a must in these circles, as the writer was able to determine on the occasion of a report on the World Climate Summit in Lima (World Week No. 50/14, "There are many flight miles").
These people see themselves as an elite and do not like to mix under the common people.After all, they are in an important mission: they have to fly a lot, not because they want, but so that the others no longer fly as much.
If you follow this logic, flying is an evil that can only be justified by the good cause.But who actually determines which purpose is good?It is really bad if simple people can afford a very profane trip to the sea;
When a school class dens into a distant city;When a guest worker travels home for a family party or a student for a weekend to New York? ”Whoever teaches people”, predicted Friedrich Nietzsche over a hundred years ago, «he has all the border stones;All boundary stones themselves will fly into the air, the earth will be baptized - as 'the light' "(" So spoke Zarathustra ", chapter 66).
The German philosopher has not exaggerated.He guessed that a completely new dimension would be opened up with aviation.The aircraft has brought people closer to their origins, breed or religion, worldwide in a way that was hardly imaginable beforehand.
In addition to the computer, it was the most revolutionary technological achievement of the past century.Post and shipping have probably provided global standards and an international exchange much earlier.In chronicles and travel reports, Nietzsche was able to move around the globe virtually.
But he had realized that it was something else to physically overcome the distances and borders.Nothing changed about that .The video conference and online research cannot replace direct human contact.
However, eco -Fundamentalists are already targeting the Internet.The NZZ recently announced in a large report (“Streaming is the new fly”, edition of April 16, 2019) on the front page that according to new calculations, the Internet is said to be responsible for 3.7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions due to its high electricity requirementsbe .This is even more than is attributed to flying.
According to NZZ, streaming videos is particularly environmentally stressful.It is probably only a matter of time before a CO2 steering tax is required to contain the joy of Netflix and others.Media
Disturbance dining to the aircraft is not least a media hype.When tens of thousands of (sometimes no longer so young) young people pull through the streets for the climate and demonstrate against airplanes, there is a matter of simplification on all channels.Every medium -sized flight show attracts hundreds of thousands outdoors, but that is at best enough for a message with a nice photo in the local section.
Large reports only when a plane crashes, although of course you quickly forget that the plane, measured by the route, is the safest of all means of transport.We should not let such media distortions spoil the desire to fly.The plane has made traveling faster, safer, more convenient and more affordable.

Brake tracks at Lufthansa and Swiss / / Werner Enz · The Lufthansa Group has completed the first quarter with an operating loss of adjusted € 336 million, which lacks the previous year's performance despite slightly increased traffic proceeds by a whopping € 388 million.
If the Germans even benefited from an approach to market adjustment as a result of the bankruptcy of Air Berlin, the topic of overcapacity in the European business has now come to light.On the old continent, consolidation is not far advanced compared to the American market, including because failed airlines such as Alitalia are still kept alive.In the group's internal comparison, the Swiss has made up to 4.2 % despite halving the EBIT margin.
The cost thrust for kerosene, maintenance and further falling cargo yields demanded their toll.The Swiss maintains the forecast of reaching a double-digit EBIT margin throughout the year, but this will be a hard piece of work.A double -digit medium millions must be used by holding reserve flights.
An airplane that does not fly only causes costs.This summer is again an overload of the EU air space, which will probably lead to cancellations and rebookings.Meanwhile, Lufthansa Group boss Carsten Spohr has to be careful not to get the costs out of hand.
The invoice for kerosene rose by 17 % to € 1.4 billion in the first quarter, and the increase in personnel expenditure was also disproportionately with € 7 % to € 2.2 billion if the sales increase of lean 1 % was taken.It is obvious that Austrian Airlines and Eurowings are strongly challenged in competition with the low -cost airlines Ryanair, Easy Jet and Wizz Air.If the descent continues with these daughters, correction measures will come.

Flight bans for the staff and radical climate goals / / vonnils Pfänder, Fabian Baumgartner (text), Eugen Fleckenstein (infographic) Rarely was shame as chic as it is today.
Originally shaped in Sweden, the term “flight shame” with the wave of climate protests has now also arrived in Switzerland.The credo is for flies and therefore switch to more ecological means of transport.However, the word in this country has not yet affected people's actions.
Despite demonstrations, the bookings increase, and air traffic is increasing year after year.Politicians now want to follow the words and implement the Swedish “Flygskam” in the administration.The two Stadtzürcher GLP councilors Guido Hüni and Ronny SiV made a corresponding request to the city council in April.
They require information about the number of air travel of urban employees and members of the authorities in the past four years.An answer is still pending.The reason for the advance is simple:
"Flying is the most climate -damaging way of traveling." Flights in Europe minimize for Hüni it is clear that flights from urban employees within Europe have to be reduced to a minimum.
After all, air traffic in Germany is responsible for a whopping 18 percent of the CO2 emissions."For a trip from Switzerland to other European countries, you need almost five times as much energy with the plane as if the comparable route is covered with the high -speed train." The municipal council therefore advocates a ban on flight on routes where there are ecologically sensible alternatives.
He considers the previous regulation of the city that does not provide forbidden to be toothless.The parliamentarian mentions smoking in restaurants as a model for the procedure."At the introduction there was a loud outcry, now nobody mourns smoky bars." However, the demands of the two GLP politicians are not new.
The Greens Bernhard Piller had already made a similar request in December 2013 and then, together with his party colleague Matthias Probst, called for a restriction of air travel in a postulate.Because the city council's answer at the time showed that the national workers often get on the plane for short distances.For example, a total of 676 flights were booked for urban employees and members of the authorities in 2013.
579 went over a distance of less than 1000 kilometers.219 flights had a goal that is less than 500 kilometers from Zurich.At that time, the city council justified this with the fact that a large number of these short flights were stopped when traveling to further distant destinations.
According to the Zurich city council, the city administration occupies a role model function in environmental and health issues.The employees are said to be an example for a population who decided in 2008 at the urn to anchor the goals of the 2000 watt company in the municipal regulations.In a report to the city council, two years ago, recommendations for achieving these goals were made.
Air traffic takes on a central position.Soon no more business class?The type of travel of urban employees in Zurich is now regulated in the execution provisions on personnel law.
Corresponding recommendations have been recorded since 2008."Use of the aircraft on short and medium-sized routes must be avoided," it says.However, the distance is not relevant, but the travel time: «Up to a travel time of six hours, the train should be used if possible.
Exceptions are to be justified compared to the department management.»In addition, CO2 emissions are to be compensated for for all flights by means of a climatic duct of a recognized organization.
At the responsible financial department, on request, the City Council for Prüffe, with a view to the current challenges, states whether strict rules are necessary.For Matthias Probst, the current regulations go too far.Like the GLP man Hüni, he wants to further tighten the requirements for air travel.
Depending on how the city council's response, he takes into account the current air traffic of the employees, he is considering further advances.For example, a rail obligation for destinations with a direct connection.Probst is already explaining to want to prevent business class flights from national workers in the future.
Today, business class tickets are paid for flights that last longer than ten hours.«Of course it is comfortable if you can stretch your legs.But it also takes four times more space and four times more energy, »says Probst.
However, radical demands do not want to leave a broad political alliance of SP, Greens, AL, EPP and GLP.The parties have a comfortable majority in the city center of Stadtzürcher.
The green liberals want to submit several advances in the next few weeks that aim at the heat and mobility sector, as Hüni says.«The largest savings potential is there.The city can move forward using a new incentive models. »The parties present a lot more radical suggestions in a jointly submitted advance.
With this it is said to be determined in the municipal code that Zurichers should limit the CO2 emissions to Netto zero by 2030.FDP President Severin Pflüger also believes that urban employees fly too much.The meaning of such trips is not always clear, some are completely unnecessary, he says.
The exchange with other cities is important and is a certain degree.In addition to the ecological but also the financial aspects, it should be observed.A careful handling of the taxpayers' money is important.
Pflüger, on the other hand, keeps very much of the target of 2030 zero CO2.«In addition to Paris and the 2000 watt company, we don't need new, unattainable goals.We need measures. "His
Party has recently presented a whole bundle of proposals.For example, the free -senses demand to reduce the bureaucratic hurdles in the energetic renovation of houses and the construction of solar systems.In addition, new technologies are to be used in the energy sector, for example the production of CO2-neutral methane with excess electricity, which can later be added to natural gas.
Other cities, same questioning discussion about the air travel of national workers are not only conducted in Zurich.In Bern, a mobility policy was already introduced for the city administration in 2017, which should promote railways.Last November, two green politicians also called for a restriction for short -haul flights and transparency in the number of bookings.
A motion was submitted in Basel in April this year with a number of politicians that demands that business trips on a radius of 1000 kilometers will be covered by train in the future.And in the canton of Geneva, the council transferred a advance of the green Delphine Klopfenstein Broggini.This demands that employees of the cantonal administration for business trips will only be allowed to get on the plane from over 1200 kilometers.
For Matthias Probst, there is no way around to curb air traffic.The steady increase is mainly due to the low ticket prices."Flying is just too cheap," says the local council.
There is currently a competition at the expense of the climate.«What we really need is international kerosene tax.»However, this can only be implemented in international cooperation.
First of all, it is therefore important to optimize what can be influenced directly.As the President of the Commission, he organized a training trip to Ljubljana."Flying is out of the question," says Probst.
The participants - including two city councilors - all travel to Slovenia on the night train.However, the decision was not well received by everyone.Part of the commission remains at home in protest. "What we really need is an international kerosene tax." Matthias Probstgemeinderat Gpfür The city employees and authorities were booked a total of 676 flights in 2013.

Flight writers found in the passenger jet / / Shortly after the start in Moscow, a passenger machine has to turn around on the way to the north of Russia because the radio traffic collapses.The aircraft catches fire during the emergency landing.
Markus Ackeret, Moscow Departs, when the fire stove on the landing slope at Scheremetjewo Airport in Moscow had long been extinguished, the certainty came out: A miracle is out of the emergency landing of the Russian airline Aeroflot, who was on the road from Moscow to the North Russian city of Murmansk.For once, the Russian investigation committee, the responsible law enforcement authority, initially shared the number of survivors - 33 passengers and 4 crew members.
But the remaining 41 people who had been on board the Suchoi Superjet-100 did not survive the accident, which was definitely clear in the course of Monday.Most of them may have died in the burning rear part of the wreck.The airplane accident on Sunday evening took place in front of the eyes of hundreds of waiting passengers on the largest of the four international Moscow airports, accordingly many spectacular videos quickly spread over social networks.
The rescue must also have designed somewhat clearly, in contrast to a remote, difficult to access crash location.There were different information about how quickly the fire brigade was on hand.The Russian Transport Minister Jewgeni Ditrich presented Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev on Monday afternoon that the first fire truck had arrived at the scene of the accident within one minute.
Medwedew and President Vladimir Putin had already expressed their sympathy with the victims and the bereaved on Sunday evening, and the misfortune had to be carefully examined.Dramatic situation on on board
The machine was only in the air for just under half an hour: shortly after the start, she flew a loop and returned to the airport.The pilot tried an emergency landing twice.
The rear area caught fire and was immediately surrounded by a sea of flames and a thick black column of smoke rose.The most dramatic scenes took place on board, but where the crew apparently quickly and professionally organized the evacuation via emergency slips in the front, less injured part of the aircraft.Messages circulated on the Internet about the fact that passengers of the front plane section had blocked the passengers that were pushing out of the flames because they wanted to take their hand luggage with them.
This caused quick blame and a vigorous change of words in social networks.Some commentators recalled that in such a situation nobody knows how to behave.To blame the survivors of the death of others is comfortable.
Anyone who sat at the back had no chance of getting away anyway.Eyewitnesses reported densely smoke with gas development and large heat in the interior.A flight attendant is said to have been killed in trying to save passengers.
There is still no clarity about the cause of the accident.The flight data writers were found.The investigative committee, whose boss Alexander Bastrykin visited the scene of the accident on Monday morning, called various directions of the investigations: lack of qualifications of the crew and air traffic controllers, technical defects in the aircraft, weather conditions.
Reports from the ongoing investigations and statements of passengers and the pilot indicate that the aircraft, which had completed several other flights on the same day, was hit by lightning.Thereupon the radio traffic collapsed, so that the pilots asked for a return to Moscow, which took place because of the hardly any functioning communication and full kerosins under difficult conditions.Accordingly, the fire did not already broke out in the air, but because the aircraft that was too heavy for landing put up several times, with the tank exploding.
At first there was no evidence of security deficiencies.However, there were questions to the pilots from the investigator's area.The plane was too heavy and too fast in the emergency landing.
Aeroflot, Russia's largest and most important airline, has one of the youngest fleets in Europe and a good reputation for both national and international flights.The last serious airline of the airline in 2008 affected its then subsidiary Aeroflot Nord when all 88 people died on board when a Boeing 737 crashed in Perm.Perplexed
Reporting Russian media was insufficient crisis communication for relatives.This complained about the lack of information.As often in such cases, rumors and speculations on social networks fill up the information vacuum.
The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs announced on Monday at the request of the Keystone-SDA news agency that there is currently no information about Swiss victims.The clarifications for this are underway.Further article on page

At the rescue of Alitalia, Italy runs the time of it / / Aviation with Benetton is said to support the airline that is held responsible for the collapse of the Autobahn Bridge in Genoa.
Even he waves off.Ulrike Sauer, Romin of the Endlos saga around the crash maturity Alitalia, a new leading actor has played in the foreground.Luigi di Maio (32), just started Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Industrial, drew the case of the eternal pleit candidate.
However, the party leader of the Cinque position was not closer to his goal of setting up as a rescuer of the crisis company.Last week he had to extend the deadline for submitting a takeover offer for the fourth time.Because emergency helpers who support Di Maios plan for a reglasticization of the Roman airline are rare.
Not only Lufthansa preferred to say goodbye to the political poker.A good two weeks before the European elections, the standstill brings di Maio
in an unpleasant location.The state railway group Ferrovie Dello Stato, the Ministry of Finance and the US Delta Airlines, which is interested in the integration of the North Atlantic flights into their Allianz Sky Team, agreed to start with a total of 60 percent at Alitalia.All attempts to get a partner for the remaining 40 percent on board failed.
Di Maio now runs the time.The new highlight after three almost two years ago, the then government of Alitalia granted a bridging loan of 900 million euros to maintain flight operations.Previously, the Arabic airline Etihad had failed due to the Alitalia renovation.
Three state forced administrators were appointed to find a new owner.The repayment date for the state emergency loan has been postponed several times.Until the new government has now removed the reimbursement obligation by decree.
Once again, Italy's taxpayers have to write off their money.You have already kept the flying money destruction machine alive with 8 billion euros.Alitalia has made an estimated 700 million euros in loss since the beginning of last year.
If the sales procedure is not completed as soon as possible, the commissioners only have a liquidation of the company, bankruptcy manager Daniele Discolo warned in March in front of the parliamentary committee.A handling of the insolent airline would be a embarrassment for Vice Prime Maio, the popularity of which is steadily falling in the surveys.He had promised the 11,000 Alitalia employees to maintain their jobs.
And so the drama around Alitalia is striving for a new highlight after the nearby von2008, 2014 and 2017.In its despair, Di Maio is now changing the private infrastructure group Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton industrial dynasty around Luciano Benetton.After the collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa on August 14, 2018, the government had accused the heavy family of having 43 lives on its conscience.
The Benettons are the main shareholders of the toll company Autostrade Per L ’Italia, which operates more than 3000 kilometers of the chargeable motorway network, including the section of the A10 on which the collapsed Morandi bridge is located.Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli had found the culprit twenty hours after their collapse.On Facebook, the Cinque position-man demanded the resignation of Atlantia boss Giovanni Castellucci.
He also announced the withdrawal of the operating license.A forced nationalization of the motorway operator is aimed at, di Maio rumbled at the time.The government did not do any of its threats.
From the “absolutely bad” to the murdered rescuer, she is preparing to rehabilitate the Benettons.Nine months ago the entrepreneur 'family was absolutely evil ", today di Maio would like to entrust her alitalia rescue.Atlantia is said to make the 300 million euros missing to restart.
But CEO Castellucci waved."We are currently tied to so many open fronts that we cannot think of an engagement in such a complex matter as Alitalia," he said recently at the general assembly.The surprising turn arouses memories of the crash landing that Silvio Berlusconi experienced in 2008 with his attempt to rescue.
Shortly before the elections, the then Prime Minister sabotaged the sale of Alitalia to Air France and pushed the takeover of a rope team.The thing went wrong.The Benettons, who were involved, lost their commitment of 300 million euros at the time.
The question arises eleven years later: Can the highly indebted Italy afford the luxury of an airline that makes 1.4 million euros in loss every day?Now the government can do a lot to help Castellucci from its blockade situation:
Atlantia has long wanted to invest 6 billion euros in the construction of a bypass motorway near Genoa and to widen the A14 near Bologna.However, the Minister of Transport refuses the permits.The struggle for the withdrawal of the concession for the operation of the motorways has not yet been fought.
Especially since the causes of collapse are unclear.There would be a conversation with the government.The fact that Di Maio has now extended the deadline for purchase offers until June 15 shows that the government is looking for dialogue.

Politics & Economy / / Pilate cracks the billion dollar border trial-the Pilatus aircraft works are on a high altitude.In 2018 you reached the billion-dollar sales limit.
In total, Pilatus delivered 128 aircraft last year-for the first time the business jet PC-24.As the aircraft manufacturer based in Stans announced, he increased sales of CHF 0.99 billion to CHF 1.09 billion.The order books are full.
Pilatus has open orders of CHF 2.1 billion.Mini-profit thanks to the millions of letters-Dolder Hotel AG increased sales in 2018 by 2.3 percent to CHF 60.8 million.The number of overnight stays rose by 2.9 percent to 59 267.
This washed 30.6 million francs (+3 %) into the coffers.The average room price was CHF 728.Thanks to a period of claims by the main shareholder Urs Schwarzenbach (71) of 11.8 million, the luxury house was the bottom line.
Bad grades for Swiss airports - the Swiss aviation industry only receives the predicate below average.The three country airports do not make it to the front places in a global study.The airports in particular cut off poorly.
The Basel Euro Airport lands in 77th place in the 132 examined airports.The Zurich Airport (87) ranks further back.And Geneva even came in 106th place.
In a motion, she demands that the federal government invoice the additional effort in connection with the pollutor's post -tim -off.The additional costs for the more frequent controls by the Federal Office of Transport should therefore shell out the post office.National Council defuses insurance law - the National Council has mitigated the amendment to the Insurance Contract Act.
When advising the template, he would line up, among other things, the right of insurance to change the contractual terms one -sided.This is already possible today, but the federal court sets close barriers.Law against gay hatred comes in front of the folkers-the Swiss voting will be able to state whether the anti-racism penalty is to be expanded to homo- and bisexuals.

Environmentally friendly trips makes sense / / Werner Enzder climate protection is on everyone's lips, currently gives green parties a high altitude and has many concerned citizens ask what they could do themselves.
Above all, strong emotions triggers flying, although the international aviation with generously calculated 3 percent causes much less CO2 emissions than, for example, road traffic or electricity production if coal or other fossil fuels are fired.Why does nobody talk about cruises on the high seas?When flying, two things come together:
On the one hand, the plane tickets have become increasingly cheaper, and on the other hand, the flight far up in the sky arouses fears to cause particularly great damage near the sun.From an economic waiting point of view, it is correct to include the effective costs of CO2 emissions based on the polluter pays principle.If you fly, you should be accountable.
If you do this, you can now compensate for your CO2 footprint on a voluntary basis, as the jargon says.In Switzerland, the MyClimate Foundation offers such a service.With a computing model, it shows how many tons of CO2 the air traveler should pay on a certain flight.
This is not a gray theory, because myclimate can support herself on hard numbers that are delivered by the Swiss, for example.In addition, an orientation point: a well-lined economy flight from Zurich to Tokyo causes about 5 tons of CO2 emissions per passenger;Pollution rights for this amount currently cost around CHF 150.
It is not to point out the hand that an indulgence trade in this form could encourage travelers to fly even more.With all the enthusiasm for the individual compensation of CO2 emissions, should not be forgotten that there is often an ecologically better alternative to the flight, such as a train or bus ride.The last place is not in the last place.
Summer holidays do not necessarily have to play on distant gestures.Incidentally, myclimate and other conservationists are also responsible: With concrete projects, you have to provide evidence that the money received was really CO2 emissions out of the world.
A weighing of the goods cannot be about choking up the need for mobility, flying or introducing a kind of contingentation.But there can be a price tag for CO2 emissions.It not only offers an incentive to travel more environmentally conscious.

If a long flight flies with less conscience / / Werner Enzwer, this usually not only makes you happy, but with a growing concern for global warming.A feeling of guilt gnaw at some earthly citizens, and young people demand environmentally friendly behavior in public rallies with a lot of reprint.
It is hardly disputed that global warming is caused by people caused by humans caused by humans.In the meantime, price comparisons are not only made on the Internet for flights, but a CO2 computer is trying to find out how expensive overexploitation is to be done on nature.Brought to the shortest denominator: Anyone who books a long-haul flight over 10,000 km back and forth in the economy class pays about CHF 150 for their CO2 footprint (roughly valued 5 t).
In the business class, the price of how it can be calculated at the Myclimate Foundation is almost twice as high, and the first-time first customer that takes even more space pays triple.Swiss wants to do it easier to do in this constellation, unlike some competitors, does not simply put the head into the sand, because the topic of environmental pollution is increasingly concerned with customers and governments.
Lufthansa employees have been compensated for for some time at the Myclimate Foundation.This is just a secondary aspect, because the topic of climate protection must arrive especially when it comes to passengers and are anchored there.In any case, Lufthansa and the Swiss have been supplying company-specific data for more than “standardized” 43,000 flights for years to reflect their traffic flows on all short and long distances.
The cooperation of the Swiss with Myclimate, a spin-off from ETH students with future visions, goes back to 2007.In the near future, the spokesman for Myclimate, the Swiss will make it much easier to do the Obolus for CO2 emissions directly.It is about the fact that this option can be clicked earlier than before, similar to the input for a seat reservation or for additional luggage.
CO2 pollution rights are currently still booked too well over 90 % directly via the Myclimate platform.Incidentally, the current boom has to be relativized: In Switzerland, less than 1 % of flights or air traffic would be compensated for by CO2 compensation, says Myclimate.
The Swiss confirms that the Lufthansa Group is preparing the integration of CO2 compensation into the booking process on its new platform.The innovation with the MyClimate module is to be introduced this year.A wealth of input data like
Exactly the CO2 emissions of a certain flight are recorded?The Swiss explains that the complete kerosene consumption from Gate to Gate is determined, whereby factors such as headwind, queue would be included at an airport or detours due to the overload.Of course, you and her customers benefit that new aircraft consuming, new aircraft consumes with the Airbus A220 on the short and medium distance as well as with the Boeing-777 on the long distances.
What a Swiss cannot influence, but additionally stresses the environment, are the queues due to the overload of the EU air space.This summer will ensure red heads again with certainty.As far as the long -distance distance is concerned, Myclimate sees an important lever in the “voluntary cause fee”, since there is currently no sensible alternative and a flight ban does not solve any problems.
Myclimate thus uses a Swiss data set that is updated at certain intervals to map effective flight behavior.However, the foundation has developed its own algorithm, which, among other things, weights the different booking classes.Finally, the CO2 emission value, which is individually calculated for each passenger, is also doubled.
In an approximation that is scientifically controversial, the environmental pollution is taken into account by further emissions such as nitrogen oxides, Russia or water vapor in higher flight areas.Even the condensed strips that are clearly visible on a beautiful summer evening are said to have an impact on the formation of cirrus clouds and thus the world climate.Myclimate uses this factor 2 only for kerosine burning, but not for the stairs upstream such as the cleverly kerosene or the (also the environment)
Transport of kerosene to an airport.Incidentally, the price for 1 t CO2 emission is currently fixed at CHF 28, with other causers also called to make their contribution.Myclimate has many other partners in Switzerland, for example the large distributors Migros and Coop.
Keep accounting to make myclimate the ideas
from when more and more Swiss are now compensating for their CO2 footprint?The spokesman for the foundation currently sees no problem at all, because there is clearly no funds to implement around 50 proof of pregnancy.Thanks to the compensation of 832750 T CO2 emissions, the foundation only flowed a little more than CHF 12 million in 2017, but the trend is sharp.
The scalability of climate protection projects is great.Specifically, reforestation programs, GPS systems in Africa or efficient stoves are financed in developing countries.Cooking over open fire is particularly harmful to the environment, but is still everyday life for around 3 billion people.
Myclimate says that UN quality standards for certification of environmental protection projects would be observed and controls take place on site.It is important to realize a CO2 emission reduction within about two or three years, whereupon certificates would then expire.This closes the circle and nature is good.

Dispute to re -admission the Boeing 737 Max / / Andreas Spaethzwei crash, the last one at Ethiopian Airlines in March, keep Boeing's biggest sales hit, the 737 Max, worldwide on the ground.This affects around 370 aircraft already delivered to airlines plus the now over 100 machines, which are stored on various Boeing workshops in the USA with continued production.
The struggle for the consequences from the crashes, the question of guilt and the procedure for the re-admission of the machines does not seem to be over. "Boeing has made mistakes and they have to be turned off," said Gary Kelly, the head of the largest Max operator, SouthwestAirlines, on Wednesday in Denver.It is hoped to put the currently 31 opposite Max back into operation at Southwest in the upcoming summer."Nobody is happy with the situation, our entire growth strategy is based on Max," said Kelly.
Criticism exposed to the U.S. Air Travel Authority FAA is also increasingly seeing itself due to the approval process for the 737 max.The incumbent head of the authorities Daniel Elwell had to face a hearing of the traffic committee before the US Congress on Wednesday in Washington.Many MPs were frustrated that neither Boeing nor FAA had previously provided requested documents or requested explanations.
The authority has left monitoring tasks that are actually in its own responsibility, the manufacturer Boeing.The FAA boss Elwell defended the procedure in which Boeing inspected employees of their own planes as a "good system".At the same time, Elwell criticized Boeing.
«The automatic trim system MCAS would have had to be better explained by pilots all over the world.“That hadn't happened before the crashes.Both Boeing and the FAA had even refused to provide information about the system after the first Max crash in Indonesia in Indonesia to provide the investigators there.
Elwell also criticized the long period of thirteen months that Boeing had used to give that a warning system in the MAX only worked in combination with another system to be acquired at an additional charge.Most airlines have not installed this.The FAA boss announced no schedule for the re-approval of the max.
He would only release the planes for traffic again if this recommends a consultant committee from different institutions.The relatives of this body, among them representatives of NASA and the US air weapon, were not involved in the original approval.However, it is unclear whether the FAA - contrary to earlier assertions - will only be given re -registration on its own.
So far, it was planned that the US authority decided in accordance with eight other international aviation authorities, including the European EASA, about re-registration.According to media reports, the FAA is aiming to accept software updates for Max in June or July, while the international group wants to advise on these updates until the end of July.A dispute is also the question of whether simulator training should be prescribed for pilots for the first time after the update, which Boeing has always rejected and avoided.
Supposedly, the FAA still sees no need for this, while the Canadian authority considers it imperative.At the Congress Hearing on Wednesday, Boeing's defense strategy was also recognizable, with which the aircraft manufacturer will probably argue in many upcoming procedures before the dishes: the reference to alleged pilot errors in the max.An expert opinion ordered by Boeing investors subordinates the accident pilot partly ruthless and negligent behavior and sees pilot errors as the main cause of accidents.

Municipalities are leaning plans for Dübendorf airfield / / Aviation with the federal plans for the airfield, the local communities are dissatisfied.
The federal government has received “Dicke Post” from the municipalities of Dübendorf, Volketswil and Wangen-Brüttisellen since February.It is about the plans he has for Dübendorf airfield.The three location communities announced yesterday that they "clearly reject" the corresponding property sheet in the infrastructure of the aviation (SIL).
The population also has already received thousands of statements from the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZL).In February, the Bazl sent its plans for the use of the future civilian airfield.The three municipalities now criticize that "important and above all security-relevant topics such as coordinating the arrival and departure processes with Kloten Airport are not well documented".
In addition, there has been no consideration of all interests.The federal government only pursues the interests of Dübendorf AG airfield (FDAG).It will be the operator of the civilian airfield.
This includes, for example, the slope extension, which could result in larger and louder aircraft.Specifically, the municipalities defend themselves that the business jets outsourced by Zurich-Kloten Airport and sports and leisure flying are moved to Dübendorf.The latter are particularly disturbing.
In addition, long -term operating times are planned, and there is also exceptions that result in further expansion of the operating times.Fewer flights requested the location communities require a restriction of annual flight movements to a maximum of 20,000 and concentrated flight times to the working days between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. with a lunch break between 12 and 1.30 p.m.
Leisure and sports-sowing business flights should not take place, and no private heliport should also be created on the northern area.A mobility concept with a minimum of parking spaces and various water protection and revitalization measures are also required.With its plans, which would lead to more flight movements, the federal government contradicts their own goals for climate protection, it is finally said.

Women's power in the Federal Council / / Since the beginning of the year, the two new Federal Councilors have been in office.In addition, two previous people have changed the department.
I think that in the Federal Council there is a spirit of optimism.Viola Amherd is spectacular.
A woman in the VBS is a premiere.She immediately took over a steep arms program.The army leadership needs new fighter jets, modern ground air defense as well as a competitive lighter armament for the ground troops.
CHF 15 billion will be budgeted for the next few years.Viola Amherd has hired external consultants.
You should check needs and costs.She does everything differently than the predecessor has prepared.Oh yes, Guy Parmelin, he is almost forgotten.
Amherd makes a down -to -earth impression.«It would be a shame if I hadn't ended up in the VBS.I am satisfied, »I read.
I am thinking .No, I never heard that in my long parliamentary period.Karin Keller-Sutter came to the Bundeshaus as St. Gallen government councilor with a call to be a tough legal one.
Type 08/15 So.It was all the more surprising how well the St. Gallen Ständeratduo Keller-Sutter / Rechsteiner worked together.My experience has been confirmed.
A correct and no wiping was-free is compromising.At the framework agreement, Keller-Sutter does the right thing, she defends wage protection with the unions.It is a "nice left" for the SVP CHF ideologist.
Nonsense.Our system is based on the compromise.Sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right.
Meeting point.Left amazement and will be annoyed if the basement-sutter will also take the hard bourgeois tour.Simonetta Sommaruga is a new transport minister.
So it fits great that the Alpine protection initiative adopted by the people in 1994 celebrates its 25th anniversary.An ideal political stage for your debut.Pfeffer brought this initiative into transport policy.
On the north-south transit route Basel-Chiasso and over the Simplon the goods are to be shifted from the road to rail.The number of trucks decreased from 1.4 million to 941,000 in 2018.The demand for the Alpine protection initiative has of course not yet been carried out.
The initiators have negotiated a compromise with the federal government.A maximum of 650,000 trucks may run.It doesn't work without any streets.
This compromise must now be implemented.There has been too little in recent years.Sommaruga will present a template with measures.
Yes, the three federal councilors mark women's power.Helmut Hubacher early National Councilor SP Basel-Stadtviola

"Bern Airport has no future without regular traffic" / / Max Unzricht the Aviatik expert and former Skywork Communicator criticizes the planned capital increase of the canton at Bern Airport.
Rather, the state should support air traffic.Interview: Julian Witschinach The cantonal government wants to save Bern AG's Grounding Grounding with tax millions.Mr. Ungricht, why do you find that wrong?
Max Ungricht: The state should not ventilate a half -dead.The airport has no future without line traffic.Therefore, the canton should instead support air traffic, as it does for all other public transport companies.
However, the planned contribution to the cost of air traffic control is correct.Because air traffic control Skyguide is a monopoly, which is so politically wanted.As a result, politics must help to correct the consequences of the monopoly, the overpriced.
However, the government council has excluded subsidies to individual flight connections.This is a mistake .The airport needs many passengers to finance the large cost blocks security and air traffic control.
This is only possible with regular line traffic.Skywork delivered passenger fees in the high single -digit million range to Bern Airport alone.There were also landing taxes and income from the handling of the commercial aircraft.
In addition, our passengers paid parking fees, catered for at the airport and shopped at the kiosk.Could Skywork have survived with cheaper, subsidized infrastructure costs at Bern Airport?At least a lot of pressure would have been taken away.
Let's not forget, Bern Airport was the most expensive in the SkyWork route network alongside London.And every second landing took place here.The airport contributed to the demise of Skywork with its prize policy.
Despite our warnings that prices are too high, the board of directors has even promised a dividend.That is absurd .You have been working in Belpmoos for many years.
What would it mean for you if Bern Airport no longer existed?For me, the airport is part of the Bernese DNA.Not everyone can see that because we like to make Berners smaller than we are.
A federal capital without airport and without attractive line traffic is the descent to provinciality.What fascinates her about the Belpmoos?Since I am connected with flying professionally and privately, this place is my second home.
Here I can exchange ideas every day with committed airport employees and other people from the aviatic scene - so it is not just a place of work, but also of joy.And as a small shareholder I tick like most others: Our contribution is a commitment to the airport, we do not expect a financial return.
How should the airport be saved in Belpmoos?It has been shown that airlines based in Bern are simply not able to survive.The airport should position itself in terms of price and with a total range of services in such a way that it pays off for airlines to be born in Bern.
But under the current premises, there will be no longer a separate airline in Bern in the foreseeable future.And it cannot be that flights from Bern as with Skywork have been financed by private individuals for years, in knowledge of never getting a return.What should the canton and the airport do so that there are line traffic again from Bern-Belp?
There are different solutions.My suggestion is to establish a virtual airline, i.e. a pure marketing and sales organization.This instructs an airline to operate certain routes.
The advantage: much smaller capital deployment, no operational risks and a crystal -clear cost situation.In addition, such an organization is closer to customers than it is foreign providers.A virtual airline can be built up and operated by a small team of innovative industry experts.
The project could be financed as part of the cantonal location promotion.And your other solutions?The then SkyWork Financier Daniel Borer wanted to take over the airport and offer an overall product from a single source.
But that was prevented.Altenrhein Airport, on the other hand, has done exactly this bundling.And he doesn't live with it.
Without the unconditional will of all stakeholders, Bern is not possible.Politics, tourism, are needed.And it also needs the inclusion of the passengers.
The air travelers can switch to Zurich, Geneva or Basel.Where is our Bernese self -confidence?An airport is an important location factor.
If you fly little, you can take the longer way to other airports.But there are countless people from our region who are traveling weekly, such as employees of the local SMEs.For them it is quality of life not to be at home only after midnight.
But there is no strategy and, above all, the commitment to line traffic as the most important service provider at Bern Airport.Do you criticize the board of directors?Naturally .
I do not know which member of the board of directors is of which opinion.But the president is his face.Not a single strategic goal was achieved under Beat Brechbühl.
The current fiasco is homemade.Under today's management, I don't believe in a turnaround.However, the Board of Directors presented a new strategy and has been able to move the cantonal government to the airport for a commitment.
The new strategy leaves no room for hope.Statements on the future such as “Mobility Center” or “Swiss Digital Traffic Hub” are content -free marketing phrases.The strategy does not make a statement about the existential core point, the line flights.
Except for the recurring wishful thinking of a hub connection.Those responsible for the airport say that they are connected to partners for new line flights.Yes, it will be so.
Only the “Bern Airport” brand is no longer the best.I want to tell you an incredible story: Last autumn, a person living in the Bernese Oberland grew up a former skywork employee to found a new airline.
I had an insight into the absurd business model.When the business plan was introduced to me-already with the statement that Embraer was under discussion with Embraer because of two 100-placed aircraft-the initiators did not even have figures on the previous passenger volume in Bern.However, the airport granted the team free of charge and clung to this absurd straw for five months.
Why do I tell?Where, please, was the expertise on the board of directors?The result: a lot of lost time in crisis management and playwill playful across Europe.
With Urs Ryf, the airport is now receiving a new boss.I hope he will do a good job.But Urs Ryf has already spoken of Embraer-190 aircraft with around 110 seats in Bern, the Destination Munich and the importance of a hub connection.
This is nonsense, such a large plane cannot be filled here.Munich had the most passengers during Skywork.But here the airport broke a ruinous price war from the fence by bringing the BMI airline to Bern.
The number of passengers flying from Bern via a hub has always been very small.With the fourth expansion stage, the airport plans to strengthen line and charter traffic and separate from private and sports aviation.Does that bring anything?
It is certainly right for the airport to diversify and strengthen business jets business.However, a handful of passengers are getting out of business aircraft.In addition, the traffic volume of the business jets cannot be planned.
This means that you get an expensive infrastructure without knowing whether it is also used.If there is no longer line traffic in Belpmoos, the project is superfluous.In this newspaper, those responsible for Bern Airport will soon be given the opportunity to react to the criticism of Max Ungricht.

Ex-skywork man reads government councilor and airport chiefs the Levites / / Bern-Belp Airport "The state should not ventilate a half-dead": Aviatic expert Max Ungricht criticizes the government council and airport management.
Julian Witschigegen The planned tax money in the millions for Bern Airport have already vehemently announced the Greens and the VCS.Now there is also criticism from the aviation industry: Aviatic expert Max Ungricht, who has also worked for Skywork for years, finds the subsidies planned by the government council wrong.
Because without line traffic, the airport has no future, says Ungricht in an interview with this newspaper.But under the current premises there will be no longer a separate airline in Belpmoos in the foreseeable future.Instead, the canton should support air traffic, as it does with all other public transport companies.
The government council has sent a new law into the consultation with which the canton should be able to permanently support the airport financially.If the law comes through, the government is considering that the canton will take part in a capital increase of the airport with just under CHF 6 million.This would keep 30 percent of the shares on the company.
The canton should continue to participate in infrastructure projects and co -finance air traffic control.Max Ungricht has not only contributed to the costs for air traffic control, but also the comparatively high taxis and fees of the airport to the downfall of the Berner Airline Skywork.The former airline communicator does not save with criticism of those responsible for the airport.

The rail connection of the euro airport strengthens public transport / / around eight million passengers every year from or to euro airport.In addition, there are over 6000 employees who head for their workplace at the airport every day.
Most of them come and go by car, by bus or taxi.You have no other choice, because the airport is still only accessible on the street;Or expressed in the language of transport policy: The modal split in the traffic concept of the airport achievement is 100 percent car -heavy.
With a rail connection, at least a third of the traffic volume could be brought from the street.That would be half a million car trips a few a year, which would make sense from an ecological point of view due to the lower CO2 emissions.Why didn't you do that long ago?
One first reason is certainly the complexity of a cross -border rail project.As is well known, the political mills grind slowly, especially when it comes to financing.In the meantime, however, there is a concrete project that is based on the existing line network between Mulhouse and Basel and is supposed to connect the euro airport to the rail network with a “branch” at ST-Louis.
After the project was considered without a chance due to lack of interest in French politics, after the change of opinion in the Ministry of Transport, planning is now moving forward.Another reason for the reluctance of the rail connection of the airport can be seen on the Swiss side.Here it is feared that such a development would make the airport more attractive and lead to more flight movements and noise.
I was able to understand this reasoning when-years ago-the idea of a direct connection of intercity trains from all over Switzerland was in the room.From Bern and Zurich directly and conveniently to Basel in the holiday pilot - that would have actually had a noticeable impact on the flight offer.The project now is about something completely different, namely the strengthening of the S-Bahn network in the Trinational region of Basel.
New diameter lines between Basel and Strasbourg, Liestal and Mulhouse as well as running and ST-Louis are planned, each with a stop at the euro airport.This is to be included in a “loop” entirely in the French area.If you come by train from Zurich or Bern, you have to change in Basel as before to get to the airport.
The “rail connection” is therefore not an airport project, but a project of public transport between France and Switzerland.There are more and better connections between the train stations of the affected routes.This not only relieves the airport road, but the entire road network in the border region.
The many commuters who are stuck in traffic every day today benefit from this strengthening of public transport.Of course, it cannot be pointed out that when the airport is being binded to the regional S-Bahn network, faster and more reliable connections are created, which in turn are beneficial to the attractiveness of the airport.However, the rail connection does not want to bring passengers to the airport anymore, but rather offer an alternative and attractive journey and thus relieve the streets.
The current political discussion is about weighing up the strengthening of public transport and a moderate increase in flight movements.It would be a missed chance if this consideration was at the expense of a strong S-Bahn network in the Dreiland from the outset.Balz Stückelbergerlandrat FDP, Arlesheimmit

"Without cantonal funds, a fallow wasteland would arise" / / / Airport Bern The government council wants to save the airport and permanently support them with tax money.
Left parties, on the other hand, have announced resistance.Beat Brechbühl, Board of Directors of Airport Bern AG, and Urs Ryf, designated managing director, take a position on the location of the company, their future plans for the Belpmoos and the difficult situation with the city of Bern.Interview: Julian Witschiundquentin Schlapbachher Brechbühl, the hub in Zurich and the low -cost airlines in Basel are so close, does Bern even need an airport?
Beat Brechbühl: We are convinced of it.For several reasons: First, Bern Airport is of economic importance with a added value of CHF 180 million per year and 500 jobs.
This also includes the bases of Rega and Swisstransplant who save lives.Second, he is of political importance with the federal air transport services, especially for visiting diplomacy.Third, we have a tourist importance.
And finally an emotional importance for Bern as the airport in the capital.The government council has promised them financial aid.The Greens, on the other hand, have announced resistance.
What happens if the subsidies don't come?Beat Brechbühl: First a fallow wasteland would be created here.The industry and the jobs would be gone.
If neither the state nor private investors are involved, we can no longer finance air traffic control and the necessary replacement investments.What would happen after bankruptcy at Bern AG Airport is no longer in our hands.It would be conceivable that the active people would be acquired from the bankruptcy mass and that only business aviation would continue - with much lower cost block.
Since SkyWork Grounding, there has been no line air traffic.Does today's infrastructure, such as air traffic control or terminal, still need?Beat Brechbühl: This is the fundamental question:
Do we want a public airport for the population or a private for private and business flying?A purely private airport is operated by private owners according to purely commercial principles - it only does what pays off.That would mean: no air traffic control, no tourist flights and no more federal flying.
A public airport is public infrastructure and also needs public money.The public benefits from the added value and jobs, so it also has to contribute to the costs.Of the CHF 180 million
The airport benefits only a fraction - in 2018 it was just CHF 8 million in sales.However, we are fully applying the costs - it just doesn't work.How long can the airport survive without cantonal money?
Beat Brechbühl: We reduced the costs and reduced 31 out of 96 full -time positions so that we can survive.But we have no investment potential for the future.And in the acquisition of new airlines we now have to have movements.
We can see ourselves if we get the signals that we go towards the public airport.Since Skywork's grounding last August, new airlines have not managed to attract.Mr. Ryf, how do you want to change this as the new airport director?
Urs Ryf: First I would like to emphasize that we also have five charter flight destinations on offer this summer.The demand for a larger charter offer and also after all year round from Bern-Belp has existed, and they still exist.
Developing this potential irritated me to change Payerne Airport here.As a Bernese, I am also emotionally associated with this airport.
My absolute priority is to acquire new charter and line traffic.Which line flight destinations do you want to rebuild?Urs Ryf: My goal is to rebuild the lines that were well asked for recently.
This with the right plane, i.e. first with a machine with around 50 places.We will also try to bring passengers from abroad to Bern.I see, for example, that we could bring Asian European travelers from the Munich Hub to Bern and the Oberland.
That would make more sense than losing time on the clogged A1 from Zurich.Can you report specific progress in negotiations with airlines and tour operators?Urs Ryf: We have very intensive negotiations on different levels, with airlines, tour operators and airports, but we have no result.
The business is fundamentally changing.In what way ?Urs Ryf:
In the charter business, travel agencies want to launch a large program for 2020, but aircraft is missing, especially in summer.The situation has intensified with the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max fleet.My favorite for Bern is an Embraer 190 with around 110 seats.
Hot water destinations such as Egypt could also be flown in in winter.In line traffic, we have the problem that the regional airlines no longer take any risks, but would like to have ordered and paid the offer from the airport or the location.But we can't do that alone.
Then the state should support airlines financially directly so that they fly from Bern?Beat Brechbühl: He could, but the government and most parties reject it.And from a perspective policy point of view, I can understand that not to prefer individual companies directly.
The support of the airport, on the other hand, means receiving a public platform for aviatics and an investment in the transport infrastructure.And with all respect, you also have to consider the proportionality: In the lecture, the government writes about a minority stake.
That would make up around CHF 8 million today.And recently I heard that the expansion of a roundabout should cost around 25 million ... Apparently, state subsidies for building and marketing flight connections are common elsewhere.
Beat Brechbühl: Right.And let's not forget, many other airports are in whole or to a large extent in possession of the public sector: Geneva, Basel, Lugano and Sitten or Payerne.We don't want to go that far in Bern.
The economy has always helped and continues to help finance the airport.But it also needs a commitment and a public commitment if you continue to want public airport.A public airport only makes sense with line traffic.
Mr. Ryf, do you really think that a larger line network will be created from Bern again?Urs Ryf: Bern Airport has potential in the medium and long term, which has shown the past.Passenger numbers in Zurich, Geneva or Basel rise, and people's mobility needs also grow in the Bern area.
There is simply no alternative to the aircraft for medium and distant destinations.We are currently examining different strategic options.One topic is also to found a virtual airline, i.e. to rent aircraft and crews for certain lines.
We also work on such a project or support such efforts.But investors are also needed for this.What do you say about the accusation that the airport is complicit in Skywork Grounding because it asked too high tariffs?
Beat Brechbühl: This is absolutely wrong.We massively supported Skywork.Without the airport, the airline would have been reinforced at least twice in advance.
In 2014 I myself formed a consortium from the airport area and invested money when Mr. Borer wanted to get out.We have lost all of that.And apart from that: The cost share of the airport and flight safety fees for an airline is just eight percent of the total costs.
I don't say more about it.In contrast to the cantonal government, the municipal council of the city of Bern has not yet known itself too clearly to the airport.Mr. Brechbühl, are you disappointed by the local council?
Beat Brechbühl: The municipal council must now confess color.The city of Bern is the landowner of the airport.And if she thinks economically, she doesn't care that an industrial wasteland could arise here.
We stretched out the city and broke out our future plans, especially in real estate development.And yes, because the liquidity is currently tight, we have applied for a reduction in the building rights interest rate of CHF 225,000 today - one can expect to help in need.How would you describe the relationship with the city of Bern?
Beat Brechbühl: The city of Bern and the airport always had a difficult relationship.For a long time it was said by the city that line and charter flights were good, but the small flying is bad.Now the charter and line are apparently bad.
Certain circles in the city of Bern would like to have only the national transport services and the Rega, that is, “good” aircraft, that save lives or transported government presidents through the world.But that alone does not exist, it is not feasible economically.Some city councilors want to abolish the airport completely.
Beat Brechbühl: This is the proposal of the Greens.At least they are honest.But whoever claims that after a closure of the Bern Airport would only be one less flight lesson in this world, is either naive or populist.
What is certain, on the other hand, the 500 jobs will be eliminated if there is no airport.These are mainly jobs on the ground, not in the air.If you want to accept this, please say that openly.
However, one should not trust that the economy or a patron would then step in again.With the cantonal millions, however, it is already foreseeable that their opponents will compete with climate protection arguments in any voting struggle.Do you think you will penetrate with your economic arguments?
Beat Brechbühl: Yes, we are convinced of that and we are committed to that.Flying is part of our social development and will always remain.The contribution of flying to the global CO2 emissions is just 2.5 percent.
For comparison: that of computer science is 3 to 5 percent today - and the trend is rising.That is why nobody comes up with the idea of abolishing the whole computer science.We have to make sure that all industries - including aviatics - become more energy -efficient.
These are global and national questions, but certainly not regional.Believe in Bern Airport: Managing Director Urs Ryf and Board of Directors Beat Brechbühl in front of the airport building.Photo: Raphael Moser «The municipal council now has to show color.

Brechbühl did not promise rosy forecasts for the current year.«The hole will be even bigger in 2019.»In the long term, however, one is confident that the airport has a perspective.
Brechbühl particularly emphasized the opportunities of digital mobility.«We would like to build a mobility center here and create companies, organizations and jobs.»Primarily, a mantle use on the ground around the public slopes is planned.
«We are looking for users and investors for this.»Government Councilor Christoph Ammann (SP) was also present at the General Assembly.In his speech, he confirmed the importance of the airport for the canton of Bern.

Greta instead of Crete: Airport loses passengers / / air travel
In May, 30,000 people flew from and from Kloten than in the previous year.The number of local passengers declined in April.It is controversial whether this is a consequence of the climate movement.
Ruedi Baumannseit of the 2009 financial crisis has increased the number of passengers who fly over Zurich Airport without exception.In March the trend with a nuller was tipped for the first time.
In April and also in May, both the number of local passengers and the sum of the flight movements dropped.Is this turnaround a "statistical anomaly", as the airport communicated in April?Or is it already a flight shame and a real concern for the climate that the Swiss deal?
To the time process: The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg made world prominence at WEF in Davos legs in January, and the “Climate Youth” began to go on strike in Switzerland.And in May, the new Zurich cantonal council decided to the "climate emergency". Strong growth 2018en Saxon Slogan "Greta instead of Crete" has shaped a journalist from CH Media.Will the environmentally conscious Swiss family go hiking to Graubünden next summer, or is she unimpressed to Crete into the bathing holidays?
Last December, when nobody knew outside of Sweden Greta, Stephan Widig, CEO of Airport Zurich AG, proudly reported: «The demand for international mobility is constantly increasing, the population is growing, and the world is becoming more and more international.»The over 31 million passengers, who flown in 2018 via Zurich, gave rise 5.8 percent more than in the previous year.The statistical bumper in March gradually becomes a trend.
In the current traffic statistics, the airport reports a decline in local passengers in May by 1.5 percent or almost 30,000 passengers compared to the previous year.However, the number of transfer passengers has increased with 5.2 percent further.Most of them are foreigners who take little care of the local climate debate.
That is why the airport also comes to a delicate plus of 0.3 percent in May.However, the number of flight movements as well as the seat utilization ( - 1.2 percent) fell for the second time.According to the airport spokeswoman Raffaela Stelzer, it is "too early to make a statement about whether the decline in the number of local passengers in April and May has something to do with the discussion about global warming".
Rather, the airport speaks of “consolidation” according to the high growth rates of previous years.The larger aircraft had their full effect in 2018 in terms of passenger numbers.In addition, the airport refers to the holidays: this year Pentecost was in June, last year in May.
Further arguments from Kloten, which is why the climate youth cannot write the decline in climate -damaging flying - yet - on its banners: the Spanish vueling has reduced its range of route, and the market for leasing aircraft has dried out quite a bit due to the problems with the B737 - 800max "».Airlines that wanted to use additional aircraft are not possible to obtain them.Despite the climate debate, Zurich Airport is currently expecting around 3 percent for the whole year 2019.
Liliane Rotzetter from Railtour / Frantour says: «We have increased bookings for night trains.»For the next few weeks there are still no problem for Vienna and free capacities for Berlin during the week.
"Due to the great demand, bookings for night trains towards Hamburg or the popular Glacier Express have become difficult in summer." The demand for "railway -related" destinations such as Paris, Lyon, Milan or Salzburg is also good and depending on the destination inone to double-digit percentage range.The Rail Tour spokeswoman: «We are also increasingly receiving individual inquiries for train rides into actual flight destinations such as Moscow, London or Lisbon.“Realistically, however, one has to say that these travel destinations on Railtour are still much more often booked by flight.
The sober numbers speak for the aircraft for further distant destinations.According to London, the journey by train takes around eight hours, for example, instead of four by air (including airport procedure) and costs back from CHF 200 instead of CHF 140 for a cheap flight.So twice the time and a third more expensive.
The booking stand in summer is more than the previous year.For the next winter, however, you lie above it.
According to spokeswoman Bianca Schmidt, Tui Suisse notices "no changes in the booking figures".
Most customers would continue to travel to warm destinations with the plane.Favorite destinations: Mallorca, the southern Turkey and Crete.However, TUI registers an increased demand for compensation options.
The Myclimate Foundation in Zurich offers one way to compensate for the CO2 emissions of flight but also car or ship trips.The funds are used in biogas plants in India or for the reforestation of forest in Nicaragua.For a flight to Ireland, for example, 15 francs are due.
Skeptics call this a "modern indulgence trade" .Myclimate spokesman Kai Landwehr reports "literally exploding compensation payments".In 2018, CO2 compensations had increased by 70 percent, in the first quarter of 2019 by 200 percent.In May and April, the donations even increased five times compared to the previous year.

The end of responsibility is approaching / / Jan Söffner «Imagine an aircraft manufacturer who tells you:‹ Well, I don't know why this aircraft that I built is safe - actually I don't even know how it flies at all.
But I assure them that nothing can happen. '“When Nick Bostrom wanted to illustrate the ethical problems of artificial intelligence in 2011 with these words, they were still mind game.Only seven years later, the case is no longer hypothetical, and it soon affects almost all planes.
The currently most modern flight control system is the ACAS X (Airborne Collision Avoidance System X).Among other things, it is an answer to the fatal collision of Überlingen, in which the older system TCAS (Traffic Alert and avoidance system), manually programmed to be conceivable, failed.ACAS X would have avoided the collision because it uses a kind of self -learning software:
It no longer follows an endless list of human -developed rules, but has developed its rules itself.In short: Even the developers of this software do not know why nothing can happen.What can be won with such software becomes particularly clear when you think of another prominent area of use of self -learning software.
Self -traveling cars avoid countless accidents - thanks to never -fitting, never horny, never tired computers who never look at the smartphone because they are already online anyway.What is the "best" solution?Incidentally, as in air traffic control - a completely different problem is solved: that of responsibility.
Accidents that still happen will really only be accidents, no criminal offenses.There will be no people who run drunk a child and will no longer be happy about their lives - and no parents who make their hell on earth even more hot: what happens on the street will no longer be personal, but beyondGood and evil .However, the ethics is not quite off the table yet.
On the contrary .The more comprehensive such control technology is used, the more situations will occur in which two evils have to be decided - a dead pedestrian and a paraplegic driver, for example.In this way, a very well -known ethical dilemma reality, namely the so -called soft operator problem, which the criminal law theorist Karl Engisch developed as early as 1930.
The thought experiment goes like this: Imagine a leading railway car races towards five people, which he would easily kill if you did not change the lever on a soft one.Then he races towards just one person.
So if you press the lever, you will kill this one person - but also save five people.According to similar principles, self -learning software minimizes the damage and finds the “best” solution.The nick Bostrom, cited at the beginning, advocates programming and controlling artificial intelligence according to ethical principles.
He is aware that moral values and principles change and can vary from society to society.But what does we have any other, he asks to tackle this problem and to solve it software law, for example through criteria that allow certain relativism.Remarkably clear and simple, the problem formulated the German sociologist Max Weber in his lecture “Politics as a profession” almost exactly a hundred years ago by distinguishing two forms of responsibility for political space: intellectual ethics and ethics of responsibility.
Only the former is based on moral principles (how software would need it freely to Bostrom);However, as such, this ethics is irresponsible because it does not determine its good or right not to the consequences, but to the principles and maxims of action.On the other hand, responsibility ethics are not the executing organs of principles for Weber.
They do not hang on the threads of an abstract virtue, but have to stand up for the consequences of what they do to others: No matter what principles they have followed.The consequences of the Tunswas Responsibility means concretely and in which respect the answers can be an ethical imperative, nobody got better than the Russian-French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas.His focus was on the face of the other person who comes with the claim to be accepted as a man.
However, since everyone is the center and origin of a world for themselves, this claim is not an easy one, but an infinite and absolute one that cannot be put into perspective: whoever answers another person and focuses on such an answer-This is responsible for an entire world.Both for Weber and Lévinas, the actual ethical problem is therefore not one of the principles, but one of responsibility - and responsibility is so important precisely because it applies even if principles do not help or become paradoxical.
Specifically: The switch -up problem cited above is not a dilemma for a person of responsibility.For him, the question does not arise whether it is more correct to passively kill five people or actively.The point is only:
He knows that he must be able to see the bereaved in the face.This is exactly where artificial intelligence must fail.A self -learning program set up according to Bostrom's hopes would work roughly as one of its laws to the smallest paragraph of a paragraph self -generating constitutional presentation - without legislative control by a parliament and without a human judge.
Artificial intelligence needs rules, but cannot be responsible, it obeys principles and maxims, but does not have to stand up for any consequences: in this extreme form, Weber could hardly have thought of a mind ethic at its time.Such a late victory of the ethics of spirit about the ethics of responsibility can be perceived as a relief, because responsibility is an enormous burden.
The world always has surprises and comes with consequences that you did not think of, so that you always have to get involved with "diabolical powers" as a female ethic.Some of these make it necessary to counter them in a similarly diabolical and unethical way, because everything else would be effective and therefore irresponsible.If self -learning software can at least simulate responsibility ethics, then it should not be tied to ethical principles, but should be able to be able to be free - which could have completely unpredictable consequences.
Seen in this way, it also becomes clear what you lose if you deal with personal guilt and personal anger through self -driving cars in traffic.And so it also shows what the old philosophical dream of being able to describe and controlled the world through ethical principles was actually: it was the dream of overcoming responsibility, the dream, the consequences of everything you do on oneto be able to unload general reason.
News comes creeping. This dream is now becoming creeping into realityThere is hardly a chance that such a takeover of ethics could be put into the barriers of human responsibility by self -learning software: decision -makers who wanted to do without more intelligent and reliable machines themselves would act irresponsibly.
If you leave it to her, you will shake the basis of the ethical with the responsibility.What comes afterwards is hardly to be said, because the paths of self -learning software are deep and unfathomable.Jan Söffner is a professor of cultural theory and cultural analysis at the Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen.

Do not torpedo sensible projects / / For general resistance to the euro airport, opposition to the planned rail connection has recently also been added.One should actually think that a rail connection that is to largely replace the diesel bus operation is desirable for left -green protagonists, but is far from it:
Obviously, the always overcrowded BVB bus 50, which tortures itself through the traffic overload and after-work traffic jam, is obviously the more ecological variant.Does anyone believe that the passengers that will always be desolater in the future will prevent passengers from flying from the euro airport?Fire advertisement: Rather, let yourself go there by a taxi or from friends, or you use your own car, which you can easily park there.
Passengers know what they want and does anyone really believe that the airport connection causes significant growth in traffic from BSL?Hardly, because passengers want to fly to a certain destination at a certain price and maybe still with a certain airline.And that in many cases from BSL with the airlines, which make up the majority of the Basel traffic, notabases with the most modern and ecological fleets.
The catchment area of these airlines extends far beyond the horizon of BS / BL.The assumption that passengers (and airlines) absolutely want to fly from the euro airport just because they can switch to a train at the SBB station instead of on the bus is nonsense.Also an argument that is always cited: Zurich bursts at the seams, and a emigration to Basel is desired on the federal government.
Interestingly, new airlines from ZRH will receive starting and landing slots at any time, and there is nothing to be felt from a emigration to Basel: it is in the DNA of Zurich Airport that no air traffic is migrated, and certainly not because of a rail connection.The airport can only be reached via streets via the street.
The rail connection is about effectively reducing individual and bus traffic: a valuable ecological project that should actually be welcome to the environmentally conscious parties, especially since the construction of the new parking garage at the EAP an SP major councilor to prevent it to interpellationbecause it is absurd to aliment the public transport with individual feeder traffic.Obviously, this logic fell by the wayside.
The rail connection is still a good distance from its realization, and conceptually there is still a lot open.It is important, on the other hand, to understand that this deals with part of the S-Bahn heart and not a connection to the international high-speed rail network.And you shouldn't torpedo meaningful projects.

The air is definitely out of the Pneu / / Herbie Schmidtthink tank and startup exchange. At the same timepresented for the future of mobility.Less than usual, the focus of the panel talks, press conferences, presentations and workshops was on the subject of sustainability.
This time it was more about technical progress."If we want to get forward faster, we need partners," explains Florent Menegaux, CEO from Michelin."So we work with universities in research, with startups for inspiration and with joint ventures for outsources of specialist topics such as 3-D printing." But why this event can be asked.
"We want to do more than just take care of the commercial business," said Menegaux."If we want to draw attention to new possibilities of mobility and track down new partners, such an event makes sense." However, some may be wondering whether it is not a contradiction to the desired sustainability if experts and media from all over the world flown to Montrealbecome the results of sustainable mobility."We have to be mobile to get forward," Menegaux ’Lapidare answer.
«Therefore, we fly in many people to show them what we do and what we have already achieved.But all CO2 emissions are compensated for. »Michelin himself presented a world first that already exist on a small scale.With the updis tire that has just been launched, the air is definitely out of the pneu.
The uptis (for unique puncture-proof tire system) looks a little like a spoke wheel and replaces the air between the profile and rim with a sophisticated strut structure made of composite material.Nothing bursts anymore, the product should last as long as the car itself."However, we are aware that the inner structure of the Uptis is vulnerable," explains Michelin development chief Eric Vinesse.
Since the Uptis cannot be adjusted to various street coverings and requirements due to the lack of tire pressure optimization, it does not seem to be suitable for any global application."Tires are world products, but the Uptis will also be tailored to regional special features," explains Yves Chapot, Managing Director at Michelin.“In Japan, the tire has to roll out comfortably and as silently as possible, but in Europe the handling properties are more important.»
The right compromise still has to be found.If the Uptis goes into a row after the plans of the French in 2024, then the trouble is over for a flat foot that still doubles when it turns out that only a small set for the needy in the trunk instead of a spare wheelof the defective tire.But then an entire industry may collapse.
New tires are bought three times less frequently, even if naturally crazy profiles also lead to a new one for airless tires to buy or circulate the profile layer.But whether it still needs something like balancing - Michelin doesn't even know that herself.It is much more important to the French that they take another step towards environmental protection if as many as possible buy the three times more durable Uptis tires-which, by the way, as Vinesse confirms, should also be three times the cost so that the invoice for the manufacturer is.
But there is less rubber because new damaged air tires no longer occur."Sustainability is much more important than number of quantities," says Vinesse.Despite all the advantages in terms of environment and sustainability, the Uptis should only be an intermediate step that gets the finishing touch in partnership with General Motors during extensive tests and the test center.
"GM tests differently than we do, which is why we can perfectly cut the product onto the car," reveals Vinesse.Michelin still strives for the completion of a wheel that corresponds to the vision concept presented two years ago and is completely manufactured with hub.Another branch of industry collapses at the latest: the rim production.
Michelin replaces the air between the profile and the rim with a sophisticated strut structure in the Upti tire.The further development is running, the Uptis tire is scheduled to go into series production in 2024.PD
